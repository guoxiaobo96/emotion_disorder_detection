drd_ssb [info] How do I know I was diagnosed correctly? Over the past 4 years, I have been searching for answers. I have been hospitalized 4 times because of extreme lows. At first, doctors thought I was just severely depressed and would give me SSRIs... that would put me in a manic state and I would go off the walls for months until I hit a low and I end up back at the hospital.. finally I was diagnosed with bipolar 2... after being med compliant for about a year, I started to be self aware and mindful. My girlfriend at the time hated when I was medicated so over the course of 6 months, I worked with my psychologist to get off meds and live a life of a rollercoaster... (because at least my emotions were there) I’ve had problems with drug addiction because of my bipolar.... or at least that’s what they tell me... what if I’m just a drug addict? I’ve been able to stay clean for years at a time, and then something pulls me back. I don’t feel physically addicted to drugs, I’ve done every drug and never had the physical addiction like people do to heroin or meth.. I’ve just always enjoyed it...How do I know or my doctors know if I’m actually bipolar or if drugs affect me to have these mood swings? I’m just ranting.. I wonder if anyone else has problems with drugs and think it’s because of manic/depressive state or it’s just because the addiction to drugs... [info] None [info] 1509935664

yougotmalin [info] I was diagnosed today... Hey everyone, I guess I'm a newbie to your community.I was diagnosed with bipolar today. I'm in a bit of a shock. I don't really know how to respond to it - my initial reaction is that I'm now no longer an "eligible" human, and it basically just confirms all that I've ever known about myself. When I came home and told my parents, they cried and stared at me like I was the Elephant Man or something -- exactly what I asked them not to do.Can you guys give me some tips on how to approach this newfound disorder I have? I'm scared.Thank you in advance. [info] None [info] 1409600338

Jjacobjames [info] Officer in the Coast Guard Hi there,I was in the United States Army as an enlisted infantryman for 9 months when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was then given a medical discharge.Since then, I have gotten my medication sorted and will be taking medication for the rest of my life. I have also been enrolled in college and am two semesters away from graduating. I really appreciated my time in service and really regret not having been capable of finishing my initial contract. I saw that trump recently made it possible for those with bipolar disorder to serve and with that in mind I was looking at possible opportunities. I believe at the time of my discharge Bi\-polar was a bar from service\-however I am very stable with medication. I was wondering if this new policy changes things.Does anyone have any insight into this? [info] None [info] 1527619170
_Just_To_Get_By_ [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar in May, but my psychiatrist is planning on changing my Dx to Borderline when I turn 18 in a couple months.  You can't diagnose yourself.  The only way you can get diagnosed is by a psychiatrist or a qualified mental health professional.  You are looking up the symptom checklist.  The criteria is broad enough that you can diagnose anyone with it if you try hard enough.  Also, think of it this way.  Do you really want the label of Borderline?  A lot of people hate and stereotype Borderlines.  I want my diagnosis to be correct more than anything so I know exactly what is wrong with me so I can try and fix it.  Do you want that?  Or do you just want it so you can flaunt that you have a Dx.If it really concerns you, bring it up with your therapist or psychiatrist. Honestly, what you are describing is just reading off a symptom list, and it doesn't seem that you think there are reasons for you to feel this way.  The major thing about Borderlines is that our disorder is based on how we react to things, where something like bipolar is just how you are with no reason for it.  I'm confident that the Borderline Dx is correct because my psychiatrist specializes in it and he was recommended to me by my therapist, who made the initial suggestion that it was Borderline, while the psychiatrist Dxed me with Bipolar initially, but as I said, he told me he is planning on changing it to Borderline when I turn 18.  I'm okay with the Dx of Borderline as long as it's accurate.  Are you okay with it?  Do you really want a label? [info] 17 [info] 1446001105
IrisKV [info] My answer is probably really "me-centered", but I don't care.My grandfather was an amazing man. He used to be a wealthy doctor, but then sold almost all of his belongings to create a movement/association in Switzerland that helped asylum seeker during the 1980s-1990s I think. He let them stay in his home, and provided them with fake passports. He helped more than 20'000 people ( I think, if I remember correctly) by giving them those passports and helping them find shelter. He fought so much and in such desperate (:illegal) ways, he was supposed to be sent to jail, but could avoid it because he was really sick (bone cancer, I believe). He died when I was only 9 or 8, but we had always had a privileged relation. I don't feel close to many people in my family, but with him I really had a connexion. We used to spend hours just the two of us, making up stories to entertain the other one. After I offered him a small duck made of argile I had made, for Christmas, he wrote me a letter that I only realized years after how touching it was. In it, he said to me that "this duck has saved the holiday for him, in a way nobody really understood". This brings tears to my eyes to this day.Four years ago I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type I, and only this year after two manic episodes, I finally accepted to take medication. When I did so, my mother told me that my grandfather was also sick. She told me that when my grandmother met him, he was standing up on a table in a bar, reciting Goethe in German, and that my grandmother originally called him Pierrot le Fou, in reference to a French movie. They thought he was schizophrenic, but from the information I gathered, he might have been bipolar, just like me. He's the only one in the family to also have had it.So all of this make that if only I could go back in time, I would chose to go back at the time where he was still alive - not the latter days where he suffered through hell, but after he started his organization to help people, and spend some time with him, as an "adult". We would talk of us,  of the amazing things he was doing, I would tell him that as a child and even now, he was one of the person who built who I am, who gave birth to my love of storytelling. I would also ask about his illness, talk about mine. And more importantly, I would have the chance to tell him that even in future, he's the one person I found the most inspiring.

PrettyTalk4 [info] Should I (23f) tell my somewhat toxic family about my mental disorder?  I  live hundreds of miles away from my family. Sadly i didn't have the  best childhood and there were many bad things that happened. This and a  bit of genetic vulnerability made me bipolar. I really struggled with  university and have not finised my undergraduate yet even though  everyone else has graduated. I am on meds now and feel like a whole new  human. There are bad days though. Luckily i work my ass off and am  financially independent.&amp;#x200B;So i want  to visit my family soon and i feel like i want to get it out of my  system. I guess part of me wants to tell them how hard its been and that  I'm not too stupid for uni.&amp;#x200B;But i  think it might be stupid to tell them. My brother (19) does not really  respond when i tell him anything really personal. We are close though.  My father (55) would have a hard time understanding it. But I'm sure  they would be supportive and offer help.&amp;#x200B;I'm most  scared of my mothers (50) reaction. I once told her i was considering  to get therapy because of problems with uni. She cried and asked me if  she had been a bad mother because her mother had made her mentally ill.  She then proceeded to send me articles on adhd while telling me that i  could never have problems focussing. I didn't go to therapy because of  that. One other time i wanted to get therapy and she told me that she  was going to quit her own therapy so that i could get help (huh??). She  bends whatever people tell her and in rage she uses it against you. I  think she would use the bipolar in order to talk badly behind my back  (,''oh, prettytalk4s probably really depressed rn! Please pitty me. By  the way she is such a bad person''). She really mishandled me in  depressive phases before. also she has been violent with me as a child.&amp;#x200B;I told a  friend of mine about not knowing what to tell my family and she  suggested that i just don't tell them my diagnosis. Idk if that would do  anything. What do you guys think?&amp;#x200B;TLDR: I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and want to tell my family but am scared because my mother can be very toxic.

bp2buddy [info] Please don't apologize for sharing your thoughts. It was very poignant and something that I truly needed to hear. I don't know, maybe I respond well to metaphors. I don't like the thought that adulthood comes with dealing with these types of situations that don't easily have a happy ending. And I don't mean easy as in everything falls into your lap precisely the way you want it to with zero effort put forth, I mean in the way that working hard and trying your best actually gives you what you want instead of hitting a wall after you gave everything to achieve your goals... It's painful to think of life that way. You're not reaching in assuming that I'm doing this, in part, to prove to myself that I am better than my family. Especially my mom. I believe everyone when you say that my caring, compassion, and the things that I've done so far is proof enough that I am better than them and her but if the end result is the same -- if he ends up back on the streets, homeless in the snow, disconnected from reality -- am I really any better? Intent vs impact matters to me. But I think I might be thinking too simply about that. All the same, it still feels like an emotional hump I have to scrapple my way over.I just don't want to fail. I can't fail him like everyone else has. I have a hard time getting C's in college courses so to fail at something this important -- I would never be able to look at myself the same way again. But I know that there is a very real chance that I will have to get over that. I recognize that fact because I have been seriously listening to you all and deep inside my rational mind I know that my emotions/hangups/baggage is the true source of my inner turmoil. I took some heavy blows, mentally, a few years ago and soon after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I could not be any less mentally equipped to handle this mental weight, as you put it. I don't understand why I am so irrationally upset at not being strong enough to shoulder this massive weight. I wouldn't beat myself up for not being able to lift a bus off of a bunch of children. But I would do everything in my power to find someone or something that could do what I cannot. I think that's what I'm doing here (which is a change in my course because previously, I was going to shoulder even more of this burden and find him all the resources he needed by myself and not get him a case worker. Poor judgement on my part) but even that much has been hard.Thank you for talking to me and sharing your thoughts. It's such an abstract concept to think that you've seriously impacted the life of a strange you've never even met before but I hope really good things come to you for the time you've taken to help me through such an impossible situation. Bad things happen to people at every second of every day in this world but the things you've said today helped one person feel a good deal better about her life than she did before...

ACaulfield910 [info] My family found out I take lithium. Their reaction makes me regret not killing myself when I had the chance They don't care. They don't give a shit. They just want to believe what they believe and be right. I always put the thought of them in my mind, as a reminder of the hurt I'd evoke if I were to do it. And when I finally decided to seek help, when I finally decided to get myself diagnosed, I was met with negativety. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, taking 300 mg of lithium twice a day. My friends had nothing to say, and encouraged me and saluted me on going (they've seen it all over the years). My mom found my lithium and questioned me, then told me dad. My sister, a med student, goes like "no, you're not bipolar. You can't he diagnosed with bipolar that fast." And my dad hops on the wagon. They yell at me for taking lithium, they don't think I'm depressed, they think I'm fine and have been misdiagnosed. And that's all because I've locked myself away from them ever since I was a teenager. I hid my emotions, I hid everything, I became stoic. Because their reactions have always been like that: they believe what they want to believe, not what's true. And when I tell them I'm depressed, when I finally open up to them, they refuse to believe. At least now I could kill myself without having to worry about them. They never really gave too many shits about me, just about themselves and their beliefs and social status. [info] None [info] 1501857017

electricdog [info] Advice I'm so sick of wanting sex so much. I was diagnosed with bipolar a long time ago. My partner has next to no sex drive. I feel like it's ripping our relationship apart. I always wake up wanting sex. She doesn't ever feel like doing it in the morning. After a while, I stopped bothering her in the morning, and just go and deal with it by myself. I want it before bed. Another time that she's never in the mood. Always too tired. So I stay up and take care of it, otherwise I can't sleep. I feel unloved because she never wants to have sex with me. I feel rejected every time I want sex, almost automatically, because all I can remember is all the times she pushed me away, or told me that she wasn't In the mood(after I told her she needs to verbalize instead of just pushing me away) it's happened so many times. I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sometimes, just waking up and imagining the rejection can totally fuck my mood for the day. I feel unattractive. I feel unloved. It's hard to make sense of someone else's sex drive when you're is the polar opposite. I went so far as to tell her when we first got together, that this was something that I needed, and that I was totally serious. She said it wasn't a problem. I've told her about my kinks, but she's never so much as tried to incorporate anything. Now, I'm considering asking my psychiatrist for drugs to make these urges go away. I don't want to be begging for it all the time. It makes me feel dirty, and not in a good way. I don't know what to do. I don't even want to have sex anymore, but I need it. It makes me feel like she's unwilling, and I'm forcing it. How do you deal with it? What can I do to help myself? Is medication the answer? Have you ever tried it? Did it work? I've tried antidepressants, but they only ever give me anorgasmia. Nothing has ever made the desire to away. Please give me your advice. [info] None [info] 1495483698
shillyshally [info] I was always more awake at night than during the day but now that I don't work my sleeping has become utterly without structure. Anyway, the reason I asked about meds is because I was diagnosed with bipolar II long before it became 'popular' and thus was kind of a guinea pig for numerous drug treatments. Some of those drugs had very bizarre side effects. This is pure speculation but I wonder if the melatonin is putting you into a neverland between sleep and wakefulness so that you did the drawing when you were somewhat asleep. Such things do happen.

coltmar [info] How to maintain boundaries fresh after the split-up? My 18 month old's father and I split up about 6 months ago. He was my first real love (22 F) and the only guy I'd really had a serious relationship with. We lived together and I thought we would have a future, but to make a long story short he cheated multiple times and I had to walk away even though I stayed so long because I wanted my son to have a family together. We are now long distance within each other (my son stays with me mainly), so we have the arrangement that he sees him one week of the month or a couple of weekends of the month. Sometimes he'll get aggravated because I can't make the drive three hours away all the time to take my son, but I told him his visitation should be his responsibility as far as transportation goes. He doesn't have a reliable vehicle though so I accomodate as best as I can and still bring my son up to see him at least once a month.  Other than that, we get along well for the most part. He's a good father and he sends us some money and does pay for my gas when I take my son up to see him. I guess the problem is we get along TOO well. He calls me every single day, and not always about our son. He tells me he loves me and honestly I'll admit I say it back, even though we both know we can't get back together. I'm ashamed to admit we've had sex a few times whenever I would see him again (I've got the bc implant so at least I don't have to worry about getting pregnant again). I'm very hurt over him but it's like part of me just can't let go and neither can he. I know I need to though for the sake of my son because he doesn't need to grow up confused about his mom and dad's relationship. This is just so hard for all of us and I'm feeling numb from it all. Our son was unplanned and I'll admit we weren't prepared to become parents but we're trying our absolute hardest. My mental health has declined substantially. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after having my son and the stress of all this just triggered a major depressive episode that won't go away. My son is the only thing I care about anymore, other than that I feel like doing nothing and I don't feel anything at all. I don't even feel like a person anymore as weird as it sounds. I moved back in with my parents for the time being until I finish school, and while I'm so grateful for the support and help with watching him while I work, it's so hard when I feel like such a failure. How can I effectively coparent while still maintaining boundaries with him? [info] None [info] 1587965700

Paczkl [info] [Serious] I'm one year away from graduating and strugling with lots of things I never actually learned First time posting here, first time browsing this sub also.I'm finishing my fifth year of med school and only have one more yaar to go.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder five years ago, I was at my second year of school at the time and due to many depressive episodes plus an exchange program I'm two years late om my graduation, which is not a problem.The problem is that because I've struggled with mental health issues since day one of my graduation (actually since my childhood),so I never got to put the effort needed on my education as I've always has to balance passing classes while not getting into another depressive episode.Hypomanic episodes did not helped either, as school became the lest priority on my list even though I used to engage in many extracurricular activities.I also have ADHD, which never helped learning anything.That being said, I'm one year away from graduating and have major gaps on my knowledge in every single field of study. I lack lots of basic information, like physiology and therefore phisiopathology of diseases, basic anatomy, etc, etc.Posponding my graduation one more year is out of question as I can't really use any extended time anymore.I'm looking for advice on sources and strategies to fill those gaps and catch up with everything I've missed (or at least most of if).What do you guys think I should focus on? Do you suggest any strategies? Is there an order of systems or subjects that would help me learning and retaining information better or easier?I feel that I have a lot to do and no time left.

Zerimas [info] I was worried about the thighs being too small. In the last 4 months I went from wearing N&amp;F Weird Guys in size 30 (which actually measures 32" and they were stretch) to needing a 36" waist.

Upon reviewing this potato quality picture, I noticed that my ass fills out the  pants—but the thighs not so much. From the front I find it to look pretty satisfactory. Maybe the goal of filling out the thighs will give me something to shoot for?I am probably overly self-conscious. I have never struggled with my weight.

keasbey15 [info] I'm providing a tl;dr at the top for those not ready for this. So **tl;dr: I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS, went to a treatment center, got diagnosed with Asperger's upon discharge.**My diagnoses wasn't really a realization of me being different. I mean, I knew I was different than everyone else. But that didn't make me think I had Asperger's, considering I'm still a kid and didn't learn about it until I met a fellow Aspergian in my Networking class. So as a child my parents noticed mood swings and things commonly associated with Bipolar disorder. They took me to a therapist when I was about 8 and from there I got diagnosed. They didn't consider Asperger's, I'm not sure why, but I got slapped with a bipolar NOS diagnoses. So 8 years later and about 16,000 medications ago, I was in a really bad place (Manic every day, outbursts at school and home, a couple episodes of psychosis. The usual bipolar shindig.) My parents, at the recommendation of my psychiatrist, sent me to a Youth Mental Health Treatment Center. There I became fairly stable, found the right balance of medication and therapy and made my way back into the world. After discharging from an in-patient treatment center, I did weekly therapy at an out-patient treatment center and had the best therapist of my life. He started noticing things like my Obsessive-compulsive tendencies, my aversion of eye contact, unnatural fear of trivial things, etc. etc. He told my parents that I have Asperger's. He didn't want to tell me considering all I went through in that time so I didn't know until early last year. It changed my view on everything and I took it surprisingly well. I sought out information on Asperger's and became knowledgeable on the subject. I think it made me feel better because it gave me an answer to why I am the way I am, and I've accepted it as a blessing rather than a curse. It's been an uphill struggle trying to be seemingly neurotypical but I learned skills without knowing, I figure I can survive while being diagnosed.  [info] None [info] 1358325044

jpupsss [info] I’m so sorry to hear that. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago and it definitely changes the range of emotions, logic, and self control one has. Continued therapy and medication if necessary can be very helpful, but support and understanding is necessary too. Having conversations about her self esteem and overreactions may help her have better awareness and control. [info] None [info] 1573249289
Mistressofthedark13 [info] I [21F] having problems with my [20M] father of my kids, I feel like we're in an endless loop and I don't know where it's going So I've been living with my ex, we have been best friends since high school (since 2008). We use to be so madly in love and use to be perfect for each other, we had all the same hobbies, could relate to each other and he always made me happy.Well in senior year of high school I ended up getting pregnant, (2013) and this is where the story becomes a bit twisted. When our daughters were just 6 months old we had a big fight and I eventually moved back into my moms after only living together for a year. My mom convinced me to do things I wouldn't have normally ever thought of, like take him to court for custody of the kids. Because I was grieving the loss of the relationship, and seeking a way to get back at him for hurting me I did what my mom said.Fast forward a year we started talking again and things were getting better, I even moved back in with him July of 2014. We've been living together for over a year now and we both want the relationship, but me myself have some issues (after the birth of my twins I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not wanting to except it I stopped taking meds and going to therapy). I thought everything was going great till recently we have been going to school on different campus and I've been noticing changes. Now to present day we recently had a big fight that has left me in the current turmoil I'm in now, and why I'm reaching out for some advice. Since our big fight he has put a password on his phone and I'm not allowed to touch his home at all. He has never been one for passwords which concerns me. When I talk to him he says there are no other girls he just wants his "privacy" and brings up that we aren't together.I still want to be with him, and he says he still wants to be with me but that we aren't happy anymore. Which is true and I've noticed I've been getting worse so I'm seeking treatment in order to keep whatever is left. He says he wants to be friends first, so he knows that we can always be happy an laugh, so it's not all based on just affection. I see where he is coming from but lately he's been sneaking around behind my back and trying to cover things up but I feel like there is more going on. I really want this to work but I feel like our history is blocking me to trying to just be friends with him. I'm scared of loosing him because he's been the one person that's always helped me through everything, and we have 2 kids together. It's not the fact that I don't think i can't find anyone else, because I know I can but I just want to be with him. I need help on how to keep this relationship. How do I just be friends with someone you have 2 kids and share the same bed with? Anyone been in my shoes, I'd love to hear your words of advice/story.TL;DR; How do you be friends with some you have 2 kids with and still love, that you still live with and share a bed with. I feel like he's hiding something, I don't know what, he says he wants the relationship but just not right now. [info] None [info] 1443582116
OKC_Zeke1792 [info] The journey to 90 pounds of weight loss (long post) My situation was unique. I competed  in NPC men’s physique. I was placing well at tHR shows I did and was getting ready to make a push for nationals and beyond. Then I was hit across the face with something Inever saw coming. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and a mild form of psychosis. I had the symptoms for years, yet I thought everyone went through hearing voices or extreme highs and lows in personality. I thought I was “normal” After my last show in 2014, I didn’t place well. I was really feeling the symptoms of my illnesses and prep wasn’t what it should have been. I couldn’t cope well with the loss, so I turned to alcohol and hard drugs as an escape. In a span of 2 years, 2015-2017, i ballooned to 280 pounds. 100 pounds over my stage weight of 180 pounds. 2018 I decided enough was enough. I lost everything in 2018. My girlfriend, friends, and everything I thought I needed. A look in the mirror was like staring at a body that couldn’t sink. I was haunted by my own reflection. Instead of taking blame, I blamed everyone else. Then I hit a new low. I came to see I was the problem. April of 2018, i decided to change. I researched tracking macros and optimal splits designed around weaknesses. It was embarrassing going back to the very gym where I was in my best shape at one point and feeling like I didn’t belong. I fought through this. I subscribed to a site called hypertrophycoach in May of 2018. Everyday I would watch videos and eventually formulated my own split. I’ve been running a split now that targets my weak points with high frequency and my stronger parts with high intensity. IT IS TO NOTE THAT I STARTED TRACKING MORE INTENTIONALLY WHEN I HIT 230 POUNDS. Day 1: Delts, tricepDay 2: hams, quads Day 3: back, bicepDay 4: chest, rear deltDay 5: hams, biceps, triceps Day 6:  chest, back, deltWith the help of Joe Bennett, aka hypertrophycoach, I was able to make a split geared towards me weaknesses. PPL would often leave me tired or I’d forget to hit something. For cardio, I stuck with traditional bro style 2x day 4x week. Phase 1: 30 am 30 pm Phase 2; 45 am 35 pmPhase 3: 45 am 45 pm Phase 4: 1 hour am 45 pm Next time, I am going to count steps instead. Maybe do cardio 2-3x week single day? We will see. Nutrition was more streamline following a macro plan instead of a food plan. Although I ended up eating some of the same things each day, I enjoyed the freedom and the creativity that I could implement. I started with 240p 225c 65fChanged to 240p 205c 60f Then to 240p 185c 55f Lastly 230-240p 165c 50fThe result of sobriety, being medicated properly, and self care got me here https://i.imgur.com/KDc4bAH.jpgFor reference I am 5’11. I went from 280-190. My next plan is to hit 205 with single to low double digit body fat by September. I plan on competing again in 2020. For now, I want to enjoy my new frame and enjoy the happiness  I am experiencing. Being manic and hearing voices for so long makes you grateful for a clear mind. Thank you for reading my story. This community is a gold mine. I’ve learned a lot from you all and will continue to. [info] None [info] 1556127266
Helen_Damnation [info] I am concerned my former employer is slandering me and keeping me from being hired. What can I do? First, let me provide you with background:I live in CT. I am 36 and have 2 BS degrees in Chemistry and Biology. I have been steadily employed since I was 16 in legitimate tax-paying jobs. In the past 12 years I have had two employers prior to the one I am speaking of and have an excellent record with great references and fantastic yearly reviews.I began working for a company (I'll call it PE for the rest of the post) in Jan 2011 through a temp to hire position. I was intimately familiar with the machine they were developing a new prototype for. I was salary but I worked ten hour days for a month before they (and I) realized they needed someone with software programming experience which was not in the job description I was hired for and what they admitted they didn't think ahead for. It was all on good terms and they even hired me for a permanent position in the manufacturing area where I would be beta testing the machine after the software glitches were worked out.Now, move forward two months. I became very sick and needed hospitalization for almost two weeks before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was allowed short term disability at my doctor's insistence until I was stabilized on medications that would allow me to work effectively, and PE agreed (they knew I was sick but didn't know anything about my diagnosis). Six weeks went by and I really wanted to return to work. My doctor signed off on it and PE required all medical records in order to allow me to return. I had the Dr fill out the forms and signed off to have my records sent.Two weeks went by and despite my calling PE's HR department I still received no reply. I finally reached them and they said they never received the documentation. My Dr insisted they were sent but I went through the process of getting all of them together again and had them sent. Another week, same response from PE. No documents.This time I went through the process again but hand delivered them to the PE building. I receive a letter in the mail that if they aren't received in two days they will have to terminate my employment with them. I called them again and after a few days was told that they still had no records. I was unable to get the documents together within the next two days and was "let go" for failure to provide documentation.I had to fight for unemployment benefits and the state sided with me, thank god. I have been unemployed since Nov 2011. Despite my excellent work history before PE, my many professional references, and my two degrees I still haven't been able to find work - even jobs grossly below my pay scale. I am concerned that PE may be slandering me to people calling for reference info and, worse, that they may have let me go due to my being bipolar. I don't know what to do!Sorry for the long post. I am desperate and I really hope someone here can point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance! [info] None [info] 1349638544
XofSwords [info] Spirits and Hallucinations Hi! Baby witch here, I didn’t know where else to post this because I haven’t been on reddit for very long... and I’m so sorry for the long post. 😅 I don’t know what to believe in when encountering the otherworldly, or even what to call it or how to be respectful or if I’m really just crazy. I’ve had a few ‘spirit’ experiences in the past, both negative and benign (although they could have been anything), and I’ve regularly seen and felt stirring things, especially when I was little, that have made me certain there are a lot of different forces at work in the world. What gives me pause is that I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2, and I have heard that the my mood swings can cause hallucinations. Some of the more prominent things I’ve experienced (that I can’t explain and don’t know what they are) are reoccurring shadow figures who travel along walls, a woman with my mother’s face I notice at the end of dark hallways, seeing parts of old structures, like wooden ceiling beams, appearing in normal buildings, and general intense feelings of speaking to something I can’t hear or understand. Again, I’m sorry this post is so long. There aren’t many people to talk to about this. If anyone can help me piece out what’s real and what isn’t and tell me what it means, I would be extremely grateful. 🌸 [info] None [info] 1564248466

But for the past two weeks I talk so incredibly much and I can't help it. My mind is constantly going 300 miles an hour and so very little of it makes sense. I'm really worried that I'm in a manic phase and it's going to get worse. And if that wasn't enough, my head keeps telling me how annoying I am and that no one really wants to put up with me. I told you I was diagnosed with bipolar but it's been really well regulated, what if something is wrong?

I moved back in with my mom but it's a super shitty situation here.

kannala457 [info] TB In May, It will be two years since the last time I saw you. I shouldn't still think about you, but I do every day. I think about how smart and incredible you are, and how much you made me laugh and smile and how wholly accepted I was by you in our time together. I think about who you might be now and I hope you are doing something you love and surrounded by great people. And I think about everything I did - and was - that ruined us.I was stubborn. I was jealous, unfair, moody, unpredictable, manipulative, and in ways out of touch with reality. I lashed out about things that didn't matter. I drank far too much. I set so many unreasonable ultimatums. And then, in my mind, I made all of these things your fault and left you.Since I last saw you, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have been in therapy and taking medication, and it's like a fog that clouded my memory and perception of how we began and ended has been lifted.Part of me wants to throw myself at your feet and apologize for everything that I said and did that hurt you and ask to be in your life again. Another part of me knows that I can't ever, ever hurt you again, and that even mentioning memories of our past could do that to you.But know that if I could do all of it again, I would choose you, and I would fight for you.To sum up everything here, I found a quote from our favorite movie fitting:"I'm sorry about everything. I'm sorry about me."-K [info] None [info] 1550873630
buttscrew [info] I can actually kind of talk about this from an experience I had. In 2007, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was forcibly medicated in a psychiatric hospital. Being a broke college kid at the time, and having no health insurance when I was discharged after ten days in the hospital. I couldn't afford the $700/month for the antipsychotic medication I was prescribed.   I suddenly stopped taking the medication and have a ten day black spot in my memory. I have heard a few accounts from my family of my actions during this time. I was alive and moving but no one was home. When I regained consciousness I was back in the hospital on day 7 of another 10 day stent. I complained vocally about this feeling of numbness at first, however, quickly got used to it and forgot what it was like to feel. Things seemed so foreign to me. I had a hard time doing simple tasks like driving without huge feelings of paranoia and a reduced sense of direction.When I awoke, I was numb. I had a very distinct feeling of disconnection in my brain. Everything I knew about myself, the city I lived in, and myself as a person was gone. I could actually feel a disconnection in my brain. Two years into therapy I had a therapist suggest that this what I felt in my head was brain damage that occurred from my manic episodes.I went through more therapy and went through all five stages of grief for myself. I buried who I was and adapted to this new form. It wasn't all bad, the brain is a very powerful organ. I had a good job and a nice bit of money saved up. I could tell something was off about me though, the suggestion of brain damage was constantly on my mind as I felt this disconnection from others. During this time, I didn't establish very many meaningful relationships. I was perpetually single and had only gained a few acquaintances from my job. There was something that other people had that I just didn't seem to get. I really didn't think about it all that much and just kind of chalked it up to my disorder and the damage it had done. I had been living in this state of emotionless being for 6 years at this point. In June of 2013, I started a new medication and ceased my long lived relationship with the antipsychotic. One night, I was standing in my room looking at a picture and it a moment, it happened. The hemispheres of my brain realigned and I was overcome by emotion. I felt a rebirth, my brain had a familiar sense of the world again. In a instant I was teleported back to who I was at 21 years old just in my 28 year old body. Now, I identify as having two "selves", the person I am today, and the person who I was during those 6 years of non-emotion. This quick transition didn't come without it's own challenges. Skills and habits I had developed while working almost vanished entirely. I had to relearn (and admittedly still am) stuff like personal financial responsibility but, at the same time things like driving were back to being familiar and absent of  fear. My map of the town I lived in was back inside my brain.  My break in consciousness I did wholeheartedly think of as a death. I had known and accepted this although it took years of therapy to do so. Denial is a powerful force.    Now, I feel as though I am whole again. Even if the last few years have been a lot rockier than their predecessors. Self is absolutely a series of not only memories but emotions and sense of being.    TL:DR I was reincarnated in my own body.Sorry if this got a little off topic. It's kind of a hard thing to explain.Edit: Also, I have been knocked the fuck out before and I pretty much equate that to death. [info] None [info] 1417528893

MuchoMaas49 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 about 2 years ago and it has been really great actually. I got the diagnosis from a couple of people who should not have made it, they always put me on prozac and welbutrin. I always ended up becoming more emotionally volatile and ended up not being able to handle myself emotionally.When I went to an actual psychiatrist, they ended up giving me this drug called Lamotrigine. Well, it's crazy but it's amazing, completely turned my emotions around, and for my entire life I never had a way to self-sooth until I started taking the drug. It's not all that common, but I recommend you talk to your psychiatrist about it as an option. At this time I only take adderall and lamotrigine, and just an FYI, it's far more likely that you're bipolar type II, so make sure you read up on it, so you know that your doctor knows what he's talking about.

DaddyCouchPotato [info] Goodbye to drugs Hello Reddit, I am aware that this will probably not get much attention but I'd like to put my story out there, and maybe warn people going down the same pathI am currently entering my third year in college and have been using a plethora of drugs since I was 15 (Mainly LSD). My psychedelic use GREATLY influenced my life. I thought, because of all of success I've had with it, there's no way I have a pre-existing mental condition I don't know about. Well I was wrong. Three days ago I had a full on psychotic episode (Not even while under the influence of anything). I could make a whole post on that alone so all I'll say is that it was easily one of my most horrifying experiences in my life. I went to my psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This scared the living shit out of me, but I knew I had to stop with drugs all together. It has been three days and I already feel better. I've been meditating and reading a lot and those two things work wonders. But who knows how much my substance abuse has progressed this disease? It may have never even been an issue for me if I stayed safe. I gambled with my sanity and paid the price.Some of you may feel invincible, but if there's even a thought in your mind that you might have a mental condition please be careful. Tldr: Had a psychotic episode three days ago and knew I had to stop using drugs.If anyone has questions I would be happy to answer  them with the best detail I can. Stay safe reddit.

needsmorecoffee [info] If you're having trouble with specific medications, that doesn't mean you should give up on medications in general. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 17, more than 20 years ago. I was on lithium for a few months, which didn't work out. Tegretol for a large handful of years, until I needed the dosage upped and started getting toxicity effects. Depakote and effexor for a long time; went off the effexor when it caused debilitating insomnia. Went off of the depakote after about 9 years because I started losing my hair. Next was trileptal, which lasted all of a month before my sodium dropped. Now I'm on lamictal, which so far is working out really well.Anyway. This is not meant to make you think that all meds are crap. If you look at the fact that I went through that many meds in 22 years, it really isn't that bad. Most of the time that I was medicated I was doing fine. It's normal, however, for your medication needs to change over time, and it's also normal for it to be difficult to pinpoint exactly what combination of meds will work best for you.If need be, you find a new psychiatrist. When I had the debilitating insomnia, my psychiatrist at that time told me I'd be fine if I just walked for 10 minutes a day and completely ignored me when I told him I was already working out and had been for some time (most doctors automatically assume bad food and exercise habits if you're overweight---and the effexor had also caused me to gain 70 pounds). It took a sleep specialist to immediately pinpoint the effexor as the problem.So, off I went in search of yet another psychiatrist. My city is lousy with them, but there's a distinct paucity of GOOD psychiatrists. I finally got someone to recommend a clinic they thought was good. The psychiatrist there didn't take my insurance, but it was worth it. (The extra medications I was taking to treat the problems caused by the effexor cost well more than what I'm paying out-of-pocket for the psychiatrist. That's how bad it can be to have a crappy psychiatrist.)Anyway. I got off of the effexor, was able to sleep again, immediately lost 12 pounds (35 total at this point). Since I went on the lamictal I'm starting to feel motivation and energy I haven't felt in years, so I'm cautiously optimistic about that.The sodium level drop from the trileptal was serious enough that I had to drop off of it over just two days, and the lamictal takes 5 weeks to get up to dosage on. I had several weeks of being essentially unmedicated. It had been 22 years since I'd last been in that position, and as horrid as the experience was, in some ways it's done me good to have the reminder that no, really, it can get that bad, and despite the troubles, the medication is VERY worthwhile. My amazing husband saw me through those really tough weeks, and I hate how difficult it was on him. I think most people probably wouldn't have been able to be nearly so supportive. Bipolar is hell on us, but it's also hell on the people around us, which is important to remember.I don't know anyone with bipolar who has successfully gone off their meds long-term. Everything I've always seen and heard indicates that it's a life-long treatment thing. Medication problems can be bad, but they can also be temporary if you work at continuing to try to find the right ones. The results of not taking your medication, however, can be far more devastating and potentially long-lasting. See if your current psychiatrist can help you find the right mix; it can, after all, take time and experimentation. If you get the feeling long-term that your psychiatrist can't help you, find a new one. Try to get recommendations from other patients or your primary care doctor for someone they think does a good job. [info] BP2/ADD/PTSD/GAD/kitchen sink [info] 1354058569
chaosandpie [info] Kind of lost, am I making progress? So I was diagnosed with bipolar2 not quite a year ago. It was shocking and scary, but everything pretty much made sense after doing some research on my own. What is bothering me is that when I spoke to my family about it I received very little support. My grandmother talked to me a few times, as she's BP2 and has been treated and stable for a long time. She’s been great. My mother however, has said nothing. I have tried talking to her through the battle of finding the right medication, the paranoia, the really bad lows that came with finding out I will have to be medicated to be 'myself'... it all fell on deaf ears. She never checked on me or asked me if I was ok. She always turned the conversation to her problems and struggles, which I always tried to help her with. Pretty sure she’s BP2, but she’s never been diagnosed. Then there's my egocentric little sister (21) that goes in between all of us and causes drama and that's a whole other (but still pretty relevant) story. Her and my mom both tend to fabricate stories and run to each other with the latest gossip.Anyways, I recently decided, being a full-time college student with three kids and a man, I have enough on my plate without all of the drama and started sticking to myself. I flat out have nothing to do with my sister and only talk to my mom when she initiates conversation, but I am very careful about what I will talk about and how I say things. Last week was the first time I stood up to my mom. She called me raging about something stupid (without context, she just clothes-lined me) and I put my foot down. Now I'm the bad guy, throwing everything she does for me (which is pretty much nothing anyways) in her face and being ungrateful. I told her at the end of this conversation that I loved her, didn't feel like I was being mean or malicious and that I didn't retract anything that I told her. I was honest, but really careful how I worded it and made sure to make the point that I am just exhausted trying to figure myself out, I didn't want to have to deal with all of the drama going on in our extended family.. She ignored my call today. I left her a message reiterating that I love her and I hope she's having a good day. I’m battling now between second-guessing myself (even though my bf says that I am really doing the right thing in limiting this toxic relationship) and being proud of myself for finally taking a stand. Is it right of me to want peace and time to process who I am and not want all of the added distraction of toxic family drama, or am I being selfish? [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1462760951

My partner and I kept a count one time and I had 40 intense orgasms in the space of 1.5 hours, before we stopped counting. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It turns out that I was hypersexual last year and my libido and sexual responsiveness were off the charts. My orgasm rate and intensity is much lower now that I’m not manic. Interesting fact, though - we discovered that I could cum just from having a certain spot on my back pressed, with no other stimulation required.  [info] None [info] 1538911965

For the longest time, I thought I wanted to join the Reserves or National Guard (yeah yeah totalBootlicker) and then I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.We are banned from serving in the military. Not only that, but I regularly get asked if I have a mental disability when applying to norma civilian jobs.If we’re medicated, we should be considered on a case by case basis. There shouldn’t be a blanket ban on anyone who isn’t neurotypical. I feel like the stigma is the problem more so than the actualIllness. [info] None [info] 1588085650
fdc7719 [info] If it’s alright to ask, what meds have you tried? I know based on other comments that there have been many, but I’d still like to ask. I was diagnosed with bipolar II several years ago and had tried so many meds leading up to that point. Lamictal as a mood stabilizer was life changing for me. I know everyone responds differently to different meds, but I still wanted to ask about your list in case there’s anything missing that either of us haven’t tried. It seems like the most effective antidepressants for me have pretty bad sexual side effects which always leaves me taking certain ones only when things get really bad. Exercise helped immensely until my health declined a year ago. [info] None [info] 1561329040
Beetzart [info] Yep, I know it is not a mental illness.  I should have said I have been diagnosed with bipolar and I take drugs for that.   And that is what I was talking to my brother about.  Interestingly I have just been prescribed Abilify and noticed that it has been used in certain small trials and shown to be helpful with autistic traits like irritability and stereotypical behaviour.    This might mean nothing and I am only going on what I read on a couple of sites.   I am sure there are others here with a better insight then I into this.

infj1029 [info] Finally hit my second (and perhaps final goal weight)! 150 to120 lbs :) Thanks, everyone! &lt;3 *progress pictures [how I looked at my heaviest, at different years 2017 and 2015](https://imgur.com/a/OiF4S)[recent picture of me, but me trying really hard to look cute lol](https://imgur.com/a/DJ3yw)Measurements: **waist**: 29 in**bust**: 35**under bust**: 31**butt**: 35I am a rectangle shape girl naturally, thus very little waist definition and little curves. But hey, I still have some boobs and I think I look cute despite not having an hour shape figure ;)The last few pounds feels like it took the longest, but I'm finally at **120 lbs**. :) My gym was doing body fat compositions today, and I found out mine was **22%**. My first goal weight was 125 but once I hit that, I was like "what the heck, let's keep going." Right now, I like the way my body looks but I might want to lose a few more pounds and tighten up my body. It's just something I'm still deciding on. :)It's been quite the long journey for me. When I was younger, I ate whatever I wanted and didn't gain weight. Thus, I ate horribly. Finally, when I turned 18, all those bad food choices got to me. I saw my prom pictures and finally saw how big I got and how unattractive I was. I didn't eat healthier but I went to the gym and did a bit of cardio. It did nothing to help me lose weight or look better. Eventually, I stopped and got even bigger. Then college stressed started to add up and I was diagnosed with bipolar. Food was clutch for me and I ate until I felt better. I also finally had a butt and boobs and I thought my curves canceled out my fat. It was like this for all four years of college and during my senior year, I was my heaviest, at 150ish. I was so in denial about my weight, that honestly, I don't know my exact heaviest. I just remember it being in the 150s. I was so embarrassed and hated the way I looked. I didn't even take senior pictures. A friend did take pictures of me at graduation, but I never posted those photos. They're the ones you see above. I just felt so ugly, inside and out. Graduation was supposed to be a special day and I wanted to take pictures too feel good, but I robbed myself of that because of my insecurities. Around June, my boyfriend made a comment above my weight (he had good intentions, he's just bad with words and understanding this isn't something a girl wants to hear -___-) and it made me realize that I am overweight and need to something about it. I'm not sure how, but I found this sub and I learned about calorie tracking. I tracked every day and started working out 3-4x a week.  Although I work out a bit, I work in an office job and probably spend 23 hours of my day sedentary lol. Eventually, all of this became really fun for me. I love finding new recipes and find lower calorie alternatives. I learned workouts that I enjoy and do those. (For example, I hateeeee cardio so I only do it once per week) I learned a lot about self-love and loving my body through this process. I was also really sick in the past and realized how much my choices affected my health. Thus, I did this all for me and to better myself. I am really happy now. My relationship is with food has changed, and I see it as a fuel source instead of a therapist. My journey is still not over, and I'm still trying to improve. :) ----TL;DR: Lost 30 lbs. :) [info] 5'1.5 SW 150 CW 120 [info] 1511210288
Silly_Sloth_Owl [info] Oh god. This is so real for me.Especially since I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I worry it may mean I am about to have an episode or something. Even when I am stable, though, I am still worried that something is wrong.Not having a reason to be worried seems to worry me.

orisonblasp [info] I desperately need to find a roommate but don't know how to tell people I have a debilitating mental illness that affects at home life. So I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for several years now and just recently it has come to light that I definitely have BPD(Borderline). I'm unsure if I was just misdiagnosed with bipolar or if I just simply have both but regardless. Basically what it all boils down to is I stay in my room for 90% of the hours or days or months. If you live with me you might not even see me come out of my room for 3-5 days. I cannot hold a job at all and am applying for disability so I'm not working. I don't know how to tell these things to someone I have never met before in hopes that I can become there roommate. I'm in a very bad living situation and I need to get out desperately. Several months ago I was living still with my parents who have always been severely emotionally abusive. I couldn't handle it anymore after the last full out war- after being told to kill myself again after being told I was just a lazy piece of shit and need to get a job again I had had enough I couldn't take it anymore.  I packed some clothes and blankets into my car and I lived in a Walmart parking lot for awhile. Living in a car fucking sucks. After a while I had gotten really sick and was on my period at the same time, two things that made living in a car absolutely unbearable. My sister and BIL had been telling me to come stay with them for a while which I was resisting cause they're just like miny copies of my parents and have no empathy for mental illness. But I was worn down I just wanted to sleep in a bed again. I told them disability can take over a year- they said okay okay we understand we understand. That lasted a week. My BIL is a very abusive and controlling person, he has threatened physical violence, threatened to kick me out because I haven't showered when he wants me to, a lot of shit, hes a bastard. And I'm just getting more and more suicidal as each day goes by at the thought of still having to live in awful situations, I'm just so exhausted.So basically I need out rn before I'm back in my car. In my parents usual gaslighting honeymooning way, they've tried to buy back my love with a lump sum of money that I can use for rent for the next 12-12.5 months. The money is all  in my control and they have no ability to use it against me. But now heres my problem, I don't know how to tell people all of this. How to explain I'm not working but I can securely pay rent. Or that I'm gonna be in my room almost always. I need to be out within the week. Please please please of you have any advise I need it.

Emshelles [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar post partum, but it really reared it’s head during my pregnancy. There were so many times I did things they confused me, I got very paranoid of the world and irritable. It caused a lot of strife between my husband and me. Then after delivery I had PPD at 1 month, 8 months, 13 months, and 19 months when I weaned her was the worse. It led to me losing my job. That’s when I got diagnosed and out on Lexapro and Latuda. I’m terrified that to get pregnant again I would go through all that but some medications are safe during pregnancy and I trust my psychiatrist to guide me. It can be done as long as you have a plan, a loving patient partner, and a great psychiatrist. [info] None [info] 1573792835

kslidz [info] that someone that is a christmas fanatic is a good example of how ocd presents itself. people are stupid man until I was in my late teens I thought bipolar was multiple personality disorder, then I thought schizophrenia was multiple personality disorder. And this wasn't because I thought this on my own this was something that lots of flippant usage of these terms implicated.  I really didn't learn a lot until I was diagnosed with bipolar. And now when people find out lots of them will act differently or treat me in ways that doesn't even make sense. There is a ton of misinformation and although many people know better, tons don't. It's the same reason I stopped making racist jokes. I never believed any of the stuff I was joking about I just thought it was an absurd concept. But I learned that lots of people think it's funny because they believe it to be true and telling the jokes reinforces their preconceived notions of what it means to be a particular race. Now I'm not saying it's on the same scale, mind you, just that it is the same guiding principal. [info] None [info] 1555685098
aquatictherapy [info] I remember finally asking for help and joking with my therapist, “Just as long as I don’t have bipolar or schizophrenia.” Guess what? I was diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling with manic episodes mimicking paranoid schizophrenia. Sucked big time because I always thought of those two like the “big” mental disorders. No way did I want to be “crazy” like those people.The thing holding her back might be her own prejudices and fear. She has a mom and aunts with this so she might be projecting their experiences into her own life. She might be afraid of getting the official diagnosis. She might assume that life as she knows it is over. In a way it is. I have a recognized disability. One that’s hidden. One that I listen to people use all the time as an adjective. Could you imagine hearing someone say, “OMG! I feel so diabetic today! I ate two pieces of cake!”? I’ve had more than one person say, “OMG! I’m so bipolar! I can’t decide what dress to wear!” It hurts because they’re using something I struggle with every stinking day to describe a problem so trivial that it’s embarrassing. As if not knowing what to wear is tantamount to a major mental illness.I’ll be honest; medication sucks balls. I’ve never found a medication that didn’t have shitty side effects. I’m tired and groggy every morning. At any point in the day I feel like taking a nap. I’m so freaking hungry all the time, especially at night while taking medication. But the alternative is feeling like I want to peel off my skin because my nerve endings are electrifying and I’m hearing and seeing shit that isn’t there. So I suck it up and take the damn medication knowing that so many people think I’m addicted to it. I’m not and would love to chuck the lot of them into the toilet and flush that shit goodbye. I’ve been through ten med changes in fifteen years. Ten. And finally have found the right dosage. But guess what? In a year or six months that “right dosage” could change and become not effective or the FDA might approve another medication my psychiatrist wants to try and were back at square one.And take the way we’re portrayed in the media. The bipolar ones are always on a psychotic break. They’re the homeless man down the street taking to himself. I’m a thirty something woman with a full time job, two beautiful daughters, and two degrees. But when people hear that they either think that I’m A) faking the mental illness because no way would someone like me be able to accomplish anything or B) take everything I do and turn it into a huge deal and praise the shit out of it because of all I’ve “overcome.” So yeah, she might be looking at all these things and thinking (rightly so) that it sucks. And she might not want to go through it all. But I truly believe everyone has that breaking point where they say, “I’m not feeling right and I am sick of it.” If her therapy didn’t work the first few times, she needs to switch therapists. If her medication doesn’t work the first few times, she needs to change it. Sucks but there you have it. As a husband all you can do is support her through it all as best you can.BUT, if she’s thinking about hurting herself or someone else, you MUST call emergency services immediately. Period. No questions asked. She’s your wife and you need to protect her even if it’s from herself.Tl;dr: bipolar sucks. She might be afraid or prejudice about it. If she’s a danger to herself or others, call 9-1-1 or whatever emergency services are in your area. [info] None [info] 1510470862

I was diagnosed with bipolarism when I was in high school, but my mom is very anti-big-pharma, pro-essential-oils and the bible and she denied me meds.

hamsaurus [info] I've known my SO for the entire 10 years I've been diagnosed with bipolar.   He has seen me at my absolute worst times, and my best times.  When I say absolute worst, I mean absolute worst.  I've said and done things that I very much regret and will always feel very guilty for.  On the other hand though, he's always encouraged me to be open about my feelings, and he's helped me work through a lot of really hard times, and I know that it's okay because every time I have a good day he just looks so happy.  Happy and proud.  I never get sick of hearing him say that I'm doing well and that he can tell how hard I'm working.I sort of went off topic with that, but as much as I know he feels sad or upset when dealing with my issues, I also feel sad or upset when dealing with his.

minimommy2 [info] I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. I don't even know where to start. I can barely breathe. I keep trying to fix things and everything keeps getting worse to the point where I really don't particularly even care about being alive any more...but I have two little ones that need me. I just don't know what to do at this point and I'm tired of crying all day every day and the panic attacks.I'm 26, I'm a single parent. Currently I own a retail boutique and am finishing my degree in biology. I wanted to be a pediatrician originally but that's currently out of the running both financially, emotionally, time-wise, and just about everything else. I just took half of my finals for this semester (the rest on Thursday) and then I have one semester left (graduation would be in May). I am paying for this final year of college with student loans (with the possibility that my parents will reimburse me when I get my diploma). The problem is, that through bad business and personal decisions made while I was extremely manic (before I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder this year), I have acquired about $48,000 in debt. I managed to pay down about $5000 of that (purely credit card debt) over the summer - leaving me with $43,000. That number is so astronomically huge I don't even know where to start. My credit is bad, approximately 520, even though I've paid off all majority of the medical bills that were listed on it in 2015 - they're all marked as settled for less than full amount. I have one credit card now, with a $1500 limit, that is utilized and completely paid off by the due date, but it's only 2 months old. All other credit cards have been paid off. My student loans are deferred but currently total $5500. Derogatory marks on my credit are listed as age of accounts, number of accounts, accounts settled for less than full balance, and a lien that has been paid off (ex-husband intentionally didn't pay the taxes on the house so I would be liable as well - deed was in both of our names but mortgage was in his name only, and we had moved 6 hours away so I wasn't notified of the lien until it showed up on my credit. It's been released and I've attempted to submit the release to have it taken off, but it's still there.)  Breakdown:$32,000 to a contractor - have already paid him $20,000 of the original $52,000, have been served with papers demanding payment of the remainder.$8,000 - Title Loan taken out at the insistence of the contractor to "tide him over" until I could get a loan for the full amount I owed him, which hasn't happened due to my credit score. $3,000 - Medical bills from an abuse incident in April, the hospital forgave all of my abuser's medical bills but said I made too much for mine to be forgiven, even though he was formally charged and tried and is supposed to pay them...he hasn't. One just showed up on my credit this morning...plummeting my score 51 points.All of this wouldn't be so bad if I had any positive income coming in..but currently I'm barely breaking even with the bills as it is with the income from working at the store. I haven't paid November's rent yet, and now December's is due today. ($1000 each month). This is after I downsized our housing into the cheapest available space in our area, traded in my car for one without payments, canceled the babysitter and bring my youngest to work, and took my oldest out of private school. The store was originally making ~$20,000 a month before expenses (net profit ~$6k), my then-fiance was making ~$40k a year, and I had child support ($850/month) and royalties ($300/month). Now the store is making ~$3-4k a month, no secondary income, child support has been cut to $650/month, and royalties (oil/gas) have gone down to about $130/month. I'm desperately looking for a second job that's flexible enough for me to still be able to pick up my oldest from school as she's not old enough to be home alone and to either keep my youngest with me or pay someone to watch her. It just seems like an all around impossible situation to climb out of, and I don't know what to do. I've tried making plans and discussing them with my parents and structuring repayment plans, etc...but all of that hinges on them agreeing to be cosignors - which they refuse to do. They've been telling me to just file bankruptcy and get it over with, but I also don't want to lose everything I've built up...as little as it is. I just don't know what to do or where to turn.

KittyFace11 [info] I am 55.  I have been in several abusive relations, and in one, my new fiancé decided that my careful wrapping of Christmas presents competed with the way he wrapped the presents and,  without warning, started to beat me with his fist, until I passed out, and he left me for dead.  Abusers are all the same; they instigate an argument and no matter what you do, it escalates sharply.  You are blamed for everything, and nothing about you is acceptable.  They deliberately make you feel like shit, because they need that power to feel any identity.  *But anything an abuser tells you that you are, is not at all about you, but about themselves.*For 30 years I have had various friends with bipolar disorders:  any creative field seems to attract unique personality types.  I have met people in hospital settings with bipolar.  One of my best friends has both bipolar and borderline.  And recently I was diagnosed with bipolar—before that I had fluctuating moods but I dealt with them w/o medication, and also saw a psychiatrist.  (Extraordinary stresses pushed my body chemistry into, what I think of as, brain shock, and now I take medication to rebalance it .)My point is, out of all these people, I have never met an abusive person,  they care too much about others.  We’ve joked around that you’re bipolar because you are overstimulated, feel too much, and the empathy kills you, lol!An abusive person couldn’t give a shit.  Either your focus is on them, or you’re nothing.  You are meaningless.  I don’t think most abusive people know that true love does NOT mean true power.So, I strongly disagree that all people with BP are abusive.  I do agree that, in some mania, selfishness can be a predominant symptom, because you are just pretty much incapable of thinking clearly—you are swept away by a hurricane made up of a thousand tornadoes.Your ex, op, is an abuser.  An abuser can wear such a great mask!  So, whether he has BP or not is rather irrelevant BECAUSE *he is an asshole!*.   This is  not your fault:  darkness wears the best disguise,  You are well out of it. [info] None [info] 1543905198

knullemora666 [info] My advice to you: Get off all social media for at least 6 months minimum.I deleted Facebook 5 months ago and couldn't be happier. There are subliminal messages in all of social media. I have kept my Reddit and Instagram, but that is it. Way back in 2004 I was diagnosed with bipolar, back when the trend literally boomed. Take it with a grain of salt. I am not bipolar, I feel like they do this to just about everyone.You are young, hormonal, and won't stop changing until your old and grey.Don't let that diagnosis define you. Let you define you. Eat a balance diet, it will help balance the chemicals in your body. Start meditating for 20-30 mins in the morning. It might not make sense or 'work' at first, but give yourself time and you will find the go to zone to help you clear your mind. Use guided meditation on YouTube if needed. Do a sport or exercise that you enjoy. This will release endorphins and give your body a habit of providing endorphins to you on a regular basis. Give yourself time to heal. All that attention seeking you did in high school, not saying your experience wasn't real just you did it to get your family to notice you, affected how you look and are looked at in the world. Raise your vibration, if something makes you unhappy, angry, depressed then chances are it isn't good for you. Think positively, I know it isn't easy, but I promise you can do it. For example, I don't have a car right now, it broke down in Aug and I had to sell it. I have 5 kids, 3 being toddlers. Things might seem bleak, but that is far from the truth. We walk all the time, which has made us happy with the exercise and fresh air. We are more united as a family. We have discovered many things around our neighborhood. The best part is that I know this isn't forever. This is just a phase we had to go through.We always go through phases, changes, cycle and that is ok. It is so that we can grow. We are only human and don't have all the answers. The more you go through, the more you learn. Work on you, focus on you, give yourself time to be who you are destined to be, love yourself, and know that no matter what you will get through this. Also, hair grows back. I shaved my head bald last Sept because I was going through so much I let it get to me. I won't do it again, but now I have beautiful virgin hair. It is super soft and vibrant. I've died my hair since 1998 and don't remember my hair feeling so good.If there is a craft or hobby you like, do it. That way you always have joy close by. I wish you the best.

saladisawasteoftime [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager. I’ve been medicated for ten years and I’ve always ALWAYS taken my meds. It is so important to keep taking them even if you’re feeling better. I made the most movements towards regaining myself in the last five years when I was seeing a therapist as well. One of the things she taught me was to be kind to myself. The illness is never going to go away but it will get easier to deal with. So when it hits me hard for a week or so I remember to be kind to myself and remind myself that it’s ok that certain things can’t get done. When I’m sick I can’t do it all but I can do what’s important.  [info] None [info] 1540652164
Liz688 [info] I'm on it now and I love it.  I started on lamictal but had to go off it because it interferes with birth control (so does topamax but only at doses 200 mg or higher).  I'm on a low dose (50 mg) but seem to be one of the ones that feels better at a low level.  Personally, I've really loved it.  I feel...well, it's a little hard to describe.  Stable is the word generally used but it's a little more than that and I haven't quite found a way to put it that feels exactly right yet.  Calmer.  Less prone to being sad and upset, more able to look at things rationally.  Able to get over things quicker when they do upset me rather than being upset all day long.  Less obsessive over things that don't matter and more able to appreciate the things that do.  None of that is perfect--I still obsess over the things that don't matter more than I would like, still get angrier quicker than I would like, etc--but it's definitely a huge step up.  I did notice the side effects that most people complain about.  The foggy-headed feeling the most.  My doctor prescribed vyvanse at a low dose and that combats a lot of it.  I also take it at night so I sleep through the worst of the fatigue caused by it.  The foggy headedness and fatigue seem to be fading over time, as does the tingling/numbness.  I felt the numbness in my face and hands a lot the first few days but in the weeks after it faded and I hardly ever feel it anymore.  It also had some sexual side effects to begin with but those started fading around week 3 and are almost gone entirely now.  I hope you have a positive experience like I did.  Good luck!Edited to add: I was diagnosed with bipolar II so I don't know if that makes a difference.  Also, topamax is a heck of an appetite suppressant so if you feel bad on it, start setting reminders on your phone to eat and drink.  Drinking especially--a lot of the feeling bad may be from blood sugar crashes and dehydration.  The weight loss side effect has actually been a huge health benefit to me as I'm already very overweight and thats part of my my pdoc and I picked this particular drug to try in the first place over some of the more traditional ones that cause weight gain.

BubbleTeaRex [info] I was just talking to my bestie about this. I have been diagnosed with PTSD. She told me she had PTSD for a week after she broke her arm in Hawaii. In her mind, she is just better and stronger than other people with PTSD, and their inability to “get over it” is directly caused by their own shortcomings. I explained that what she experienced likely was post traumatic stress. But it was not a disorder. She can relate to some of the symptoms someone with PTSD might also relate to, but something that goes away on its own and does not greatly impact your ability to function normally is, by definition, not a disorder. We have been friends for over 15 years and I’ve NEVER talked about mental illness at all. I knew she wouldn’t react well to it. I was diagnosed with bipolar a couple of days ago after refusing / avoiding any kind of treatment since I was first evaluated for bipolar at age 12. I was worried she would find out and make assumptions, and I wanted to explain my experience before that happened. She told me that bipolar is caused by what you put in your body and that I shouldn’t be seeking treatment. Instead, she told me to use herbs and essential oils because those are just as effective. She’s currently in school to become a paramedic and doesn’t even believe in science based medicine... I’m worried our friendship is doomed.

possessednayru [info] Same. I was put in a psych hospital when I was like 12 or 13 for a suicide attempt. (That's when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) Hearing the cries of small children in the hallways at night... It was something else. They cried for their parents, yelling out into the hallways to the night nurse. Lots of movies with psych wards portray everyone as buddies and lifelong friendships. I listened to kids cry every night, a girl that found her mom's dead body, a boy that talked about microwaving cats. It was not fun, nobody had friends, and it was so sad.

MyNameIsRevan [info] I wouldn't consider myself as a professional(by that I mean, someone with a music degree, been paid to perform, etc.), but I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I recall being sort of addicted(?) to what other people would say. Specifically, I would question my self worth if people didn't comment on my guitar playing. This became a big problem for me especially during depressive episodes, where I wouldn't touch the instrument because I felt no progress was being made. I'm going through an episode right now, but I got a handle on it I think. I've been playing for eleven years now, though and they don't feel wasted at the moment.   [info] None [info] 1465008867
couldyouknat [info] I am a dead beat mom This is a long story and I hope you'll stick around for it all and share your opinion. I had my kids when I was 18 and 19. Their father was a drug addict and wanted nothing to do with us. The 3 of us moved across the country when ny youngest was 1 to the city I grew up and where my family was. He has never spoken to us since and has never helped financially. I met someone and he fully took on the role of their father. When my kids were 4 and 5 I was in university full time and my fiance was working out of town so I was pretty overwhelmed. Close to the end of my semester I fell apart. I ended up in the psych ward for 7 days. After being assigned a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I ended up in the hospital for another 1 week stay shortly after my first. 1 week after my second stint in the hospital my fiance went to a party, overdosed, and passed away.  Drugs were not a regular part of our lives and this was not his normal behavior. My behavior and mental state is what I believe drove him to drugs. One week after his death I surrendered my children to CPS. I had no where to live, no job, hadn't finished school, my fiance was gone and I was in the shittiest time of my life. I couldn't take care of myself and my two innocent children were about to suffer. I was given visitation while they were in foster care, but they ended up revoking it because I couldn't pull myself together and stop crying any time I saw them. They got adopted and I have had no contact since. That was 6 years ago. My daughter is almost 13 and my son is almost 12 now. They have wonderful parents and keep in contact with my mom. I try not to ask questions about them because I know it puts people in a difficult situation with what they should and shouldn't share. I feel guilty asking and I feel guilty not asking... I just found out my daughter has Instagram. I can't see anything on her page except a link she posted to tellonym. I didn't know what that was, but I guess it's an anonymous messaging app? I want to tell her I love her so bad, but I don't want to cause any more hurt for them. I've put them through the worst of the worst and I can't imagine ever being forgiven for what I've done. I'm still not, nor will I ever be 100%. I'm in therapy and doing good for myself lately and I just don't know if I should ever try to contact my children again. The guilt I live with is constant. I have asked to be sterilized. I moved 3 hours away because I was terrified I would run into their new family and they would think I was stalking them. I know what I've done is wrong. Finding her on Instagram was unexpected and wasn't intentional. She has a very unique name that she uses as a screen name and she commented on one of my mom's photos. Should I leave it alone? Should I ask my mom if they're new parents will speak with me about if they'll allow me to be in their life? Can I send her an anonymous message on this stupid app? I know I'm a shitty person and wish things had ended up different. I've been a coward and I know what I've put then through is unforgivable. Suggestions? Comments? Hate? [info] None [info] 1557298041

PintsizedPachyderm [info] I had a psychotic episode back in 2014-2015. I had been hearing vague voices for 6 months, but thought there was a very quiet broken radio in my house/car/office (and eventually became positive there were people living in my house) and didn't realise I was hallucinating until I started hearing them right next to my ear.&amp;#x200B;The scariest night was when I went to shower and hallucinated that my entire body was covered with spiders. I ran to my room, where I then saw a strange, dark and very tall figure (picture one of the Queen's guards, but all black) in the corner of the room leaning over the bed and 2 voices just behind me scream-growled "It's coming!". I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 months later, although no future hallucinations were quite so bad.

I’ve been having a really hard time with a depressive episode this month and my parents have been traveling back and forth trying to keep me stable and out of the hospital. It’s been really hard to take care of myself and my suicidal thoughts are almost constant. My schoolwork is suffering a lot as well.My parents want me to transfer to a college in my hometown and have me move back in with them so I can be taken care of and they can help me, but I am unsure of what to do.If I transferred I would be leaving my whole social life behind and I would have to have a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, who has been a big rock to me. There are lots of downsides to moving back home.

EnvyEarthworm [info] Holy.shit. SO BAD. So I have an autoimmune disease. The early symptoms were hypersomnia, and then severe insomnia, and pain. I would also turn blue. When I was a young teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was treated with zoloft, and started becoming suicidal. So they switched the meds, and I became worse. The doctor referred me to a psychiatrist and she said BPD. I ended up taking DOZENS of different drugs with no improvement. At 18, when I could legally make my own medical choices, I stopped all treatment. Funny enough, I got better. I was still in pain, and severely tired, so I went back to the doc. He saw the medical chart and said "You're fat and depressed, and that's why you're in pain." It wasn't until I moved, changed my name, and refused to show anyone my past medical chart that I was finally taken seriously. Really though, plenty of doctors used to see my chart and think that I was a drug seeker, that I just needed more mood stabilizers, or that I was (and I quote) a hypochondriac. Doctors say the most fucked up shit when they think you're crazy. The wrong diagnosis delayed a real diagnosis for years. [info] None [info] 1571244030

He helped me become a better person and start to heal. 16 Feb. 2019 I woke up and sent him a good morning message. He immediately replied with "we need to talk"...He broke up with me via Whatsapp! 2 years and he didn't have the guts to say it to my face!How I'm the crazy ex: I was reflecting on our relationship and all the memories, good and bad. I was manipulative and entitled and abusive. I now understand why he broke up with me.I was the crazy EX they warned you about! AMA [info] None [info] 1581846478
LewdDudeThrowaway [info] Sometimes they care,but reaching out can be difficult.I was diagnosed with bipolar-1 when I was 8 y/o, and struggled hard socially until I turned 17(i’m 22 now). I had one friend in elementary school and he was the only person who’d talk to me. I had family my age,but I was often ostracized.I didnt understand that people need space,I just felt lonely and wanted to be around people. So, I bugged my family and my friend to hang out constantly....long story short,my only friend and relatives my age ceased contact with me because I bugged them too much.As a kid,that fucking destroyed me. I never wanted that to happen again. My solution? If I only talk to people who talk to me first,then I **know** they actually want to be around me.Now,I have a best friend who i’ve known for about 5 years. This man redefined what friendship means to me.I had never initiated contact until he talked to me about it 2-3 years into our friendship. He asked me why,and I told him the reasons for my behavior.He told me that I should never worry about bugging him,or talking too much,or losing him because I try to hang out all the time.He ended with “I’m not going anywhere unless you get rid of me.” and it finally clicked. I cried,not gonna lie. It was the first time someone told me they were bothered that I *didnt* talk to them.Ever since then I’ve tried my best to initiate contact at least as often as he does. Just saying “good morning” or “how was work?” and stuff like that. It scares me,but I trust him more than I fear the feelings associated with my past.If you have somebody who you are genuinely close to,I recommend you do what my friend did for me. It may not have “trauma” behind it like mine did,but they may have a roadblock and need your help to get past that. [info] None [info] 1531206256
facialdilemma [info] is medication necessary? i'm diagnosed with bipolar II and i'm supposed to be taking 800 mg lithium every night. i sent a form to my GP asking for a new prescription sheet a while ago so i can pick up more from the pharmacy but apparently since i updated my address they told me i need to find a new GP closer to my apartment. so i haven't been taking the lithium for a few weeks as i haven't gotten a new prescription. but i really don't feel a difference at all compared to when i have been taking the medication. maybe i'm a bit biased bc i dont really believe medication does so much. but i just don't think it's necessary i have an appointment with my psychiatrist in the beginning of march and i think i'll ask her what she thinks. but i'm almost positive i'm gonna get a shocked reaction like "what?? you're not taking your medication?????" idk i'm just wondering if anyone else isn't taking the medication they're supposed to and feels fine or if it's a terrible idea to avoid taking it. thanks in advance :) [info] None [info] 1580913605

After four months of meeting weekly with a psychiatrist and his assistants, and the psych office communicating regularly with the transplant office, I was finally cleared to donate. (I'm almost three weeks post transplant!!!)Their concern was more about me having an episode right after the surgery, as it is a major stressor and could be triggering.

shiro321 [info] That I was insane, a murder, tortured animals/small kids/elderly, attempted suicide, a molester/rapist, a sadist and pretty much everything else you can think of about mental illness.I was  a shy kid who never had a lot of friends and always stayed to my self, I have Adhd, bipolar disorder, central auditory disorder and mild schizophrenia and have been on meds and getting treatment for it since I was 7 years old. I was the kid that had to stop by the nurses office twice a day for unknown reason(to take my meds). So this had already labeled me as a "weird kid."Near the end of my last year in middle school I spent two weeks in a mental hospital where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When I returned to school no one knew where I had been. I just told everyone that I was sick and had to stay in the hospital but one teacher decided that the official explanation from the principle was not good enough and was going to fail me for missing the two weeks and forced me to explain where I was and why in front of the whole class. This was two weeks before the year ended and kids being kids no one would speak to me, sit near me or even make eye contact with me for the rest of the year, they avoided me like I had the plague. Over those two weeks and over the course of the summer the rumors started to spread and when highschool started it was every where. The rumors followed me all through highschool and I was always treated like an outcast for it, I had a very hard time making any friends and I was bullied and ridiculed for it. This led to me becoming even more depressed and having to spend more time in the mental hospital my senior year. The school finally caved and gave me a home tutor to finish my senior year from home.

Donutsareagirlsbff [info] When I decided I needed to see a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with bipolar and she helped me see that the abusive situation in my childhood was worse than I'd ever allowed myself to believe due to guilt and shame. I took a break from my mum for six months, went through a grieving process, got my strength and told her some things I needed to say. Long story short she was sexually abused as a child and it created a chain reaction of terrible relationships. I always knew she loved me but she put me in some very dangerous situations and neglect. She took it very well, cried a lot and apologised. I love her more for the way she handled it as well.I'm still in the process of completely being in my AD. I need to talk to my father who I haven't for six or seven years but I'm much happier and more stable now. I'm also ready after a year of being with my psych to stop seeing her and manage my medication with a GP.

DennisChrDk [info] Anyone with experience taking quetiapin(seroquel)? My moody is plummeting after an increase in dosis. Short backstory: I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2, round 3 weeks ago. I had been hypomanic for 1-2 months prior to this which then turned into a mixed state. I won’t start the actual treatment until early august, due to the summer holidays. When I was diagnosed I started 50mg quetiapin every night, to improve my sleep and balance out my mood. Thursday I was told to increase the doses to 100mg, but over the weekend my mood went from neutral/good, to very depressed and my mood changes are becoming more extreme. The weekend has been hell, with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts (nothing I'm going to act on!). Today started out fine, but I can feel that its getting worse already.Is this normal or could this be a side effect of the medication (this is mentioned in the leadflet).  If so is this something that I should talk with my psychiatrist about or will it even out over the next days? Still very in this, so I’m still getting used to all of this.

Decided I needed a second opinion because I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 years ago but never went on the pill. I could never completely relate to bipolars so it always seemed odd.As soon as I gave the new psych my history, my feelings, everything, she said "first off, you are not bipolar. You have something called borderline personality disorder." She prescribed meds and asked me to meet a psychotherapist and when I met her she scheduled an appt and asked me to read about BPD.I cannot tell you how relieved I was when after 22 years, I finally understood why I was so different.

thegreenlentil [info] It's not good for her to just decide to stop taking her meds. In general I'd say that's never a good move for psych meds. She should talk to her doctor and see if she can get on different ones or change the dosage. I was diagnosed with bipolar II a year ago and I only found the right meds a couple months ago. I would suggest gently asking her about her meds and why exactly she decided to stop taking them. Emphasize your concern when talking to her, above all. See if you can convince her that it's a good idea to check with her doctor. Try not to get angry or accusatory, that will do more harm than good.

For those who aren't familiar, here's essentially what happens, in my experience:Thirty minutes prior, I get what I guess is an aura. I have this intense feeling of dread. I start to get double vision, and my vision rolls up from what I'm looking at, even I'm focusing really hard. I've had moments over the years where suddenly my vision will jerk back and forth for a second or two, but it never bothered me until I got the diagnosis. Whenever it happens, though, everyone tells me that my eyes aren't actually moving. I get this rocking feeling in my neck, the way that you feel when you're on a rollercoaster, but again, my neck isn't moving at all. I always thought that it was a muscle spasm or something but I'm not sure.I get extremely disoriented. Everything looks and feels fuzzy. My spatial awareness is shot. I start slurring and stumbling really badly, and it's hard for me to understand what people are saying or what's going on around me. At this point, I can barely ask for help.Then I get vertigo. I can only explain it by saying it feels like the worst pain I've ever experienced without any real physical pain. It's so bad that I start vomiting for hours until I dry heave. I've ripped my nails up a few times trying to ground myself, whether I'm at the toilet scratching at the floor and walls or fallen down onto the ground. If I'm able to get somewhere I can lay down on my side it's not as bad, but even barely moving any part of my body is not an option, and god forbid I move my head. It's so bad I tried rolling from one side to another for thirty minutes and woke up with the taste of vomit in my mouth. If I can't catch it before it starts, I dry-heave and scream until I pass out.Here's what I've tried:* Gotten a diagnosis, though the ENT I've gone to says it might be Meniere's disease, though I don't get tinnitus or hearing loss.* Drugs: Klonopin and Meclizine. They definitely help but they don't completely shut down the episode. I still feel disoriented for about forty five minutes but at least I'm not spinning.* An antiemetic that goes under my tongue. I've only used them once since I got the medications above, but I still hold onto them.* Lamictal, although I've taken it every day since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My doctors won't amp up my dose. I never miss a dose and I don't want to go off of it.* Wearing an eyepatch as soon as I get double vision. After a few minutes I can push it up and see if the double vision has stopped. It's a great conversation piece if I want to hit the bars but it also looks fucking stupid.* Smoking pot. This doesn't seem to help. I want so badly for the state I live in to legalize medical marijuana like those lip balms or drops on your tongue, but that won't happen any time soon.* Getting my daiths repierced. I got them a year before the migraines started and they fell out a few months ago. What's frustrating is that I'm having another mild episode and I just got them redone yesterday.* Sleeping before an episode kicks in. I wake up feeling awful but whatever works.* Weirdly, I am not extremely light or sound sensitive.Here's where I am honest:* My diet completely sucks. When they started happening more frequently, I got lost tons of weight because I felt I would just end up puking it all up. I started to see my bones through my skin and now it's become a huge psychological issue for me.* I don't actively exercise but I move around a lot at my job. I don't want to be a gym rat but I don't know if light exercise work. I am willing to try this.* I smoke cigarettes. I haven't smoked for very long but I'm heavily considering quitting.* I smoke weed fairly regularly, mostly when it's around or I'm at a party.* I drink sometimes but not often.* I think stress might be a trigger, but I have no idea how to alleviate stress in light of this.I feel so fucking trapped. I can't live like this. I have lost two jobs and a very important relationship because of this. I'm going to run out of medication soon, and I can't afford the copay. I can't figure out any specific trigger. I want a regular life. I'm 21 and I just want a regular life. I want to get a job and go to school and have a better shot at some sort of stability. People cannot see this happening to me until it goes full-force. It hurts so bad. Please, someone help me, or at least tell me they understand. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone else had this experience? Is it going to get better? Please please please someone help me. [info] None [info] 1496092303
seqtora [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder senior year of high school, and dealt with all throughout college. Trying to make friends at the same time was just a level or two above my pay grade. By the third year, I finally met someone I could hold a conversation with, but by then I'd already gotten used to pretty much being on my own.I don't really know if there's a point to saying all this. Just, even if there are a lot of things that suck about not having anyone, the inner strength you build and the things you discover about yourself can be worth it in its own right.

I don't really remember what it was like being on them, though. (I was on antipsychotics and lithium.) I also didn't cry anymore.

Trans_Trotskyist1917 [info] [TW: brief CSA discussion] I think my parents are conspiring against me??? Sorry mods if this isn't the right sub for this, I'm new to Reddit. Also please don't assume this is a joke because I'm actually really serious even though it sounds crazy. Also, this is going to be really long so I've bolded the important parts. Thanks in advance if anyone reads it.I'm 21 and my parents are in their early 60s. I live with my parents for financial reasons. My problem is that **I think my parents might be part of some kind of conspiracy** and I don't know what to do.The reason I think this is as follows: **I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 18**, but when I look back on my life and my childhood, I realize that **I showed symptoms of the disorder way before then**. I began to feel depressed and anxious as early as elementary school, and then in high school I began showing symptoms of mania and delusional thinking. As an example of my delusional thinking, when I was 14 I became convinced that it was my destiny to die in a jihadist holy war even though my family is not religious at all. I was open about this with my parents and was so passionate about it that I sometimes even got involved in physical fights with my father when he disagreed with me. (I am in no way saying that I think all Muslims are delusional-- I do NOT think that, so please don't hate.)Here's the real problem-- **my parents are both mental health professionals** (dad has a PhD in Psychology and runs his own private counseling practice, mom has a Master's of Social Work and practices in a mental health clinic). So, it stands to reason that since they have over 12 years of training and 50 years of experience between them in identifying and treating mental health issues, they should have been able to recognize the obvious mental health issues I was experiencing since early childhood? But **they didn't seem to recognize any of my symptoms**. They never took me to a doctor or a therapist of any kind, and after I was finally diagnosed they adamantly denied that I was bipolar.**I think they know more than they're letting on.** Another reason I think this is because my younger sister (age 19) was sexually abused by our babysitter when we were very young, and although she displayed obvious symptoms of sexual abuse throughout our childhood, my parents never acknowledged it in any way. This is in spite of the fact that as part of their mental health training, they would have received training on how to identify signs of sexual abuse in children. Also, my older brother (age 30) has autism and is prone to violent rages, which my parents also deny. They frequently say things like, "that's not how I remember it," or "you're making that up." My question is, **why would they deny my experiences if they weren't covering something up?** I can't help but assume the worst, e.g. maybe they are on the run from the law, or I'm not their real son, or something like that.**tl;dr my parents' behavior towards me is inconsistent with their extensive training/experience in a relevant field, I suspect a conspiracy of some kind. What should I do? How do I find out what they know?** [info] None [info] 1538522767

Haybaybay2792 [info] Tl;dr at the end, my personal experience here.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 18 and after 7 years of a working diagnosis of BPD, my amazing pdoc gave me the comorid dx of both. Her primary reason was that she has seen me through both types of episodes, stable from bipolar with meds so then she could she the short live volitialy, identity issues, and relationship struggles. Then after an embarrassingly long time of DBT skills training, when I stablized from that and had a situational/medical manic episode i recongized early but used so many skills and called her right away to get through to my emergency appointment, she gave me the comorid diagnosis.Tl;dr it takes years of a relationship with a pdoc and working to get better and trying things out to get a proper dx of either or both [info] None [info] 1564241207

Ktrenal [info] No problem. Happy to help. :)The sneaky thing about the hypomanic phases is that sometimes it just seems like "not depressed". The milder forms of bipolar are so much harder to diagnose than the ones with full manic episodes, with the hallucinations and delusions. Hypomania can also just be irritability, instead of the typical euphoria, too. So it's sneaky!For me there were two very distinct signs that I wasn't "just" depressed: my tendency to start writing a novel a couple times a year, which I'd work on intensely for a couple of weeks, and then abandon when the hypomanic episode ended, and the way I reacted to antidepressants. The fact that I'd tried so many different antidepressants, all of which either made me more depressed or made me manic, was definitely under consideration when I was diagnosed with bipolar.Totally agreed with f.lux is the best thing ever!

miss-septimus [info] I don't mean to sound as if I'm excusing my behavior entirely, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II and OCD. One of the symptoms which make it difficult for me not to try and buy anything for skin care is hypomania (and also, the hoarding with my OCD). One of the minor things which occurs is impulsive buying (and consequently, hoarding) skin care products. For instance, this week, I bought a Mamonde toner, the Mizon watery cream jumbo jar, CosRX patches, and a sonic brush. Two weeks ago, I bought Niacinamide from The Ordinary and the CosRX Gentle Salicylic Wash. What helps me, apart from therapy and medication, of course, is to constantly ask myself why I do this. I noticed that I only use 70% of what I buy. The rest just makes me feel 'safe.' I also write down every monetary transaction that I make, and remind myself that I've been making progress since being diagnosed six years ago. [info] 26 | Oily/Acne-prone | NC30 [info] 1523130208

yesihaveshatmyself [info] Hey OP. First off, I have so much respect for you. You’re fighting for your partnership while balancing that with your own self care and that’s hard and amazing and important.I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD a decade ago. I’ve been a real mess throughout my adult life, and to be honest I still am. And almost as bad as, maybe worse than, my own struggle is seeing the toll it takes on my husband. He’s been dealing with my shit for going on 9 years now and I don’t know how he does it. For all the times I’ve nearly called it quits on my own life, I’m in awe of his ability to not call it quits on the life we share together.I don’t know what kind of person your partner is, but I know from personal experience that when my husband takes time for himself, sets boundaries, airs his grievances, and keeps me in the loop with how my illness affects him I am grateful and humbled. It’s hard to deal with how your sickness effects those you love, but a million times harder when you know that it’s *not* being dealt with at all. Over the years, my husband has taken steps to take better care of himself, and that in turn has had a wonderful effect on our marriage.I’m rooting for you two so hard. I know how much of a struggle it is. But take my advice as a person on the other end: do not set yourself on fire to keep your partner warm. It will burn the both of you. Don’t fall into a caretaker role, it’s hard to dig yourself out of that and it will only hurt both of you. Make your own space and make your needs known. Mental illness is an explanation for behavior but it is never an excuse. He must be accountable just as you must be supportive. I wish you both the very best of luck. [info] None [info] 1538781444

bluehurr [info] Me [26F] with my best friend [27F] found and browsed my Reddit despite promising not to. I feel violated- am I making a big deal? Hey Reddit,Just some background. I've known Jane (fake names) for 6 years. We are more like sisters than friends, we support each other and trust each other whole heartedly. I was diagnosed with bipolar last year, and amongst my support group, Reddit has been a great support network. I am active on mental illness subreddits and submit a lot. I've always been paranoid that someone will read through my comments (it's like reading through my diary) but both Jane and my partner know how much the Reddit community and account privacy mean to me. They have both assured and promised me that even if they found my account, they wouldn't look into it. Jane at the moment is out of state. We used her computer to stream some shows (she lets us). When I went to shut it all down and delete our browser history, I saw my reddit username all through her previous searches. She had actively looked up my account (no idea how she came across it, she must have looked when I was on my phone or laptop at some point) and read through some of my personal comments. I stopped looking when I saw this, as I myself didn't want to snoop the same way she had and invade her privacy. I'm really hurt and feel as though I can't really trust her. She knew how personal and important my account was to me, and how much it helps me with my mental illness. I've deleted all my comments on my account and this is a throwaway. The subs I browsed were my safe place and I no longer feel like I have that luxury. I don't want to confront Jane, she tends to lie when confronted and I can't be bothered with the bullshit. I'm thinking of just really not confiding in her with personal matters anymore- am I making a big deal about it all? What should I do? TDLR: Friend found my private and personal Reddit account after promising not to. Actively searched and read through my comments, which included intimate things about my mental illness.

thelittlegnome [info] Tapering off Lamictal - what was it like for you? About 7 years ago, when I was 19, I was diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder very quickly by my primary care doctor. I was at a really dark time in my life and needed help so I didn’t think much about my diagnosis just that I needed something. I was prescribed lamictal and have been taking 200mg every day since.     Fast forward now, I’m 26, I’m engaged, have a career I love, and everything feels relatively stable. I’ve been debating for over a year now that everything has settled and I’m in a routine, whether or not my diagnosis was correct. I started seeing a new psychiatrist and shared my concerns with him - that I’m a completely different person now than I was when I was diagnosed as a teenager. I don’t remember what I’m like without that medicine and that kinda scares me. After much discussion, we decided to taper off of the medication.  He gave me a schedule but told me to make it flexible and to listen to my body and how it’s reacting. I was to reduce my dosage by 50mg every 1-2 weeks.   I started tapering down to 150mg on Tuesday 5/7. On Thursday 5/17 I felt ready to taper down to 100mg. And that’s where I’m at now. I feel like I’m moving really slow on tapering but since I’m not sure what I’m like without the medicine, that’s what I feel comfortable doing. I’ve noticed increasingly in the past few days that I just have zero patience. I’m really on edge and feel fed up all the time with the people around me. I just feel so confused about this whole process.    All that being said (sorry for rambling) what was your experience like tapering off? [info] None [info] 1526882848
bluedolphin4 [info] I guess I didn't consider this, I do often find myself swinging between two different phases.  There are times when I am full of unbounded confidence and feel I am capable of accomplishing whatever I set my mind to.  It almost like I feel invincible.  When I feel this way, I generally have the urge to party alot.  Then there are other times when I consider myself worthless; just another piece of flesh on this planet who falsely thinks he has everything figured out.  During this phase, I tend to not want to go out much and prefer to stay in my room.  Guess it makes sense that I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Aside from this, I also was physically abused when I was younger, so that might've had some sort of long-term impact on me.  However, I do believe I am good at hiding this part of me, it's only in more serious relationships that these traits tend to reveal themselves.

At 18 I get a girlfriend and we are dating for almost 4 months (at the time) so I tell my parents (bc I met her parents and I felt that she should meet mine), At first they seemed supportive, but as time went on homophobic jokes didn’t stop and I got outed to several homophobic family members who I wasn’t going to tell. It sucks to have this negativity and lack of support, but if you are able to move out do so. Find your own family full of supportive friends and you will be happier. [info] None [info] 1557839900

Lanuria [info] The Jedi have emotions. To think they don't is silly. They are human(oid) and, imo, they feel so much love that it's ridiculous. Maybe it's not a romantic or sexual love, but being able to put yourself in the middle of a fight to save people who may not even believe you exist is an act of love. To resist a tempting power so you don't hurt anyone is an act of love. Personal story time! I'm diagnosed with bipolar, so strong emotions have ruled my life for a long time. They have ruined relationships with friends and family. They have lead me dangerously close to suicide. They ruled me, they controlled me. It was so freeing to finally get on medications and not have my manics and depressive control how I thought. Sure, maniacs are kinda fun, but they are dangerous in the long run. It was liberating to finally be in control of what controlled me. I am able to hold down a great job, to have a great relationship with my husband, to find peace in my life. I still have manic or depressive episodes, it's normal. But I've learned they don't define me. I'm better than them. That's how I see the Jedi way of life. I can take my manics and do something good with them, like sewing, but I can also tell myself 'no, I don't need to buy a new sewing machine, no, I need to sleep, I'm not going to stay up forever.' The Jedi are like that. Manics aren't really an example of the dark side, but maybe they are a good example of what a force sensitive could go through. So much power, you can do so much, but if you let it control you instead of working with it, you can end up hurting yourself and others.  [info]  [info] 1476979819

JessierysTargaryen [info] Battling Bipolar II &amp; Genetic Disease Hi guys,A few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, a year or two after that, after years of misdiagnosis, I was diagnosed with Hydradenitis Supprativa. For bipolar disorder: I tried medication, talking to a psychologist and coping mechanisms. Nothing worked for me, except exercise. I love playing sports or working out, it feels great ... there's only one downside... My HS.Hydradenitis Supprativa is a genetic autoimmune disorder that's currently incurable despite it being around for centuries. I tried medication, laser hair removal, oral antibiotics, no shaving, eventually figuring out that my disease has flare ups when I have dairy. It's harder to avoid than most people think. Eating out and foods that aren't raw always have some sort of dairy I need to watch out for. Powders, whey, cream, milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese, etc. Anyway, sometimes some miniscule dairy slips into my body and I end up with a lump(s) on my groin. This makes exercise impossible because of the pain; usually takes 6 weeks for the swelling to go down or I end up with surgery without anesthesia (30 mins is not long enough to put me under according to the anesthesiologist). Not being able to exercise is worsening my bipolar II, because it's the only coping mechanism that works for me. Those surgeries also have a strong impact on my mental sanity, it's like I lose a little piece of myself and my hopes and dreams seem insignificant and I wonder why continue on. I don't know where I'm going with this post honestly... I'm just hoping that I'm not alone... Hoping there will be a cure in my lifetime. Maybe I'm not the only one out there fighting a battle on two fronts. I know I could have it worse, but it's hard to be grateful when I'm suffering. Is anyone else in a similar situation?

courtney10 [info] I am 5'10" and I weight 180 lbs right now.  I hate the way I look, I feel undatable, unlovable, ashamed, uncomfortable in my own skin, out of shape, and angry at myself for letting my weight get out of control.  I usually weight 135 - 145 lbs, and I look great at that weight.  But I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently, and while things were a crazy rollercoaster of extreme moods and bad behavior, I developed a drinking problem and started binge eating and gained about 50 lbs in 8 months.  Things are back under control now, but I'm covered in stretch marks from the rapid weight gain and I still have 40-50 lbs to loose to feel good about myself again.I got out of a four year relationship a couple of months ago, and I want to start dating soon, but I feel like until I loose all of the weight I gained and let my stretch marks fade, I think I'll be too disgusted by my own body to let anyone see me naked.

lukesgaming [info] I don't understand the hate for meds. MEDS ARE FANTASTIC. JUST FIND THE RIGHT KIND.The definition of meds is trial and error. I had bad reactions to um, 5 different meds before I found the right kind. Including not being able to swallow, hallucinating, having potentially life threatening heart problems, and lack of appetite, to name a few. But none of that really mattered once I found good meds. They never made me feel less like myself as far as I can remember, only less suicidal all the time, which was good in my book.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I went off my meds awhile ago and haven't felt the need to take them anymore.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost two years ago."My mother: "Well I just don't see it."Me: "And that is why you are not a psychiatrist."I don't know which is more frustrating, that I told my dad I had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was taking medication for it a couple of months after the diagnosis (my parents are still together; I assumed he told her), or that she's been doing the same thing my entire life (I also have ADHD and I told her I had an attention problem when I was 12 and she wouldn't even consider the possibility; having the diagnosis would have helped me a TON in middle school because I had a bunch of behavioral problems).

g_netic [info] I'm late to the party, but..My mother had me diagnosed with ADD when I was 3 and I was put on ritalin from then on. Then in grade 7 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began taking all kinds of drugs. I always felt very sad and suicidal, on auto pilot all the time. In grade 10, I figured if I had never, ever felt good on pills then maybe they were the problem. Long story short, my mother agreed to let me go off all of my meds except for ritalin. It was like an enormous cloud drifted away from above me. I never felt intense feelings like that ever again. I eventually went off of my ritalin as well and ended up excelling in college and now university.

Kimberlite_1223 [info] I can relate so much to your story. I was diagnosed with bipolar and from day 1 I did not have any of my family members’ support. When I was 18, I attempted to commit suicide and I was sent to the ER - then the mental ward. While I was at the ER, my mother called me and told me to get out of the hospital because the family couldn’t afford it. She was yelling at me angrily, completely ignored the fact that her daughter fell mentally ill and attempted to commit suicide. Both my parents refused to believe that I was struggling and I was completely on my own. Similar to you, I always really wish that I had their support, but I never received the kind of love I desire. Indeed it was our parents who are responsible for not raising us with the appropriate care and support, but it is our own responsibility to take care of our own emotions. I suggest to seek help from psychotherapy, as I am trying to do right now. Stay distance from your parents because sometimes distance will help. All the best! [info] None [info] 1561743672

Babygirlshy94 [info] Depressed and confused I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15 years old. I've missed so many days of high school, but managed to get myself into a program my school had and was able to graduate. After high school I started working full time at Wendy's for five months (June - November). They would sometimes have me working 15 hours a day when I was scheduled to work an 8hour shift. Then when I tried to call in sick because I was feeling really depressed (3hours before my shift) they would just straight out tell me that they have no one else and I can't call in sick. They did that every time. I wound up quitting. A month after I quit Wendy's, I went to my hair dresser and my hair dresser suggested a trade school literally a few blocks away from my house for cosmetology school. It seemed like an easy pass to getting a career in no time. That same day I registered myself into that school. For the first two months I was there every day and did my best. I haven't been in school for a little over a month now but I have been in and out of school showing them doctor notes from my regular doctor. I just feel so depressed and I've noticed that it affects everything, work and school. I don't even want to go out anymore. The beginning of this year I thought what was making me so depressed was that I was lonely, but I met my wonderful boyfriend (Varom) this year who literally lost everything he had in a hurricane last year during sandy. He's been so wonderful to me, and even though he is really a great guy I just kept feeling depressed.Ever since I was younger I've wanted to be in the hospital so I didn't have to go to school or deal with life. After my boyfriend and my brother and myself went to the gym, a week later I went to my doctor because I felt pain. He made me go to a surgeon for an evaluation  to find out that I had a hernia in my right side that had t be surgically removed. I went to get the surgery done on June 6, and am still in some pain but not as much pain as I was. I'm screwing up everything in my life and I fear ill never be able to hold a job.Therapy doesn't help me. I've tried different medications and I've had bad experiences, some worse than others. I need advice on how to control my life or jobs I can do from home. When I start something new, I stay with it for the first few months then I just stop. I can't control it and I try, but sometime I just feel helpless. Has anyone been through anything similar? [info] None [info] 1371000285

zesty_mordent [info] Penance for my mistakes Things have ended between me and my now ex-lover. We came together at the worst time of my life right when my dad passed away (I was there to witness it to make things worse). Things were confusing between us and we didn’t know how to go about our growing intimacy. I was lost, vulnerable, uncertain, and just dead inside from my dad’s passing. Shortly after, my mom lost the house out of nowhere, and my dad’s business went under soon thereafter. It was a lot to take and it broke me even more, all the while trying to figure out my feelings about everything, including her. We stayed intimate but agreed to tel each other if we were thinking of talking to other people. This is where I fucked up. I drifted in my lonesome state and fell under the spell of multiple women who showed me kindness and I ended up becoming close to them. My lover found out and was furious, but ultimately decided to try something with me again but for real this time. I stopped talking to anyone else, verbally and spiritually committed to her and began seeking help (therapy and support groups). I even started taking meds after I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD. This was all because I knew I had a problem and wanted to better myself in order to be a good partner for her. Fast forward a year and she is unhappy with me again, this time because I didn’t literally tell everyone in the world about our relationship. I was never an open person in that regard, and even kept my dad’s death to myself for a long while before telling my closest friends. She knew this about me but still wouldn’t accept it. I tried my hardest to be more open with my friends, and began telling more people. It just wasn’t quick enough for her and one day she just gave up. Now she’s figuring things out for herself and whether or not she even wants a relationship with me again. I miss her so, and having to just be patient is killing me. I know I made mistakes, but deep down I’m a good person who just wants a true love, and maybe a family one day. I hope that my past doesn’t come back to ruin my future for I truly love this woman.

carnivorous-Vagina [info] This isn't an attack on anyone and I I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I am speaking from experience. One of the biggest things you can do is stop feeling sorry for yourself. I know that sounds harsh or simplistic but that's a huge step and usually step number one. Because you're not going to get anything solved you're not going to get out of bed you're not going to do anything if you keep thinking the card is stacked against you and you're constantly feeling but that other people should feel sorry for you as well. Whenever I start getting angry and upset and hurt and not want to do anything a lot of the time it's because I feel like what's the point the world is against me so on and so on and a lot of it is sympathy for myself so I have to start thinking differently than that and it helps out majorly.

You're not bad for "being a mess" or being less successful than your friends. You're not a failure. You are a person and life happens. Don't try and measure your success to others, it will only bring you down. You still have time to get your life where you want it to be. It may be a little harder for you, but don't assume everyone has their shit together (because honestly I know grown ass men with great degrees drinking their lives away and not really caring.)As for feeling you're in a slump, all I can say to that is personally I have found if you really work towards managing your mental health it becomes easier. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 and I had a very (very) hard time accepting it. It will never go away but if I put the stigma of mental illness to the side I've realized its easier to focus on getting better.You aren't alone.

Psychological_Bake [info] What could my SO [30M] and I [30F] expect out of couples counseling? We're not married, but we've been living together for 6 years.  The last few years have been very strained, to say the least.  I recently found out that he's been having emotional affairs via Facebook.  As much as that breaks my heart, part of me doesn't even blame him because neither of our emotional needs have been met within our relationship for a long time, and we're both to blame for that.  I knew things were wrong, I suspected that he was cheating on me, and I just didn't do anything about it because ignoring it was easier.I want us to move past this and learn to be happy together again, but I'm almost certain that we'd end up getting complacent and falling back into old patterns if we don't get outside help.  If things don't change, I can't stay anymore.   We both deserve better than we've given each other.  I feel like the last few years have stripped me of everything but my own misery, and if *we* can't change together, then I'm going to have to change on my own.  So I'm looking into both couples counseling and individual therapy for myself.As far as he knows right now, I'm just planning on leaving.  I haven't brought up the possibility of counseling yet because I'd like to have an actual plan to pitch and a list of therapists for us to choose from. I'd also like to have a better understanding of what this would entail before I try to get us to commit to it as a couple.  I'm somewhat familiar with therapy as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen, but couples therapy is completely foreign to me.

ogrethebuffoon [info] Would you like to be interviewed about being bipolar? (from a fellow bipolar) I'm a bit of an entrepreneur and I'd like to see if there's anything I can do to build a service for other people with bipolar disorder. I should mention that I'm certainly no professional therapist. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder roughly five years ago.I would like to get the perspectives of a number of different people, so I thought I'd ask here! I'd love to have some more personal conversations via PM or even skype, but for now I'll just pose a few of the top questions I had in mind:1) What, apart from medication, do you feel contributes most to your successful managing of symptoms?2) Do you consider yourself a bipolar 'success story'? If so, why? And how did you realize you were successful?3) What are some things you wish were different about therapy?Thanks! [info] None [info] 1371613369
guilty_by_design [info] &gt;That just means weight loss is hard, but not uncontrollable.This is 100% true. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that made it *very* easy to put on weight fast, as well as cruelly increasing my hunger at the same time. In a matter of months, I went from 180lb to 225lb.For a while I felt sorry for myself. Even the doctor seemed to think that permenent weight gain was inevitable. "What's more important? Controlling your mental illness or being slim?". I gave up. I was disgusted by what I saw in the mirror, but I felt powerless to change it.Then, on a month-long visit back to England to see my mum, she scolded me for giving up so easily and getting fat and lazy. She went shopping with me to help me buy healthy but filling foods, encouraged me to walk 3 miles with her almost every day, and made me cups of fruit tea to control the hunger pangs when I felt like snacking. When the month was over, I had dropped from 225lb to 213lb. I felt incredible.When I got back to the States, I continued. I joined a gym, signed up for a free Weight Watchers membership courtesy of my insurance provider, and went shopping just like I did with my mum. I made it down to 205lb so far, shaking 20lb off my pre-mum-visit weight and almost half way back to my pre-weight-gain start point.It's hard. I've plateaued a few times, and even gained back a couple of pounds when I've let myself slip (e.g. after I had gallbladder surgery recently and couldn't exercise for a while in combination with being able to enjoy any food I wanted without gastric distress!), but when I see it, I remember my mum's firm but loving scolding and I get back on the wagon.I've had the same fight with drink. As an alcoholic - a coping mechanism for the bipolar - it's *incredibly* hard for me to quit drinking. I managed to go dry for 18 months, then fucked it all up in one night by drinking a half bottle of absinthe in one sitting. Is it not my fault? Is it 'out of my control' because I have an addiction?Of course not. The fact that something is *difficult* doesn't mean that it's *impossible*. Being fat isn't more okay for me because it's hard for me to lose weight. It's still a problem that has to be addressed. And having people say "It's okay that you're fat" doesn't help at all. It made me complacent before. It made me give up. And probably contributed majorly to the gallbladder issue I later had. Next time it could be worse. Don't enable fat people. Support and encourage them if they want it, leave them alone if they don't. But enabling them just helps them to keep hurting themselves. [info] 20lb [info] 1464294214

itsyoungt [info] How many of you discovered you were bipolar after being on an antidepressant? I was diagnosed with bipolar I after being on citalopram (an SSRI) for a year. When I was manic I actually upped my dosage per my doctor's suggestion because he thought it would help me sleep. It was such a severe manic episode that I physically could not fall asleep and went over 72 hours without rest. I was administered ativan in the hospital to help me sleep. Best sleep I've ever had. [info] None [info] 1506540167
FriendVriendin [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder while in law school. By incredible coincidence, my boss *also* had bipolar disorder. Now I was his only employee, so he was very reliant on me getting my job done. My sleep schedule was completely out of whack, and he let me do a lot of my work whenever I simply could. If I was up all night, I'd work all night and he'd understand that I had to come in after lunch the next day. He wrote many "memos" for me detailing his experience and giving advice on how to survive in a competitive, stressful, unaccepting profession. During this time I had a hospitalization brought on by lack of sleep and improper meds. Some years later, I had to disclose this on my bar application. It triggered a denial and appeal, and he went to the mat BIG TIME for me in front of the bar association. I was able to sit for the bar. I'll never forget how he "outed" himself as bipolar in the process. He legitimately could've lost clients or colleagues by "coming out," but he did it after 30 years of secrecy to show me that I can be a good attorney regardless of my condition.Edit: I take meds and adjusted to a healthy lifestyle. You *cannot* be a good attorney for your clients unless you comply with doctor's orders and make healthy changes. [info] None [info] 1471120302

induslink [info] Thank you for your response, always appreciate when somebody replied in detail. You have given me a lot to work with, can you suggest a good read?To expand on my issue ...I've had various situations, really complex situations, which I have handled really well in past, on my own, but for some reason I have a negative bias programmed in me.  I'm more likely to believe the inner critic. If I make some progress it doesn't last,  so my personality keeps changing to extremes,  from easy going extrovert who can go as far manipulating complex situations in his favor to this ball of fear who is mortally afraid of people and confrontation.  Because of this drastic change in personalities in past I was diagnosed with bipolar,  but it is definitely cptsd.  With me it's a very delicate balance which works when everything is balanced,  but the inner critic is constantly trying to gain power,  if only somehow I could be more charitable towards myself.  Though it's very hard,  as I had an extremely strict upbringing,  complete with physical,  emotional and sexual abuse ... It's very hard to beat that inner programming to gain control in tough situations.  I swing from being the most resourceful dependable intuitive person to suicidal over literally nothing,  an imaginary threat.  [info] None [info] 1501789314

nutellacrepe10 [info] Therapy? I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a year ago and while my psychiatrist suggested I do therapy, I never did. I don't talk much and I'm very introverted so therapy would just be weird and awkward for me. I never know what to say and things like that so doing therapy seems impossible to me. I did a couple of sessions and then just bounced. What i'd like to know though is how therapy goes for you guys. Like how is a normal session, what do you talk about? do you converse or is it mostly you talking? I have no idea since the sessions I took were generally just background. I was supposed to "start" my therapy the session after that but I never went. so I'm just wondering how therapy is, what a normal session is like, etc. [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1451953690
valentine-evenings [info] Switching from the pill. What are my options? I'm 27 years old and I've never been pregnant. I've stayed on the pill for years and I'm kind of over it. I want something with higher effective rate and longer term. I would go straight for an IUD, but I have a uterine malformation called unicornuate uterus. I'm unable to get an IUD because my uterus is the wrong shape and too small.I've tried NuvaRing (intense anger, mood swings. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and this makes me hypomanic) and Nexplanon (bleeding for 6 months straight) as well. I did have great luck with Depo Provera, so I am considering this. I'm also thinking about trying Nexplanon again, is it likely that I would have the same issues with bleeding? Are there any options I haven't considered?

JE_Jack [info] too redpilled to care anymore. how do I get motivation back? I think I've swallowed too many redpills and now have no motivation to chase girls in any way. The ladies here (NZ) are also not attractive at all - it's a fat and slutty nation. Add in STD's, pregnancy risk/child support, hypergamy, AWALT, false rape accusations.... Why the fuck bother with all that risk, as well as all the emotional drama and shit testing bullshit? For what... some sex and company with someone who will probably just leave me for someone with higher SMV, and never loved me for who I am in the first place? I guess I've been infected with a MGTOW mindset far too young (22) before experiencing the world for myself. Sex has been basically handed to me in the past, too easy, and disappointing honestly. But now I'm on a long dry streak because I burned bridges and never bothered to try and get laid again.I don't feel like doing anything at all. It feels like I have to force myself even to do basic shit. All I have been doing this year is lifting and fapping, gaming and sleeping. I keep trying to quit the porn, masturbation and gaming but keep relapsing... I know I should also be studying and developing skills for a career but I just don't seem to care enough. I also have no idea how to make and keep proper friends.Just bored of life. I do nothing yet it's exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I'm diagnosed with bipolar I and now that I look back I've actually always been like this since i started PMO and video game addiction. The opposite of addiction is connection, right? Well I can't seem to connect to anyone or anything, I have no friends, close family, or passions. If I didn't exist nothing would change, it's like nothing matters to me and I don't matter at all.I really want to live a better life because I'm sick of this. But it's just so frustrating not having any energy to start taking action and seriously making improvements. If it matters, I think I have a solid baseline to work with, being white, tall (6"2), handsome (girls have ALWAYS crushed on me), fit (with a bit lower bf% I'd have the brad pitt in fight club body), and smart (\~130 IQ). Apart from all that it's like I'm starting from scratch in every other area - shitty social skills, no game, no job experience etc. [info] None [info] 1557578135
gracelovelacecb [info] This is such a long shot, but does anyone wanna interview me for their podcast? I want to become a better public speaker. I’ve had my fair share of unique experiences and professional success. I am speaking at a conference in a couple months, and I am fucking terrified. I get anxious when I order food over the phone. I’ve been deliberately throwing myself outside of my comfort zone to become more comfortable with public speaking. Here are a few experiences that people could be interested in hearing about: - My family lost a young child in a school shooting. For years, we have done everything we can to promote reasonable and effective gun control legislation. This eventually turned into a nonprofit organization that operates in dozens of states. I’ve had the opportunity to eat and speak with prominent gun control advocates including Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Gabby Giffords. - My father is a twice-convicted bank robber. He was notorious for being “polite,” and he always said please, thank you, and sorry to the bank tellers. I grew up with sketchy vans outside my home and often stumbled upon wads of cash stashed in random places. We ate Thanksgiving dinners in prison and heard suspicious clicks on the landline telephone. It was like we were living in The Godfather or something. He is currently serving his  22nd year of his 23 year sentence. - Like my father, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I spent months in an inpatient psychiatric facility after I lost my shit. I experienced some fascinating delusions and hallucinations. Ex: I believed I was the subject of a science experiment, and my whole world was just a set inside of some research laboratory. Sometimes I experienced tactile hallucinations that felt like there were bugs crawling inside of my body. It was all pretty funky and weird. I am mostly better now. I have a very solid routine and plan that keeps my noggin in check. Medication, sleep hygiene, journal entries, etc. I am especially interested in sharing this story because I think it could be useful to people with mental health issues. I was suicidal and incapable of living on my own for a good chunk of my late teens, but I am healthy now. I’ve gotta lotta good tips and tricks under my belt for dealing with a fucked up brain. - I had a short-lived but successful career as a webcam model. I was making ~$300/hour at eighteen years old and accumulated a following of 100k+ in just a few months. I’m not even that cute — I just had a hidden talent for marketing. I have a lot of weird, funny, shocking, and certainly NSFW stories from this stage of my life. - I gave “sugar dating” a shot and fell in love with my “sugar daddy.” I’m now in an open relationship with a wildly successful man twice my age. It’s like living in a fantasy world with Lamborghinis, private jets, and strippers. Surprisingly, I would love to share this story and hopefully lighten up some stigma surrounding age gap relationships and sugar dating. He has been a tremendously positive influence on my life, and I owe a lot of personal and professional development to this lifestyle. And a lot of fun. - I was raped by three of my male “friends.” I felt devastated and discouraged after filing a police report , so I took it upon myself to record a confession from one of my attackers. I was successful after weeks of researching recording consent laws, writing a script, rehearsing my lines, and finding a way to get in the same room as my attacker. This story is still unfolding, but I would be glad to share my story of healing knowing that I could  spark some hope in other sexual assault survivors. I don’t want it to seem like I think my life is exciting or inspirational and must be heard.  I just wanna get comfortable speaking into a microphone before I have to do it in front of a live audience. Thanks y’all! [info] None [info] 1549252877

utternewb [info] [NF]Unhappy “Philosophers of happiness tend to agree, if on nothing else, on the difficulty of defining happiness.” I think happiness is how we choose to react to life. Happiness is a spectrum; there is no black and white. I mean how can there be when the world is full of so much grey? At the same time, happiness isn’t a constant. It’s an ever changing, jumbled mess of a thing. It's like the tide always rising and falling. Now I’m not exactly sure what this is supposed to be about. I could write about Beethoven, Van Gogh, Mozart, a plethora of other great meaningful and accomplished people who were miserable for most of their lives. But they’re all long dead and their stories have been told. I’m going to write about me, because my story is still young. I may not have accomplished anything as recognizable as them. But my story is still being written.I grew up in a poor family in a backwoods town. My family was pretty trashy and looked down upon by everyone else in the town I grew up in. My parents each worked twelve plus hour days just to make ends meet for our family of seven. So it's already not the ideal starting place for someone to be happy. I was poor, almost never saw my parents, and when I did they were tired and overworked. Another thing on top of it, my parents were from a different generation compared to others in my age group. So my parents had rather… let's say harsh discipline practices. By harsh I mean my dad was the type of father, who if you “back talked” him, would give you the “switch”. But I felt he loved me fine enough, it was my mother that was the real nightmare. I still have scars from her curling iron. Wow this got dark quick. It’s okay though because this story ends up a lot better than you would actually think. I eventually went through puberty and for some odd reason turned into a middle linebacker. At the same time they also had some health crises. So the way things were going changed. Maybe it was the health situations, maybe it was my growth spurt, but what I think it actually was; is the fact that I may be “crazy.”At 14 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with a displacement of aggression and schizophrenic tendencies. (after talking to a mental health professional recently, he feels I may have been misdiagnosed.) It’s also around this time I start to notice a considerable gap in my intelligence level compared to my peers. I was still an immature teenaged boy. But I could look at a math problem and tell you the answer by the time you started to press pen to paper to puzzle it out. Combined with the whole linebacker build thing (I went out for football and was immediately playing Varsity) I developed a little bit of arrogance. As well as a deep cynical side, because I held this romanticization of how I thought life should go. But life was not going the way I imagined. Needless to say, I didn’t think I could be happy.Fast forward four years, I have pissed away a bunch of life opportunities. I was built to play football, didn’t get any scholarships. I may have been a genius, didn’t get any scholarships. Didn’t even get accepted to any schools to be honest (my grades were garbage). However, I discovered Judo/Ju Jitsu and absolutely fell in love. When I started, I signed up to learn to hurt people. I was angry all the time. I felt like I was robbed of so much because of the hand I was dealt. I wanted to be able to teach a lesson to anyone who I felt wronged me. But Judo taught me so much about myself. I learned that even if you get a raw deal, you can always flip the cards and play it to your advantage. Also we are each responsible for our actions and where we are. Yeah some event might have happened that put you down a path, but it is you who decides whether or not you continue down that path. These weren’t the only things I took away from the experience. I also learned discipline, honor, focus, and resolve.I decided to open communication with my parents again. I didn’t feel like they were the best parents, but they were my parents and they helped shape me into who I was at that point. I came “home” to see them. Found out my dad’s health had gotten considerably worse. I decided to move back home and help take care of him. Even though my parents treated me the way they did, they were my parents and my dad was in pain. I could see it, I felt it. My dad passed 8 months later. We went on a fishing trip, he insisted he was fine to go. Got the okay from the doctor. So we went. Got there on a Friday night, planned on staying until Tuesday. It was Memorial day weekend. My dad went to the camper at 10, “Love ya peen!” he yelled to me when he left. At midnight I finally came to the camper, my dad was face down in the bathroom. I guess he had probably been there for hours. I was told later he was cold to the touch, I was way to emotional to notice. I cried almost non stop until funeral. I was devastated. But despite him being taken from me when I was so young still, and despite the way he raised me. I loved my dad, when I came home to take care of him I saw how much he loved me. How proud he was of me. How much potential he saw in me. I remember a quote to this day he used to say to me, and I’ve only recently realized what he meant by it. But when I was still a teen and I did something, trying my best, but would still fall short. He would say to me “then you pretend you’re somebody better and do their best.” He didn’t say it to discount what I was capable of. He said it because he know I was more and that I needed to realize it. I tell myself this regularly now whenever I feel I fall short.Because to me, I’m not living a life to be happy. I want to find meaning. I want to be remembered. I fight with different aspects of being unhappy everyday. But that’s my struggle, I will keep working, I will keep writing. I might not go down in history, but I will fight to get it every step along the way. Because I know deep down, that is a life that is worth living. That is something that might be worth dying for.

IStoleTheSweetrolls [info] Sometimes, but not always.  Most people with mental illnesses are not violent, and they're more likely to be victims of abuse than people who are mentally healthy.  Not all mental illnesses are the same, and even people with the same diagnosis often behave very differently from each other.  And people recover.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was involuntarily committed for attempting suicide years ago, but I've worked very hard to get better.

hlkolaya [info] haha- well I'll tell you some of my own experiences. if you're not a believer in the supernatural, read to the end before downvoting. I could hear and see ghosts from the time I was a child. Because of this I left Christianity when I was 12 and became Pagan. I often heard people speaking to me at night or when I was alone- I could hear footsteps. Once, at a friend's, I woke up in the middle of the night to see a little girl sitting at the end of my bed. The next night I heard someone walking outside of my friend's bedroom door in the middle of the night- I couldn't sleep and waited for them to fade. My friend confirmed there was a little girl ghost in her house.When I was a little older and in my first apartment I began having dreams of falling into darkness and not being able to wake up. Dreams of a strange, shadowy man who would grab me and pull me into some black pit. Once a white hand grabbed my ankle while I was laying in bed and a few days later, while reading, I felt something in the room.. so i put my book down and right in front of me was a man- dripping wet, bloated, and pale. I ran out of there as quickly as I could! All of these incidences involved the same entity. These are only a few of the things that I experienced in my Pagan days- that doesn't count ceremonies, rituals, spells, psychic visions, past lives, etc. When I was 22 I was diagnosed with bipolar. Turns out they were all just hallucinations and medication took care of it. TL;DR I became pagan because I could hear and see ghosts. Turns out I was just hallucinating because I was bipolar. Meds=no more "ghosts". The supernatural can be explained with science. [info] None [info] 1284076078

Some psychiatrists have wait times months out and that doesn't help either*  YOU know yourself better than anyone and you can read posts and say "this is my life constantly" where again, your psych may end up misdiagnosing you* ADHD diagnosis are extremely poor in girls and this often leads to a misdiagnosis for something else* Can I mention being poor and low access to care again?* Even if a psych makes a wrong diagnosis it's important to realize that not everyone can get a second opinion, and it can be years later until they find out something like "oh, turns out, I don't have X, I have Y"Anecdotally, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I knew I didn't have it and refused to take the medicine, and years later, I asked my psych while I was being re-evaluated, and she was like, "yeah, you don't have the mania associated with it, I don't know what she was thinking". Point is, your mental health professional is flawed, they are human, they can/will make mistakes in your care and misdiagnosing is extremely comming, and self diagnosing can be very helpful and can offer up support. Self medicating is a whole 'nother issue tho and I don't recommend that. [info] None [info] 1560608073
abswank [info] Thanks~  Canceling the wedding was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I knew something was 'off' when we were dress searching and I just couldn't/wouldn't get excited.  (And it wasn't just my contrary nature kicking in.  I wanted to be excited, I just couldn't.)  I had to have multiple people tell me it was okay to cancel the wedding, that it didn't matter how much time and money we'd put in or how many people we'd disappoint, I had to do what was right for me.  So first I delayed it a year and then I cancelled it and used the money we'd put towards reservations to pay for a deposit on a new place.  I don't think I've ever been my best friend - it's always been easier to care about other people more than myself.  Probably how I got in to a situation like this, lol.  A lot of this was made more difficult because I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year.  (Which of course was used against me later.  See his comment about mood swings.  Never used words like that until after the diagnosis.)  For the first time I ever I feel like I have something to talk about in therapy without being asked.  Trying to think of all of this as a blessing in disguise.  I just don't know how I'll get over the knowledge that 6 years of 'true love' was a lie.  Like, how do you even begin to trust again after something like that?  We had so many mutual friends.  He was the roommate of my best friend and her now husband.  Never knowing which parts were genuine and which parts were his illness is probably what will always get me.  Thanks for taking the time to read/listen.  It really means a lot.  My own mother, a self professed 'empath', somehow has no clue about what I'm going through and even asked, "What do you have to be stressed about?"

aherewego [info] Bipolar pagan with trouble grounding. Hello! I have a history of mental illness. I've been diagnosed with bipolar (amongst other things) and feel it's relatively accurate. I take care of myself with supplements, eating well, exercise, therapy - no worries there. I just want to make that clear. My issue lately is energy work. In circle I raise so mich energy. It is not the same as mania/hypo mania, but it's so close for me - my body races and surges with energy, and I don't know what to do with it. When I do energy visualizations, I feel the same way. I feel the buildup of energy and lack of control. It scares me because it's so similar to hypo mania. It always coincides with my circle or meditation work. I visualize grounding, touch the earth, eat and do worldly things afterwards. Yet I'm left with all this energy I can't handle. What do??? [info] None [info] 1412347087
gigee4711 [info] I'm Mad I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 16 years. I did not actively seek treatment until about 8 months ago. This has mostly consisted of therapy. But then around June I started taking Wellbutrin and Lamictal. I felt stable for the first time in my life and it was great until I started having cognitive side effects from the lamictal. I stopped the lamictal and was thrown into mania now I'm in a mixed state and irritated all the time. I can't stand myself. I was started on Trokendi XR which is not helping. I'm mad I have this disorder. I lived so long thinking I was in control then I got a taste of "normal" and realize how hard everything is as a result of the disorder and how much I am not in control. Technically it's a disability and it just pisses me off. I know other people have it worse and I need to suck it up because this is how life is.

I've been diagnosed with bipolar and i've started taking meds in june and during summer i never thought about the impact it would have on school. I've never been the type that actually studies, i never felt the need to do homework or really put effort into anything because i'd still do good without trying. But now my grades are getting incredibly low and I feel so disappointed in myself, my parents, teachers and psychiatrists know my condition and don't put any pressure on me, it is only myself who always expects perfection.

married_to_a_reddito [info] I am depressed. Can anyone help? So I am clinically depressed. I am diagnosed with bipolar II, PTSD, GAD, and OCD symptoms. I'm under the care of a secular therapist and a psychiatrist and am on medications for bipolar disorder. Basically, bipolar is difficult to treat. You treat it with mood stabilizers, not so much antidepressants. Some people can take them, but I can't. They make my condition worse, as they do for many individuals. All this means I've hit a wall. I'm stable now, but I'm depressed. My doctor says there is nothing left medically they can do. My therapist is no longer helping me (I'm still seeing her, it's just not helping. I've been seeing her for a few years). Basically, I feel like the only one who can help me is Heavenly Father. Does anyone know any way that I can seek spiritual healing? I'm open to anything (as long as it is Christian based). I think the only way I can truly be healed at this point is by the spirit. [info] Christian [info] 1469669156

LadySullivan [info] The therapist might have been independent or working with others in a practice, can’t remember, but it wasn’t in a school. Therapists had a hard time with me because I exhibited behaviors of someone abused, but never was. One of my psychs kind of hinted that maybe I was hiding something (which admittedly I did some times) but I didn’t have a dark past at all. I was diagnosed with bipolar so with the right meds to even out my mood, some aging, and a series of good decisions, I was able to overcome it. No therapist has ever helped me, but there was at least one that meant well, and it was nice to talk to someone who understood my condition. The only thing that really helped was medicine that made me think clearly enough to make better decisions for my life and it just snowballed into better circumstances. In general I would recommend therapy over medicine, but that wasn’t the best fit for me at the time. Come to think of it, the support group I attended for a while helped me a lot more. Being around others that could empathize as well as being support for them in return was a much more positive experience for me.  [info] None [info] 1542408364

inkedandnerdy [info] Okay. So I'm going to tell a little bit of my story here to answer this. I was first diagnosed four years ago. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, BPD, GAD, and PTSD. All after severe trauma. I went to see a therapist for the first time when I decided I wanted to end an abusive relationship I was in and did not know how to and I needed strength and I knew it had messed me up. My first therapist told me one of the times I got raped didn't count because I was drunk. I walked out and then went back two weeks later. I fought. I found a therapist that worked for me. I got on an anti-depressant. My brain only wants to kill itself when I am lost in my trauma or I decide I'm worthless (also rooted in trauma.) Yes, I think my healthy brain never wants to kill itself. If suicide was natural and healthy-thinking, I don't see how the human race could be where it is today. Every mammal is built for survival. We fight to survive. That's life. And it's hard and it sucks. But I truly believe whatever you have going on, it gets better if you're willing to give it a chance and fight for yourself.

StaringAtTheGalaxy [info] Wow!  You sound so much like me!  I'm bipolar also, and especially in middle and high school I was bullied for being "different" and highly intelligent.  The bizarre intelligence was always present because it was something I clung to for inspiration, but only during my manic phases did friends and peers see how "weird" I was.  I'm not, I just have unique interests for my geographical location like anime, foreign literature, video games, (I'm a girl), volunteer work, etc.I'm 22 now and was only hospitalized and evaluated for the first time two and a half years ago.  During the first hospitalization I was diagnosed with bipolar and panic attacks.  I've been hospitalized for related struggles since then.My panic attacks, to me, usually seem to be a result of my brain "misfiring" or "being an asshole," as you said.  I know I've told my fiancé the latter explicitly before.  "I wake up in a good mood then end up having a panic attack in class...  I feel like my brain's just being an ass!"If I don't get somewhere alone to deal with mine...  they just repeat, repeat, repeat, until I am alone, and then it peaks and it's terrible.  Sometimes, if there's many repeated attacks, it affects me for several days--either more attacks or a major mood swing.  I do feel that my fiancé has helped me with this, though, especially the "I'm losing my mind!" sensation of a sudden panic attack.  Though in public, those are still terrible.  Sometimes I feel like my brain postpones the worst ones until I'm in the car or at home. [info] None [info] 1414549673
jesssek [info] I’ve been wanting to stop taking my meds I was diagnosed with bipolar ii this October and added Latuda (a mood stabilizer) to the meds I take. Honestly, the meds have been working great. I feel more stable than I have in years. But I’m also getting antsy, almost bored, with the normality I’m experiencing, which makes me want to stop taking them. I KNOW logically that if I stop taking them, I will start to feel bad, but there’s this self-destructive, risk-desiring voice in the back of my head that says stop taking them so you can feel something other than “normal” again. Has anyone else ever experienced this? How do you combat the part of you that wants to do something risky and stupid for the sake of feeling out of control or more alive?

Lashi_000 [info] Am I delusional? Earlier this year I was diagnosed with bipolar two after a huge meltdown that led me to be hospitalized and had to dropout of school. Ever since that major episode I feel like my brain has just been rotting away.I've been starting to believe that my mom sits outside of my room listening to everything I say so she could gather every bit information about me for some third party. I think that these numbers that keep appearing (556, 314, 115) are some sort of cipher that some other worldly being is trying to warn me about something, and I've every time I see these numbers I search around for anything of significance around me to see what the numbers are trying to tell me. There are a few others that I rather not get into, but, my main question is, if, at some points like now, I'm capable of recognizing they aren't real then am I not delusional?The thing that makes this hard for me to answer this is that in the moment that these things come up, such as my mom being home or seeing the numbers, I fully and entirely believe that they are true. I really just want to know the answer before I talk to my therapist about it only to feel like an idiot if this was just some normal thing for human beings, but ,for me, I am immensely concerned and scared for my mental state in the future.

CoyoteLovelyYT [info] So, I'd like to preface this reply with a bit of a personal anecdote. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and a mild case of Asperger's Syndrome when I was a teenager. I struggled a lot with the diagnosis, both when I first got it and having to cope with the knowledge of it's presence, and at many other points in my life when I lost opportunities I never expected would be lost (examples, I wanted to enlist in the military or become a police officer when I grew up, both were things I couldn't do with my diagnosis). There were a lot of points in my life that were absolutely devastating given the circumstances around them, and it has been and still is a challenge to cope with everything to this day.One of the videos that always stuck with me that I saw on YouTube was from Game Theory, the episode on the game "Until Dawn". So much of that video resonated with me on so many unique levels because I felt that personal connection to the subject matter, both through the message of the content and the struggles of the characters in the topic.I am opening with that because this video brought me right back to 2015 when I first saw that episode. So much of what you discussed with this game, it resonated with me on exactly the same levels, and based on how you opened the review, it showed it resonated the same way with you. That is a very, VERY difficult thing to accomplish in my opinion, and you did so with aplomb. Damn, this video deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten, because the way you discussed the themes here in conjunction with the game was just... I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it was!I sincerely hope you keep this up, because there is so much here that is working for you. Strong audio quality, excellent understanding and conveyance of themes, and a good approach to the subject matter that can leave a person still able to take away something even if the game doesn't fully appeal to them.Outstanding job man, sincerely!\~ [info] None [info] 1566810441

socratesthefoolish [info] Thanks MedievalPenguin! I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well. I never attempted to suicide, but I was hospitalized roughly 3 years ago.After being hospitalized, I received treatment, and after some time, I was able to discontinue use of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. My doctor is always really pleased to see me, because the outlook for people with our disease typically is very poor.It helps though, that I converted after my hospitalization. Whenever I get any weird thoughts, I can immediately ignore them, and recognize their source, because God, who is Truth, Goodness, and Love itself, wouldn't present me with the possibility of completely insane things being true. So, I've been asymptomatic for the past three years (disregarding the occasional insane thought once every month or so, which, all thanks be to God, I'm able to put to rest within a millisecond or so).I still take medication for ADHD, but for some reason I doubt that that would be as concerning as bipolar disorder.Have hope! I'm not sure if you get completely insane thoughts like I do, but, if you can begin to recognize their character, ask God to give you the grace to have a sincere and total revulsion for them. Eventually, they will become less and less frequent as time goes on.For me, it's all a matter of not giving into the insane thoughts. Without my faith, I couldn't give a principled reason to do that. But, taking for granted the truth of the Gospels, Sacred Tradition, the Magisterium of the Church, and the insights of the Doctors of the Church, the insane thoughts are pretty much akin to a fly that I will have to shoo away occasionally.Edit 1:For anyone else reading that has problems with irrational thoughts, taking these steps have been a tremendous help:1. Go about your day.2. If presented with a strange thought, immediately recall to your mind first, that God exists, and that his existence can be proved by reason, following from cause to effect, second, that because God is Goodness itself, and the Good does not deceive, that God created the world, and yourself, in an orderly, reasonable way and third, that the past, and your memories of the past are reliable, and thus, because this strange thought would contradict one or more of the preceding, it must be immediately disregarded, deeply resented, and recognized as the wicked fruits of a wicked creature.3. Thank God that He has given you this opportunity to grow in the spiritual life, and more completely depend on Him, and His promises for your well-being.4. Say an Our Father, Hail Mary, or Prayer to St. Michael (this is my standard rebuke).5. Immediately put it in the past, and go about your day. When it happens again, go back to step 2.Edit 2: It is of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NEVER DOUBT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN NUMBER 2. IF YOU SINCERELY BEGIN TO DOUBT THEM, YOU ARE DONE, TOAST, I HOPE YOU ENJOY HOSPITAL FOOD, THEY ARE DOGMAS FOR YOU [info] None [info] 1434496819
WellOkayyThenn [info] It's weird knowing when I'm in my hypomania state. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last week. Today I realised I was being hypomanic. But it's not like I can just stop it. It gave me this weird feeling of being trapped in my mind. I didn't actually feel that happy, but I kept acting all excited and I was talking all fast and being all social. Being able to say "im in the middle of some hypomania" really freaks me out. I don't know how to explain it to anyone, and my therapist always looks at me like I'm crazy when I try to describe it, but hypomania makes me feel like I'm trapped inside my mind.

I hope I'm not doing this wrong.I have experienced a lot of what you talk about going through, starting at age 15. Around age 20, after 5 years of disorienting mental agony, I was diagnosed with bipolar type I. You may be just fine, these things happen to many of us, even people who are overall mentally healthy, but if you are truly concerned about your mental well-being it wouldn't hurt to have someone look under the hood.Point is, mental health is no joke and you should speak to a professional. My parents couldn't afford it either, but the university I attended offered free consultations and therapy sessions with licensed practitioners through the university health services department. Even if you can't afford it outright and want to skip school counselors, there are other ways to get the help you need. Plus you have access to resources I didn't at the time (20 years ago).

He's known about ny bipolar disorder since we were friends, but really saw it for the first time in February. I had a massive manic episode due to my psych constantly cancelling appts. after taking me off a stable dose.

My hometown used to be famous for its mercury mines. I liked all the coincidences.  [info] None [info] 1411367420
ChaosTheRedMonkey [info] It's a trend that applies to many mental conditions and I am always a bit surprised that apparently people have a hard time reconciling the trend with Autism. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder pretty early (around 4th grade so like..8 years old?). The doc who diagnosed it was a bit stumped on how to treat me because it usually wasn't diagnosed that early, and suggested I get evaluated later in life to be certain about the diagnosis. 20 years later it still fits.Anyway, I remember when we first started talking about history of mental illness in the family my dad said something like this: "Well none that I know of, unless being an alcoholic counts. But its hard to be sure. My folks and their generation tend to be tight lipped about that kind of thing, and would rarely get checked out. So at most we might have stories of "Weird Uncle Billy who was always a bit odd" or something."So yeah, definitely an awareness and openness shift has impact stuff like this.

JeffRulesYou [info] Well, unfortunately before I got diagnosed when I was going through my "episodes" I did a lot of uncharacteristic things and hurt a lot of people (not intentionally) I was just very unstable at the time and not myself, but my family and friends didn't know I was ill and blamed a lot of my faults on bad behavior and personality.  This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  As I've gotten older people have used my disorder against me for either (a) things I can't remember doing in the past or (b) any sort of emotion/decision I make in the present.  My disorder is always mentioned in those regards.  I try not to get upset, because I know they mean well, but it is very frustrating and upsetting to be reminded of it.  It's hard to find a balance of the two without either party getting upset with one another.  Also, not everyone is truly going to understand.  So, you have to be as honest as possible with your loved ones on how you feel when they try and do that to you.  Also, I forgot to mention if you're doing well and are stable than they have absolutely no right using it against you.   [info] None [info] 1470331671
IwamineShuu [info] "There's nothing wrong with you, you're normal." Growing up, I knew I was inherently different from everyone around me. I didn't have the words to express it, it was something I felt naturally and without needing to analyze. I just simply knew I was different.I struggled. I struggled with other children poking me, throwing scratchy things at me until I cried and they'd laugh at for crying at 'just a joke.' I had no words to describe what was happening. I tried my best to make friends and I was met time after time with hostility and cruelty from my peers for simply existing and being different.Fat and worst of all, there was something beyond the fat that was wrong with me. Combined with my at-home lifestyle of being mocked by my parents and siblings for my peculiarities, to being poked and prodded until I had a meltdown and screamed and slammed myself into walls while no one did anything to stop. I was a spoiled brat, my diagnosis was "devil child."A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and autism. Last week I was diagnosed with bipolar type ii. It feels strange. Many people find strength in being 'normal', but normalness has always been used as a weapon against me. To deny the fact that the vacuum made me unable to breathe, to deny the fact that eating hamburger made me literally throw up due to the texture. Being normal meant I was making it up and I was a bad kid.I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't normal. And instead of being sad, I feel victorious. I was right, I was right all along and every adult who betrayed me and did nothing was wrong. In a way, I win. I'm getting the help and assistance I need, I'm validated. And fuck does it feel good.

dragonfly_blue [info] I am currently at home on a six-hour pass from the HCMC psych ward in Minneapolis, due back in less than an hour and just wanted to check in with Reddit before I leave. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am listed as being disabled since 2005 by my doctors and Social Security, so I get a check from SSI monthly for about $750.00.

Bigpoppapenguin123 [info] Has anyone went back on an old medication and find it working again? Hello all. I used to be on Effexor XR 4 years ago. 37.5mg alone helped me out of a depressive slump big time! After being on 75mg for months, it stopped working. I was also flipping back and forth between the immediate release and the xr. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 or NOS, and I’m currently on abilify. I was thinking about trying a low dose Effexor again along with my abilify to see if I see some kind of relief once again. I’ve been on a medication carousel since, trying things like Prozac, Zoloft, pristiq, Wellbutrin and viibryd which sent me to hell! Has anybody ever been able to go back on a previous medication and find that it helps again? Any experience, good or bad would be appreciated! [info] None [info] 1579797962

I have no idea what's wrong with me, but I did similar stuff like this when I wasn't medicated-- But I'm medicated right now. My wife has Narcolepsy and fell asleep while trying to calm me down. Before I knew it I found myself at Walmart. I had went from my house and drove to Walmart with my wife's car. I texted her to let her know where I was, but I haven't received anything from her or anyone. So I guess I'm shit up a creek, but I need to figure out what I am supposed to do about this.

sailingthesasseas [info] Bipolar disorder + ADHD... sometimes I can't even tell which one to blame So, since I was about 12, (I'm 27 now) I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD. (now ADHD-PI, per DSM-V)Nowadays, I'm not really noticing the Bipolar symptoms nearly as much as I am the ADHD symptoms, and I can't remember the last time I had a real episode of anything, just wandering about in the euthymia(sp?) spectrum. Has anyone had something like this before? Maybe the symptoms are just being subsumed into my ADHD, maybe the ADHD is just getting worse. It's improbable that the bipolar disorder would just... fade away, right? My does of Li is at least half of what it would therapeutically be, although I don't know if I'd want to risk not having it. But has anyone experienced something similar?NB: Yes, I am in the process of scheduling an appointment with my shrink, but I want to know what other peoples' experiences are.

jess-mills_ [info] Ok so before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Prozac. During the intake all she asked me was how I felt on a scale of 1-10. I also have dermatillomania, which is a type of ocd. She literally said prozac would solve all of my problems if I went on the max dose. She prescribed me 20mg and bumped it to 40mg the next week. She also said I didn't need to see a therapist and I should call in a month to check in. About 4 weeks later when the side effects kicked in, I started my sophomore year of college. Long story short the prozac activated my bipolar, and I went through a manic phase without realizing it and a depressive phase. Long story short I ended up in the hospital because I drank way too much and hit my head on a table and had to get 4 staples in my head. It kinda funny - I told the nurse that my gown could be a prom dress lolol. I was very suicidal in the hospital and the psychiatrist at the hospital said I was possibly bipolar. So I went back to my psychiatrist and explained everything that happened at school (I had dropped out at this point). She was like oh ok well the meds won't work on ocd unless you are on 80mg...so she literally prescribed me 80mg and I was like wtf I basically went insane on 40mg...so I told her I didn't feel comfortable with 80mg and the psychiatrist at the hospital thought the prozac was activating the bipolar. She literally said "oh you probably just talked to a social worker at the hospital. They don't know what they are talking about, but if you are feeling bipolar we can try a different medication" So then she proceeds to scroll through her phone (she wasn't even on a computer or taking notes for any of it) and after a few minutes she was like hmm maybe this one. So she prescribed me seroquel and she was like "oh this is an antipsychotic but it doesn't mean you are psychotic. Take it tonight and call me in the morning if you feel hungover" I explained I had taken the 40mg of prozac that morning and she was like oh that's fine. So basically I was like um shes crazy and never picked up the prescription and never went back to her... [info] None [info] 1556354464
coffeeandjesus1986 [info] My ex boyfriend-emphasis on ex. Almost 14 years ago he was drunk one night and I told him I wouldn’t go out with him that night he was drunk and I wasn’t going to be the designated driver. Plus I was sick of his abuse when he was drinking. He had raped me twice previously, tripped me down a flight of stairs because I wasn’t paying enough attention to him I hit my head on concrete knocked me unconscious but I stayed I thought it was my fault.It escalated. That night he took my no as an insult. He punched me in the nose, busted my lip and gave me two black eyes. He then proceeded to choke me and then I fell to the ground. He then using his steel toed boots (famous brand begins with a “T”) to kick me in the ribs and delicate areas. I started screaming help and then in the far corner of my eye I saw my best guy friend as it faded to black. Best guy friend I found out slugged him in the face and drug him away from me. I don’t remember this but I told him take me home just don’t tell anyone. I awoke in the backseat of my car in absolute agony watching the street lights go by I was under the blanket I kept in my car. Best guy friend was taking me home. I blacked out again woke up in my bed with him staying with me. The next day he called my girlfriend (not lover just best friend) so they arranged a meeting telling me to leave him. I will never forget looking in my bathroom mirror my face was bloody and black and blue. I had a bruise from my armpit to hip and my ribs hurt. I never saw him again I never pressed charges I tried to move on with my life.I entered therapy 5 years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and complex ptsd from the abuse. I still have nightmares and I still flinch sometimes when I’m touched. I have a beginning of a uterine prolapse from the abuse. I’m married to an amazing husband who has never hurt me pushed me to get help and has been by my side through it all. Domestic violence is horrible I’m just glad I’m alive.

getthelinguist [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago, after 10 years of suffering. I was reluctant to take meds, thinking that it would dull me, that I wouldn't really be "me" anymore. But I had been feeling so bad for so long that I decided to take the damn pills anyway. And I haven't regretted it one second. Yes, they have side effects. Yes, finding the right "cocktail" that works for me was a pain and it took time (more than I had hoped). But I am now stable and working on getting myself physically healthy again. Fundamentally, my personality hasn't changed at all... I still have the capacity to get really, really excited about some things, and really, really sad about others. I didn't lose myself when I agreed to take the meds, on the contrary: I found myself.

lfkstlpnw [info] Seeing a new psychologist Thursday I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year and had twice-weekly sessions with a psychologist for almost a year. I learned a lot and healed a lot with his help. A few month ago I decided to take a break from him because I was feeling like we weren’t doing anything in the sessions but small talk, and I was feeling in a good place.I’ve been struggling much more lately and decided it’s time to go back to therapy. For many reasons, I am not wanting to continue with the same guy who helped diagnose me, so I am seeing a new psychologist this Thursday. I’m annoyed that I’ll have to start from scratch with her (if I even like her), but I know that’s just what comes with my decision. But I’m looking forward to it and trying to be optimistic!

Seouldier12 [info] I need to get out of my PhD program as quickly as possible. I am starting my fifth and final year as a PhD student in engineering. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder about 9 months and am fairly certain that I cannot complete what remains for me to be able to graduate. Things have gotten to the point where every single email from my advisor or another labmate sends me into a panic attack. I don't know that it's really worth going into all the detail to explain why exactly, just that he keeps giving me more and more to do in less and less time with almost no feedback other than vague things like "this needs work".Again, I feel very strongly that I cannot continue. I have mentioned this to him several times, and the changes he enacts to keep my workload at a reasonable level only last days to at most three weeks, and then it's back to the intense stress and expectations.I have been anticipating graduating in December, but honestly I don't think I can make it through January, let alone another 10-11 months. I intend to speak with a department graduate advisor to determine if and how quickly I can leave with a Master's, but I'm not sure if that's possible or if I could even last out this whole upcoming semester. What advice can you give me for negotiating with him and the department to be able to leave as quickly and beneficially as possible? [info] None [info] 1514835761
-Master-Builder- [info] I wouldn't say it's negatively effected my life.I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I in the USN, but I have been self-medicating with marijuana since I was about 14. After joining the military, I obviously stopped smoking marijuana. I didn't realize at the time that it was the only thing keeping my mood stable. During my time in the military, due to a combination of stress and lack of medication, I had the biggest psychotic episode of my life. This is what led to my hospitalization and diagnoses of bipolar type II.Now I'm vaporizing marijuana on a daily basis, and it helped me quit my cigarette addiction of 10 years. I haven't had a major episode in years, and I can fall asleep every night (insomnia comes hand in hand with bipolar). Needless to say, the only thing about marijuana that negatively effects my life is the laws that govern it. [info] None [info] 1442523729
ben_ji1974 [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar for years. Been in treatment off and on for years. I spent nearly 3 years out of work and doped up while fighting for disability only to get shut down.During this period in my life I am unmedicated and relatively stable though there have been cost. I don't have the energy to fight a broken system and I know one day time will run out. All I can do is muddle through with one foot in front of the other and try to avoid doing too much stupid crap.For me to try to live a long life the only way I can see that happening is socially isolating myself. While I can muddle through just about any job, I have had so many that at one time my G.A.F. was a 38. I don't like it. I dont have the highs as much anymore but a slow steady low keeps me going just enough to function without crashing. I try to manage everything with routine and trying not abuse alcohol or drugs. I am very fortunate to have my current wife, she truly is my best friend and a far more wonderful person than I could have hoped to have in my life.

garbagetrain [info] The mixing up words thing is really weird and I still haven’t completely figured it out, but I think it mostly happens during psychotic episodes. It happens other times too, but much more subtly.I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD at the same time when I was 22 and started taking Lamictal. Then I started taking Adderall about two months later. The insomnia should go away after you get used to taking it regularly. When I’m not taking it regularly I have to make sure that I take it early enough in the day that it won’t keep me up. One bad night of sleep is enough to trigger mania for me so sleep is extremely important for me.I also felt that my brain was “frozen” and this continued for over a year after starting medication. For me, we think it is psychosis. One of my doctors thinks I have schizoaffective, instead of Bipolar 1 w/psychosis which is my official diagnosis.I have also noticed that certain foods make my brain scrambled. Like I have to be really careful what I eat before I go to work or do anything important because I literally cannot function sometimes because of it.Don’t end it. I have been soooo close so many times and the manic episode that got me diagnosed was the worst thing that I have ever experienced in my life, but medication really helped. I still want to die sometimes but it’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be. My life improved so much since getting on medication. I’m like a completely different person now.Stick it out until you can get medication :\) [info] None [info] 1524964066
fivedollarbill [info] mind dump may not be comprehensible So if you read my post history http://www.reddit.com/user/fivedollarbill/ you'll see I fucked up greatly in my mind, my family is dysfunctional and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on seroquel (now 300mg) I've felt pretty good, at the beginning it was a bit rocky but now I feel somewhat normal but not entirely. I can't tell if what I felt/feeling now is normal or bipolar (happy vs mania etc) (does this make sense?) My family says I'm doing better and I guess I have been but I feel really flat. hardly any interesting emotion. not really happy, not really sad. So that's saddening. Which I hate. It's not any easier to work, I'm not getting more stuff done and I'm not really engaging in any more social activities. I can't tell if I'm manic now. I've always thought and spoke fast but is that mania? I don't know! I have racing thoughts right now but they're not as emotionally charged as they usually would be if I were manic. I don't like my seroquel, really, cause it makes me tired and like I said I don't do any more work and I feel flat. I'm watching secret life of the manic depressive and I really relate to some of it and some of it makes me question if I'm bipolar. It's 1 AM here, and I'm not tired (I haven't taken my pills yet) are my pills working? I don't know. I'm slightly tired but I really have the urge to write out all these feelings (which is odd). I'm less paranoid than I was before. My opinion and outlook and shit after being diagnosed has changed, maybe. I kinda find myself justifying things, or doing things like this, writing on a bipolar support place and speaking of things like I've written. My psych and mother say I'm doing really well. I don't feel like that. I wish I could concentrate better and feel less emotionally neutral.I think I have more things to say but I don't feel like typing them out.what the fuck did I write this for [info] None [info] 1353655897

kitty07s [info] &gt;  fat after being on antipsychotics for a few years.That is one of the mysteries to me, because that is what happened to me as well. I was gaining and losing weight normally ranging between 125-150 since high school due to hormonal changes, appetite changes, eating and activity then I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was 145 lb and due to manic espisode and incredible energy I worked out like crazy and lost again to 123-125 lb, then I was diagnosed and I was put on antispychotics. I gained 10 lb immediately in one week just in the hospital. Then I gained exponentially to 160 lb in 2 months! I was definitely not eating an extra 2000 cal over my TDEE which is the amount needed to gain this much in 2 months. I stopped gaining immediately after I could come off the antipsychotics but without meds it was hard to lose the extra weight. I gave up and over 5 years after I gained an additional 20 lb since I stopped caring anymore and gave up on weight loss. I am now able to lose since I am not on meds anymore. I am almost losing the extra 20 lb I gained post medication (so I am totally accountable for that) and hopefully I could lose 30 lb of the medication induced fat as well. People do have varying metabolisms but unless they have certain medical conditions, the variations is not that high. But being teenagers the growth hormones and other hormones can make you be thinner or heavier than normal because they are all wacked up and your body still changing. People's natural weight based on their diet and activity usually settles after teenage years.  For me I think my natural activity level and diet  set me around 135-145 lb in adult life. Other than that men and women who have thinner body structure are more prone to move and are more naturally active and less hungry, add the height and gender and you get even more burn, so they move around a lot more and burn a lot of calories and they don't realize it, so even if they eat crap food, they are are still not eating over their TDEEs so they don't gain. Sudden life changes that decreases those activity levels, messes up their hormones or their eating will make them gain more weight.  [info] 20lbs lost [info] 1492975624
Aleksandra1128 [info] I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child due to being very distracted (and distracting) in class. My teachers recommended that I see someone about it.

askmeifimapotato [info] Yeah, that sounds terrible! Tbh, I have been diagnosed with bipolar, and now that I've been through an extensive list of medications and therapy and working through things, I'm plenty stable, but I always worry when someone sees my meds (Effexor xr and Topamax) about how I'll be judged. My last Dr never had any qualms about any of my meds, even when I was heavily medicated, but I've had a few one-time visits with other Drs when I was strapped for money who tried to tell me that my mental health was the issue, and tried to change my meds, when I knew better. Now, I'm only changing because the plan I got through BCBS is an hmo, and there are literally zero family Drs on their provider list. It's all Drs of internal medicine at a couple different hospitals. I didn't have much choice. Even if I don't like him, there are only about 5 providers approved within a 30 mile radius. If I feel crappy, I'm not going to want to drive a half hour to the Dr. So, I'm pretty much stuck...so I'm hoping he's okay. If I don't like it at all, I may just have to pay a higher premium for a different policy in 2016. That, and I don't think my psychiatrist is in network either. I haven't been paying for it (County provider), so I'm hoping they'll work with me. Yes, post nasal drip is a huge issue, when I have it! I try to make sure I'm taking an antihistamine daily, since that helps.  [info] None [info] 1420340885
HighnessOfCats [info] First off: I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and bpd, and I want to share some insights that I've come to learn about myself and the expectations I have of my partners. I also have a little bit of a different perspective on this than others might have because I'm studying psychology in university. This might not work perfectly with what you and your SO are going through, but hopefully, it'll give you some help. Medications/therapy is important. As much as you love your partner and want to help him, you cannot do anything unless he's helping himself. It's extremely important for him to realize the strain and stress that he puts on you if he is not even trying to help himself. The on and off again cycle of medication is a really big warning sign that he believes that after a while that he's "cured" or "fine" once he starts feeling better, which is not the case. Bipolar is a lifelong mental illness that requires medication the majority of the time, and the only exception is when discussing with a psychiatrist. Hypersexuality is a thing, but people can control it. This is a sad point to make known, but if he truly did not want to cheat on you, he would not have. If you are completely monogamous this should be a warning sign to you because even in a hypersexual state people are able to direct it towards someone or something. The manias can make it difficult to rationally think about doing so, but it's still possible. But this leads back to proper medication and therapy. For this particular case, it's therapy and how to work through bouts of irrationality and hypersexuality. Next, blaming it on his mental illness is never a good sign. Mental illness a reason for difficulty within one's life, but it, and never should be, considered *the* reason someone does or doesn't do something.  There are exceptions to this, but him using it as a manipulation tactic is wrong. If he cannot see that, you have a problemI understand that you want to be a supportive partner and, in all ways, it seems like you really have been but there is only so much you can do. My SO likes to say "There is only so much warmth you can provide a person before setting yourself on fire for them". From my perspective, you've done everything that you've can and it is now up to him to do the rest. If he is consistently resisting and doing the opposite, you might want to re-think your relationship. It's not fair to you.  [info] None [info] 1492446605
hypohallucination [info] I think I was on Yasmin in my early 20s and it was good for my skin. I can't remember why I stopped, though maybe the NHS wouldn't prescribe it later on. I tried microgynon and then the progesterone only pill the summer before I was diagnosed with bipolar, though they both gave me a constant headache, twitchy right eye and worse mood swings.I really wanted to try spironolactone though the NHS won't prescribe it off label and claim it's too dangerous. They wouldn't give me metformin either because I'm in the 'normal' weight range.I'll definitely think about asking for Yasmin again.

Kattw0manus [info] Welcome! Welcome to all who desire to get better and look for ideas and inspiration at how to cope and be safe in a world where we can be extremely insecure and suffer from issues with our emotions and stability. I will gladly share my progress and experiences with my struggles and be grateful for the others who do while always considering, progress first and not perfection.I am 45 and was diagnosed in 2008. I have experienced many ups and down with treatments. I have a huge toolbox of things to combat the negativity and self-harming patterns I have habituated, however I do go back and forth with episodes which hinder employment and functioning normally with others at times. Currently, when I get overly emotional, I isolate and spend time writing and working on learning and understanding the different feelings I am having. I am also spending a lot of time meditating to calm myself down which is helping slowly and for now as I practice awareness a lot. That has taken years to understand along with some Buddhist practices.I am not sure when I began to suffer, however I remember my mother explaining a story when I was 4 and someone trying to teach me checkers in which I flung the entire board and pieces across the room. My mother replicated a lot of the same abuse on me which her father did to her so I tend to lean on the side of the house that humans do naturally reflect each other. To note on that, I am convinced we can change and even if something is a genetic disposition, we can use tools to help us.Over the course of 17 years, I tried the following medications for stability, zoloft, valium, xanax, klonopen, lamictal, trazadone, wellbutrin, geodon, adderall, ritlan and if I have left any out, you get the picture. Initially I was diagnosed with bipolar so the medication was more catered in that avenue. I was so curious about my natural state that I insisted a psychiatrist at a rehab I attended take me off all medication to see really what was happening with me as I felt suicidal on pretty much everything I took. I am medication free these a days and utilize talk therapy once a week no matter what. Sometimes I make leaps and bounds and sometimes I don't want to be in my therapist office and have some emotional breakdown where I turn into a little kid crying while trying to communicate. I have been known to abandon therapist in the past for months at the time when I felt uncomfortable and it wasn't a good thing as I only sought help when I thought I needed it the most. I have decided, talk therapy will be in place until I am dead probably. It is my life-line. I have possibly more issues than if I took medication, however the feeling of altering my senses and the side-effects that come along with them aren't worth it to me. I deal with many different addictions which impulsivity plays into and one of them is prescription medication as well and can't control the impulsivity of abusing the meds first and I have tried to OD twice which I survived (Thank you God). I need to use skills from CBT and DBT to deal with life on it's terms.The difficult impulsivity items I work on creating different habits for are addiction, suicide attempts, negative attention seeking through anger, cutting, eating disorders, excessive spending, sexual compulsion and filtering my communication.&amp;#x200B;Happy Sharing!&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1537572377
jellyresult [info] It depends who you’re telling. In certain situations, like you’re an easily replaceable low level employee with an at will employment contract, probably not a good idea to tell them. There’s always a possibility that your boss may not be as understanding as you think, and try to find little things to fire you over, or make you quit. I worked front desk at a hotel once, and after a little while my manager and the group, who were super tight knit friends, wanted to know more about me. Eventually I spill the beans that I deal with mental illness (at the time I was diagnosed with bipolar, which ended up being an incorrect diagnosis). It seemed to go over fine, everyone seemed cool about it. Then the next week I’m in the ER at 3 am for severe and sudden cramps, and text my manager that I won’t be able to make it to my 7 am shift. She texts me at 7 am that I’m fired, “this isn’t going to work out”, etc, and to pick up my final paycheck with HR. And because I live in Florida, my employment contract was at-will, meaning they or I could terminate employment for any reason at any time. If I hadn’t told anyone about my mental illness, I would not have been fired for missing one single shift with evidence from the hospital that I was in the ER. A friend of mine recently was hospitalized for 72 hours in the psych unit. He mistakenly told his boss he was in the psych unit- instantly fired as soon as “psych unit” was spoken. But had he been, idk, in a car accident, he would not have gotten fired, as that’s exactly what happened to a coworker, and he kept his job. Moral of the story: you don’t need to tell anyone except your closest people, and especially don’t tell an employer, unless it is 100000% necessary, because many people will try to screw you over.

Moonbaby313 [info] Well I was diagnosed with bipolar after a break down. I pushed everyone out of my life and then mentally I just...snapped. When I reached out for help and I was diagnosed it kinda mind-screwed me. I went from this sense of superiority and feeling like I wasn't getting what I deserved to feeling like something was wrong with me. Now I guess Im scared to deal with people because I don't know which part is actually me. So it's easier to just keep my distance I guess. I am in therapy and I do have 2 people in my life who know my diagnosis. They are very supportive so I've learned not to take them for granted. because the self inflated ego was part of the mania, it's easier to identify and not get caught up in. In some ways I'm more relatable...but now I don't feel comfortable letting people get close to me. Such is life. [info] None [info] 1516921615
mistixs [info] Well...I entered the therapy when I was 16, a sophomore in HS...I went into the mental hospital first, WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE 0/10 DON'T RECOMMEND GOING TO SUMMIT OAKS IN NJ EVER. It was literally the closest to hell on Earth I've ever gotten. I'm not even kidding. But that's only the hospital I went to. There are many hospitals that are better than the one I went to. So I'm not bashing hospitals in general; I'm just bashing Summit Oaks. Anyway, after that, I went to a Partial Hospital Program, which was basically a "hospital" I went to, but only during normal school hours, from like 8am to 3pm. That *really* helped. That's where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and learned a lot of these coping skills, including the ice cubes one. They had different "classes" throughout the day, like anger management, group therapy, etc. I do recommend. I used to go into psychotic rages like you wouldn't believe, for really stupid reasons, but with the therapy, I learned how to control it &amp; channel my anger in healthy ways. (&amp; For further update, I then went to a therapeutic school to finish up high school, and just graduated last month. I'm doing so much better now. My mom said that sending me to the therapeutic school was a godsend. Now it's at the point that it's not that I need to control my rage, I actually don't feel any rage to begin with! Which is amazing, considering how it used to be a weekly thing) You can still go to Partial Hospital Programs even if you're not in school. Like, adults can go to them, too. But you probably don't want something that intensive, so I would recommend going to anger management therapy classes in general, whether in a group, or solo. Learning CBT &amp; DBT skills is also good. Even if you don't see an actual therapist, you can probably find PDFs online! :)  [info] None [info] 1438637789

asdfghBEARS69 [info] I am currently suspended at work for reporting multie customers who may have called me a homophobic slur. I might get fired Background: I'm an adult gay man in Chicago, IL. I work at a restaurant and I have been diagnosed with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. My company never asked if I had a mental illness, but I ended up telling my boss recently.Basically, i asked my boss if I could no longer serve for multiple people who I thought called me a homophobic slur as I walked away. Note: I have never failed at my job or made any serious errors. My boss got fed up and said, "I think you're making this up. There is no way 2-3 people in the last year have called you that" He then told me to take some time off. I asked him when I can come back and he said we're going to have to talk about where we can go from here. I understand that having to deal with drama might not be ideal, but I never confronted any of my patrons. All I asked for was to not be assigned to work with said individuals in the future, so I'm just not sure if this is grounds for firing.I know I am especially sensitive to that word. Sometimes I think people said it to me when they didn't. It's a frequent source of paranoia for me and stressful situations where I think people are angry at me trigger my schizoaffective and bi-polar disorders. I am medicated and able to function, but the thought disorder aspect makes me frequently mishear things and assume the worst. I promised my boss to check myself and breath if this happens again. People have used that word at me many times in my life and it's somewhat engrained in my head. If I am, in fact, wrong about being called these things, it's due to the fact that I have a diagnosed perceptual disorder that makes me ruminate on specific words and thoughts.There have absolutely been multiple times in my long career as a waiter that I am 100% certain I've been called that word. Please note that my diagnosis does not affect my ability to do this job, at this point it just causes paranoia and fixations when I'm stressed which I then talk to my manager about. Do I have any legal grounds that can prevent a termination here? [info] None [info] 1584225567
Chellybean411 [info] We were like peanut butter and jelly, Except we were Steven butter and Chelly. We met in school and instantly fell deep in love. We spent every day and night together in Brooklyn NY going to every show and making music of our own. After about 6 months I moved in with him and we lived happily together for a year or so in Williamsburg playing house and dreaming up our future. We had to move out of our love home and down deep into a dungeon like basement against my will. I didn't want to move there but because he was more financially responsible we ultimately did and had to adjust to having roommates and no windows or proper ventilation or day light reminders. This was the beginning of the end.... I lost myself down there. Forgot my identity and what it was about myself I loved. Also, I felt disconnected from him and disappointed in unfulfilled expectations. It didn't mean I didn't love him endlessly and want to spend the rest of my life with him though it was circumstantial. We be an dreaming of moving away from NYC we went to Seattle to visit my family and had the best trip ever. We were so happy and in love and I wish every day I could go back to that time. When we returned to Brooklyn he confessed to me that Seattle was a place he didn't see himself. I think it was at that moment I checked out. I began to have what I know now was my first ever manic episode. I began heavily drinking and going out with friends and made a horrible mistake one night while intoxicated  with a guy who knew me and my love but didn't care and pursued me anyways while I was very drunk. My love immediately knew something was wrong within the following days. He confronted me and I confessed to some degree about what had happened. He didn't want to know details and we dropped it. Eventually it would be the end us though. Now I am alone.I lost my home, best friend, family, band, friends and basically my whole life. On top of all of this I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very recently and I thought that maybe if I told him it would change everything and he would forgive me. But he didn't and I cannot cope. NC has been very difficult for me I slip and send him sorry I love yous all the time. It's out of my control but I can't let it go I can't stop fighting for it. I know he still loves me and I love him endlessly. I know with every fiber of my being that we are meant to be together and I can't deal with this. Every train, song, sign, store, coffee, and cigarette reminds me of him. When will he realize that we are suppose to be together? He said maybe one day we could be friends. And I cannot deal with this loss. I want to be back in our home and our bed with our dog so badly. I put my notice in at work because I'm going to Seattle to clear my head and but some distance between us but I still cling to the hope and the future and vision we imagined. I love you Steven butter. Love, Broken-hearted Chelly. [info] None [info] 1481813292

brokenteef [info] BPD and bipolar? I originally thought I had BPD when I went to my psychologist because I was so unstable, over spending, promiscuous etc. Turns out it was mania and I was diagnosed with bipolar. I have asked my psych if I had a personality disorder a few more times (because it's something that really scares me) and he has said no each time.  However, I recently got out of hospital and finally got around to reading my discharge papers. First thing it says is "cluster b personality traits". That really upset me (because I REALLY don't want to have a personality disorder).    Does anyone have any insight into this? Is it normal for a doctor to not tell you about a diagnosis change? Does "cluster b personality TRAITS" mean it's a personality disorder or just that there are similar traits? Does this possibly mean I'm not bipolar but actually borderline?  My mind is really churning through worries right now. Any thoughts will be greatly helpful (and I know nobody can really give me any medical advice, I just need to sound this all out).

HufflepuffChihuahuas [info] I feel so special. A brief history. I tried having a relationship with my hubby and another married woman, but I was in a manic state and unable to see that she was toxic and trying to get me to leave hubby. I was hospitalized during this time, when she showed her true colors. I was diagnosed with bipolar and hubby was there through the ugliness but she left. My meds, though they saved my life, pretty much killed my libido. Fast forward several years, a woman we'd met through swinging became a close friend and was fulfilling hubby's sexual needs. They dated for about a year while she and I became friends. Now, I've been on a new combo of meds and able to actually have a libido again. Now, instead of friends, we're a fully formed triad, or throuple, or whatever the term is today. I feel so loved and so special to have 2 people who know me intimately and still decide they love me, and want to be with me, faults and mental illness included. [info] triad [info] 1576545581

dandeliondid [info] Don't take it from me, really, but you might have borderline personality disorder. It can be mistaken for bipolar sometimes, since the symptoms are somewhat similar. To be honest, I was diagnosed with bipolar II (this means that the manic episodes are not as "up") when I was in my teens, but later on the diagnosis was changed to borderline.I'm pretty sure that doctors can't tell your parents what's going on unless you're planning on hurting yourself or someone else. It may take a while to find a therapist you like (i've gone through a bunch), and to develop a relationship with one that do you like. Often when dealing with emotional or mental health stuff, there's a lot of trial and error with treatments and doctors. It takes time, but if you are really worried about yourself it's worth putting the effort in. I'm glad your girlfriend is concerned for you. Even if your relationship isn't "average" or whatever, the person you're with should always have your best interests at heart.

alejandrofrankenheim [info] That's absolutely true. I was diagnosed with bipolar I a while ago, and still hide it from everyone except my close friends. Work has no idea. It's embarrassing to me, and I don't want anyone to judge me for it. I'm on meds, go to the doc regularly, all that stuff... and it really helps me function, something which I thought I could do before, but I wound up in a severe manic episode jumpstarted by drinking a shitload and very nearly fucked up my entire life. I'd always suspected there was something wrong with me, but that episode cemented it, and the doctor immediately recognized it for what it was.People judge others for their problems, sometimes on purpose or sometimes subconsciously. That's why it tends to be hidden. But, worse than that, are people who glamorize it. I've met people who think after I tell them that there's something about it that makes me a tortured genius. I'm not. I'm the guy who wakes up at two in the morning and decide to abandon my life and go live in the forest, driving for hours to get there, and then losing all interest. It's not fun, or glamorous. I talk about it on Reddit sometimes, particularly in messages, as it helps. But yeah... us nuts are hidden all over the place. [info] None [info] 1489364390

septic_wound [info] What should I do with my life ? I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder a number of years ago and since then it has gradually changed who I am.My friends have slowly drifted away, I've lost jobs sometimes my fault sometimes not most recently they said I was "too nervous"I can tell that my family doesn't really like me either.So I don't know what to do with my life now I seem to have lost everyone around me. My mood is pretty stable now and I'm happy but it doesn't change what has already being done. I haven't treated anyone badly through out any of this though I guess just being mentally ill and emotionally weak pushes people away, it's probably made me self absorbed. I've had to be thouhh to try and resolve it.How do you get out of the hole ? I've made it out mentally but my life is in tatters and it has forever changed me along the way.

fugly2 [info] Hey I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well haha. Funny that I discover r/meditation and your post here after having posted some stuff about it in another subreddit.Well, for me meditation really is a grounding exercise ("ground" as opposed to the more "spiritual" side of having thoughts and being in "other worlds" than the here and now). When I'm depressed it is mainly because I'm not staying with my own feelings (in the chest mainly, for me) but ignore them and have my attention somewhere far away (a girl that is not here, something I did in the past, worries about me-feeling-sad, et cetera). Meditation helps me a lot to get the attention inwards and stay with myself. I do this also in everyday life by looking at things around me and name them, noticing what I'm feeling (not why), and trying not to judge myself (also not judging for judging ;) ). I think I'm a lot happier because of the 2x15 minutes and the mindfulness I do.I also meditated when I'm "manic". The manic state feels really good, but I tend to have a lot of ideas about all the great stuff I'm going to do. So in the same sense as above it helps me to ground and realize that everything I'm looking for and want to do, and everything I'm feeling, is in the present moment. So keep it up, sleep well, and don't be stupid (fly from the ground :) ).PS: Have you heard about Sean Blackwell? His YouTube channel [BipolarOrWakingUp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_458663&amp;src_vid=Db8AYSrs2kk&amp;v=BnsTNEXMRL8) has a lot of videos with an interpretation of his own experience. He links the bipolar manic crisis (or (happy) psychosis - which I have experienced a few times), with satori in Zen, kundalini in yoga, samadhi in Hinduism and the visions of Christian saints. It really helped me to have a better story to integrate my ego in, so to say, and stop with meds (after the first "psychosis" - which actually was really fun except for the period of meds and hospitalization afterwards - I have never "relapsed" in anything I couldn't handle afterwards (with friends who know how I think about it to support me, but still)). Check it out! :)PPS Also: [The Stormy Search for the Self: A Guide to Personal Growth Through Transformational Crisis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stormy-Search-Self-Personal-Transformational/dp/087477649X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323120366&amp;sr=1-1).

It can feel degrading at first but many employers—at least the good ones—are empathetic and willing to work with you to find a balance for managing work life. I had a manic episode within a month of starting a new job. My employer graciously told me to take off as much time as I needed to recuperate and ensured that my position would be there waiting for me when I was ready. If you go in being completely open with your employer, you may find that they are able to help accommodate your needs. Many are willing to work with you to find the best possible ways to be effective and help you determine your strengths and the best way to apply them.  [info] None [info] 1490793372
thisisnotsarah [info] This story sounds all too familiar. Your perspective as a family member of something similar is helpful. It's gotten a little better recently, but I used to get so angry when she would be calm and optimistic. I couldn't see the world that way. I couldn't understand her positive perspective, just like she didn't quite understand my pessimistic outlook. She was always looking for possible solutions and I was always shooting them right down.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over two years ago and my doctors and I are still working to figure out what works best for me. It's a difficult disease that is irrational by nature. It's explosive, self destructive, selfish, occasionally fun, and generally difficult to treat. I know she struggled a little at first with accepting the diagnosis and the fact that she had a daughter who has a lifetime illness. She's done so much research and I know she worries because she knows how complicated the disease can be over the course of a lifetime.I know this is irrational, but I feel that there are so many other young adults out there who actually deserve a great mother like her. Who would treat her better than I do. Who would be better daughters than I am. Another piece I struggle with is that I can know that my emotions are irrational and still not be able to change my thinking, which is something I am working on with my therapist.

outonthetown [info] I have been where you are. First, if you aren't happy with your therapist and psychiatrist -- who should NOT push meds on them if you have stated you are not interested -- you can always look into seeing someone else, and make it clear you are not interested in medication. You voluntarily went for therapy, YOU are in charge of what happens there. They cannot make you take your medication, unless you become institutionalized. If you feel talk therapy can help you, I suggest looking for another therapist before quitting that. But, if you don't feel that meds are right for you -- and it looks like they might not be, don't take them. I don't, and I have a much easier time (I have been diagnosed with bipolar and BPD, the later of which I am not sure about. Always remember that psychiatry is an extremely subjective study, and many doctors will diagnose you with different things.) However, I still actively take care of myself. I eat healthy, try to exercise, take supplements, journal, and do other things for self-care. I have always believed that when possible, this is the best route of health. Today, doctors jump tot he idea that problems are caused by neurochemistry; not all are; and they jump to the fact that only pills can solve that; that's not true at all. Take care of yourself in theway that feels right for you. [info] None [info] 1376266668
eatpoetry [info] Dude I met at church camp in 2010. We had an immediate connection, made out in the dark on the last night, got told by a camp counselor to "leave room for Jesus!" while playing tonsil hockey the morning we were all leaving. I fell in love with him over the course of about 4 days, something about him said "he's the one." He told me he felt the same way. Problem was I went to college the following fall and became severely depressed. Depression led to full blown psychotic break. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but it was actually something more like PTSD. During that time I sent him a lot of strange, psychotic Facebook messages. He ended up blocking me. To say I was embarrassed when I got my right mind back was an understatement. Dying every day from shame is more accurate. At some point years later I sent him a message from someone else's Facebook account apologizing, and he unblocked me. At this point, I am in a serious relationship with someone I plan on marrying and I believe he is either married or in a similarly serious relationship (I think he's still with this one chick that he's been with for a really long time.) I have no interest in him anymore romantically. But I just wonder sometimes what he thinks of all that shit. If I could say something to him all I would say is "Damn, I'm so fucking sorry" even though I didn't really do anything to him. It was just weird because we had such an incredible connection and it fucking disappeared. [info] None [info] 1541830201

I slept between 0-1.5 hours a day for 2 weeks somehow without feeling tired and was eating close to nothing. I was overweight and wanting to lose weight for a long time, but I think primarily my manic energy and level of activity made me forget about food and I never felt hunger vs me very actively trying to restrict. Since then I’ve been put on a mood stabilizer, and experience more mild depressive episodes, but struggle so so much with binge eating during them.

AyeMyHippie [info] I cant Trust Doctors anymore I saw my first psychologist when I was 14. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17. The same doctor that diagnosed me started me on meds around the same time. Between the ages of 17-24, I was always on medication, with it changing over time. I can’t even remember all of the different meds I’ve been put on and taken off of. The entire time I felt like shit. Neautral, nothing in life matters, no happiness, no sadness, utter shit. One day, I decided I was done feeling like that. I’d rather be miserable than 100% apathetic. So I told my doctor I would like help getting off of my medication because I knew it was dangerous to just stop. He handed me a prescription and said “I can’t force you to take anything.” So, I didn’t take anything. I went through withdrawals. I threw up until there was nothing left, ate almost nothing, and spent a week in bed, wishing I would just die. It was the most miserable time of my life. Then, I started smoking weed. It helped me more than any of the meds ever did, and I could still feel emotions. It was like a rescue inhaler for extreme mood swings! That’s all I’ve used ever since. Fast forward to this year. I started a new job, and it started making me feel depressed again. I recognized that it was getting out of control and made an appointment with a therapist. The first thing she asked about was medication, and I told her what I said in this post. I also informed her that medication was absolutely off the table. I would not be going back to that. I was here for therapy and that was it. She seemed okay with that, and we started working on my issues. Then, last week, medication came up again. She wants me to consider going back on meds. I don’t want to do that. I’ve completely lost trust in my therapist, because it feels like she genuinely doesn’t care what I want, and like every other therapist I’ve ever been to, just wants to get me on medication. She says I was probably over medicated, and I’m inclined to believe that, but there’s always something in my mind telling me she’s just trying to push pills on me, like the other ones did. Is it possible to have productive therapy with that level of distrust? Is there any reason I SHOULD trust her? Do therapists that don’t rely on medication even exist? Idk, I’m just feeling a little lost right now. I don’t want to go back to medicated me. That was terrible. But I also don’t want to end up doing something stupid because I’m going through an episode.

thecrowening [info] This stuff makes me so fcking angry. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and since then have been on and off different meds trying to figure out what works. I'm not trying to invalidate her experience: side effects can be frustrating and make you feel out of control. However, I do get a little testy when she gets melodramatic about 10-15 lbs from Lexapro when I'm trying to cope with weight gain, hair loss, skin rashes, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and the emotional roller coaster of thinking I've finally found what works only to have a mood shift the next day. It's so triggering for me to watch her have an existential crisis over 15 lbs. You're absolutely right: some people don't have a choice about the weight gain. She's really privileged to be able to have that be her biggest concern about a medication. [info] None [info] 1563979766
hufflepoofs [info] When I went to seek therapy as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of the meltdowns that come with autism. My psychologist never bothered to ask me any questions about my sensory issues that I told her about, especially involving food, and just instantly prescribed me anti-psychotics which made my Asperger's even worse honestly. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I have all of the characteristics to a T and any advice I read on combating issues involved with Asperger's has helped me out immensely. Plus the people who are close to me tell me they are 100% certain I have Asperger's. I want to get a formal diagnosis someday but for now just being aware that it is probably Asperger's has helped me out so much and I'm way better off than I was before. [info] None [info] 1518534420

OctoberOctoberaus [info] First time posting here It seems that the main group of bipolar is just filled with memes and such. So I thought I would post here instead.A little backstory of me: I was diagnosed with bipolar syndrome in mid-2015 I believe. Which took awhile for psychiatrists to figure out what it was. One said depersonalization, the other said psychosis. It was only later that the one psychiatrist and my family doctor to figure out what it was really was, bipolar.Now that I got out the way. I have many questions to ask. 1. Is it easy for someone with this mental illness to fall out of interest very quickly, like a hobby, or doing something on daily basis? 2. For someone that is on the basic meds, like lithium, how do you manage your weight? Because I do know a medication like lithium causes weight gain, but  it stabilizes your mood better than any medication out there. Mind you I also take a 3 week injection called 'fluexonal' (if I spelt that correctly). And finally 3. I know mine would be diffent from yours but, do you recall your actions when you were in a manic state like an episode? I sure hell don't remember mine at all.So lately, I've been trying to get my life back into gear after my fuck up's and recovering from episodes. I'm trying to kick alcohol out of my life, I've quit weed. I've been walking more to lose the weight. Recently taken a super part time job on the weekends to make some decent money.

trashytreebaby [info] Firstly there was the presence of both depressive episodes with manic episodes.Then when I started seeing a psychiatrist it came up that I have many of the other traits - risk taking behaviours, agitation, impulsiveness, reckless behaviour (ie: reckless spending) restlessness, self harm, delusional thoughts, problems with concentration, frenzied thoughts, all of which were far worse when I'm manic. I also experiance psychosis when manic so I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.There's a lot of good resources online, but at the end of the day seeing a doctor is your best bet. That way you can get on medication and get therapy, and trust me if you have bipolar disorder getting treatment will turn your life around. Finding a good psychiatrist and psychologist is essential. Finding meds that work can be a struggle but when you find the right ones you'll be shocked at how much better you feel. I didn't get diagnosed til I was 20 and I feel like when I got on medication I actually got to start living my life properly without my life being ruled by mental illness. I do have other issues that I'm working on but I feel so much more stable and like dealing with those other issues is possible.Treatment for mental illness is never easy but 110% worth it in the long run.

My Lutheran background informed me that I can identify Church by two tenets: whether Christ is preached via the Word, and whether the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper are administered.  If a congregation preaches Christ as described in the Bible-- the Son of God, our Savior, if the congregation can say that their teaching comes from the passing down from generation to generation and not merely pulled out of thin air, if the congregation offers the Sacraments, that is a good indicator that you belong there.  And you know, you belong to the true Church because you are baptised in the name of the Triune God.  The fact you care about belonging to Christ means that you \*do\* belong to Him.  My late husband and I opted for sterilization prior to marriage for medical and genetic reasons.  It was not an easy decision.  I thought we were selfish until events later in life unfolded.  I was diagnosed with bipolar I (which means I must take medicine that will affect fetal development) and my husband later suffered from dementia.  It was not an act of selfishness that we decided but it was instead an act of prudence.  Consider: your wife has a disease that requires her to take medicine.  You know her more than some guy who only has an encyclical in his hand.  Prudence is when you realise your wife would not be OK in various ways if she got pregnant.  I say that you are NOT selfish.  Ultimately, we all make decisions out of our limited finite minds.  God gave you reason to make sure you and your wife's wellbeing are intact.  We all will make error, but be comforted as we do live under the shadow of the Cross.  I hope this helps.Yours,Carol   [info] Smalcald Anglican (ACNA) [info] 1534600824
the_taraist [info] I thought about using a throwaway, but what the hell?I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 6 years before I started law school, but I was sick much longer prior to that.  I'm not sure what affect it has had on my performance, because I don't really know what law school is like without bipolar.  I've been relatively stable.  I'm a mediocre student, but I have a job I love, and I think the future looks pretty good.  My latest setback are panic attacks, which I have not experienced before this semester.  I think it is a combination of working 20 hours a week, plus full time classes- just the first time I've done that.I'm going to join everyone in saying that you're not alone.  The stigma is pretty bad, and depending on your state, you might have to disclose.  I disclosed bipolar on my application for character and fitness.  I had my interview a couple weeks ago, and the thing that really let me swim through was 1. I have not gotten in any legal troubles, and 2. I've never been hospitalized.  And how does a "crazy" person, like myself, pull that off?  Compliance with my treatment plan, and general good health habits like everyone has described here.  (Although I'm quite lax with certain things because I'd prefer not to stress over little details.)  Exercise is huge for me, though.So, I guess what I'm saying is its better to get help and disclose, than not get help for fear of disclosing. I realize you didn't mention that, but it was horrifying to me at first.  I talked to my ethics professor, though, who was a huge help.  We had some people give a presentation on mental health at school, and they said something like 10% of people have a mental illness or substance abuse problem when they start law school, and by 3L that number jumps to 40%.  People might not be talking - but they are in it.edit:typo [info] Esq. [info] 1384414147
chilly-wonka [info] Husband doesn't understand/agree with my diagnosis. Hypersexuality really complicates things. Advice for talking with him? **TLDR:** My husband doesn't think I have hypomanias, even though he comments on my symptoms and a lot of people around me see it. Also, it's hard to discuss past episodes that would help clarify it for him, because he's involved in most of the behaviors I regret, and I don't want him to feel guilty or attacked.  //After I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, it took me a while to tell my husband - he didn't really understand mental health issues for years and found the whole topic kind of weird. When I did tell him, he was surprised and said he didn't really see it. That was so weird for me to hear, because it was a lightning bolt moment for me that explained so much stuff from my past. I told my best friend from childhood, and she immediately said, "Oh, yup. Totally makes sense. Explains a lot." I told my sister, and she thought it was weird at first, but as we talked about it, she kept realizing more and more ways it matched up with my behavior. My husband is trying to be supportive, he wants to accept it. But it's hard for him when he doesn't feel like it's true, and it's hard for me to trust/communicate with him because that makes me insecure. My most recent hypomania seems SO clear-cut to me in retrospect. Lots of behavior that was different from normal - lots of energy, big projects, little sleep, talking fast, short-tempered, etc. I'm usually pretty lethargic, I avoid getting things done, I sleep a lot, I'm calm and laid-back, etc. Most of all, I was hypersexual. We had sex so many times that he said, "I'm so sorry honey, but you've worn me out sexually. I need a break for a few days!!" (Didn't think that was even possible)But (and here's where it gets complicated), I also slept with a couple other guys - with his knowledge and permission. He's a kinky bastard in general (which I love). For most of his wild ideas, I like them in fantasy, but would never do in reality. Until I'm hypo and then it seems like THE GREATEST IDEA EVER. I always feel shitty afterwards. Since getting diagnosed, I was 100% set on not repeating those behaviors, and felt like I could do that. Before this episode, it had been a few years since our last escapades, and we had talked about my regrets, and I explained that I wasn't interested in doing that kind of stuff anymore. He accepted that very graciously.Then this episode. A random guy started hitting on me and immediately I wanted to have sex with other men - one of his fantasies we'd talked about before (too much of a rabbit trail to explain here). I sexted with this guy for days, made plans to meet up for sex, and then he canceled on me. Pissed off and pent up, I went on craigslist, texted a couple guys, and jumped for the first one who responded. Hopped in the car and went to go fuck him, about half an hour after the idea popped into my head. This is so strange to write about even now, it doesn't sound or feel like me. I'm not an impulsive person at all. Again I'm pretty lethargic, and I think things through methodically and analytically before doing anything. And stable-me has no interest in fucking other men. But I did it multiple times because I kept wanting more, more, more. After the first guy, my husband wasn't even feeling it anymore, but I *needed more.* I feel gross thinking about it all.Anyway, how did my husband not see it? My boss, sister, and psychiatrist all noticed immediately (not on the sex stuff obviously, just my general mood/speech/behavior). My husband commented on or reacted to all of those behaviors - "Can't believe you're bouncing out of bed so early again!" "I can't understand you, could you talk slower?" - etc. etc., and of course he knew about the sex. He noticed all this, but still didn't get it. It's confusing. In past episodes, I've done other sexual things I regret very much, but he was involved or aware of all of them, and he liked it. To be clear, I don't judge him or hold him guilty in the slightest. I made those choices of my own volition and it isn't his fault. But I feel like talking about these experiences, and explaining them in the context of bipolar, would make it sound like I AM blaming him. *He* was of sound mind when they happened - so saying I did them because I was hypo, and that I regret them and would never do them otherwise... I just think it would make him feel like it's his fault. In one hypo episode, we decided to get pregnant right after getting married. In another, I asked him for a separation. All of these things are so tied up in our mutual lives, that I can't comment on my behavior without commenting on his, too. I just don't know how to talk about these things without him feeling judged or criticized. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1474426962

3ofCups [info] If you're in the US, you mentioned mental disorders, you can apply for services with the Division of Vocation Rehab (the name varies state to state I think), and they will help you with finding a job.At 21, even as a hs drop out, you're eligible for Job Corps until the age of 24. If you're still experiencing mental health issues, I highly recommend addressing them and working on your mental health recovery so that you are able to work. I say this because I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 my freshman year of high school. If I hadn't prioritized my mental health, I'd likely be on the streets or living at home with my parents in a toxic environment.  [info] None [info] 1515630026

AbrasiveArmadillo [info] Struggling with my Diagnosis I'm having a really hard time accepting my diagnosis. I know I've had some kind of mental illness probably close my whole life but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about two months ago. I fluctuate between thinking there is nothing wrong with me and thinking that I'm the cause of every problem I have ever had. I know that is the all or nothing thinking associated with bipolar disorder but sometimes I just don't believe it. I think I am driving my boyfriend crazy because I tell him I don't have anything wrong with me and he just glares at me. I sometimes hear voices, get really paranoid, and almost violent because I'm so scared. I'm not sure what else I could have but sometimes I feel like bipolar doesn't fit.

Hi-Im-No-One [info] Nmom refusing to support me (18) by any means, attempting to move out Hi all, I graduated earlier this year in May and took a semester break before starting college this coming January as I was an AP student in high school. I'm glad I waited now, because I may be moving three hours away due to my Nmom refusing to support me in any way, shape, or form.At age eleven I was diagnosed with bipolar type I and I have been stable for five years, something I'm immensely proud of. That stability is only kept intact because I never leave my bedroom now due to my mother. Recently I was running low on pills, and refilled them. The only thing my mom supported me with was my medicine, but today she refused to pay the copay. I live with my mother and retired grandmother, who is abused emotionally by my mother to the point of tears and suicidal ideation. I've recently entered a relationship with someone a little older than me with his own place, and he's taking me in if it works out alright.Am I right to leave? She doesn't buy me groceries, she doesn't support me financially, emotionally, or in any way. I don't want to leave my grandma with her but she says she can move into Section B housing, and if she does so I'll be left alone with my mother. If I stay with my mom my mental can and will be influenced. Even as I write this I'm burning incense behind a locked door with my two dogs and music. I never seriously considered leaving before but now that that last tie has been severed I have no reason to stay.I've been employed this whole time working overtime weekly until I quit that job last week over no hope for a raise or recognition and am starting a new job soon, although if I leave with the money from my final paycheck I won't be starting at all.Thanks for your time.

Butteredtoast57 [info] Will my illnesse progress from NOS diagnoses to bp 1 or 2 as i get older? During the summer of 2019 I was sent to the hospital for a manic episode were i was experiencing heavy paranoid delusions and almost every mania symptom that you can think of. Before the manic episode i was severely depressed for around 3 weeks then switched to hypomania which progressed to acute mania. I also was taking prozac which I was told triggered an underlying bipolar disorder. My uncle on my moms side has bipolar disorder and struggles with psychosis. I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS when i was 17. I recently turned 18. My main question is will this develop into a certain type of bipolar like 1 or 2 later in my life. I recently also got over another major depressive episode that lasted around 3 weeks aswell. Not sure if this is important but whenever i drink coffee i get hypomanic which only lasts for around a day. Besides this on medication (200mg lamictal and 5mg abilify) ive been relatively stable.

gr8dane95 [info] All Might from My Hero Academia.(Sorry for the long post and formatting, I'm on mobile)(And kinda drunk)When I first started watching the show I saw him and was like "ugh, just another perfect, overpowered character to satisfy the weaboos". But when I saw what he really was, I fell in love with the show. The exact moment I saw him in his "skeleton" form, I realized that he's exactly what I strive to be.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. It was rough, and it still is, but I'm doing my best to work with it. There are days where I feel weak and unable to do anything at all, and there are also days where I feel like a goddamn superhero. That's honestly just the duality of being bipolar, and I came to accept that after a long time of living through it. There will be ups and downs, probably ones that are more extreme than the average person, but hey... That's just the hand I've been dealt. Then I watched MHA. In the first episode or two it introduces All Might as this unbeatable monster of a hero (in the best way). Villians can't beat him, superheroes can't top him, and everyone around adores him. LAMEEEEEE. Sounded like a knock off Superman to me honestly.But then I saw his "skeleton" form..I had never related to a character more. He was so weak. So frail. So broken. He wasn't always that symbol of peace everyone thought he was. Hell, the majority of the time he was weak and unable to do anything at all, but regardless of the odds, he still fought with strength and a smile so that others were encouraged to stand alongside him.I'd like to think that's the kind of person I am.My illness does hold me back. I'm fully aware of that. I can never be a happy, fulfilling adult. But I'll be damned if I don't give 110% and use that 110% to inspire people to fight even harder. That's what All Might did. Kinda.

I was diagnosed with bipolar half way through, I was extremely lucky to have that extra support.My parents are a lot older than most and know that they won't be alive to support me and my sister if the shit hits the fan hence why they doing everything they can to set us up now. I'll likely be their care takers in what's hopefully more than a decade's time. I'm 24, they're in their early 70's. I'm pretty sure my dad's starting to show early signs of Alzheimer's, Mum refuses to believe me and puts it down to a silent stroke he had several years ago.

KitsuneGeisha [info]   I’m almost 30 with Bipolar I. I have 2 boys ages 7 and almost 2. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having my first child. I have experienced severe mood episodes both times postpartum, so that is something to keep in mind. Depending on what you take medication wise, you may have to add or remove meds for pregnancy and afterwards.   Because of my mental state, I know now that I cannot handle having anymore children. My mania after my second was bad enough I should have been hospitalized. Because I have my two boys, I work really hard to never miss my meds.

khaosnmt [info] I'm a bit late to this one, but I've been trying to figure out how I want to tell this story. Wall of text incoming.I went to apply for summer and fall classes last week, and both my advisor and the associate Dean of students told me that I should give up on getting my degree because I'm obviously not trying hard enough. I have had the last two years of hell dealing with family and personal health problems, and that apparently means nothing to them.They told me that I am too far in debt (the only point they made that I agree with, by the way. $100k is a lot), and that I am too far behind and lack the focus and dedication to ever finish my degree. They have all the doctor's paperwork and notes to show that I wasn't skipping out on classes, so that's not the problem. To me, the problem is that they only want my money and their certifications, and me failing and dropping classes is screwing up their certification numbers.I plan on transferring to an online school soon. That way I can do shit on MY TIME and deal with everything else.Background below:I am adopted. My parents adopted me late in their lives. I was 6 weeks old (so I'm told). My mother is currently 74; my father is 70. I am 23.Both of them have COPD and my father's is end stage. I am a full time college student trying to get a bachelor's in information technology at a probably the most known school in my state. As such, it's a difficult school to attend.Lately, both parents have been having health issues. Both have the beginning stages of dementia (although my mother won't admit it). I have been back and forth countless times in the last two years making sure they are taken care of. It's a 3 hour drive one way. I am my father's only child, and one of four for my mom (her youngest, in fact). My brothers never call, but one of them lives 30 minutes from her and visits for lunch occasionally. Mom still works full time because it's the only way she can pay her bills.I live paycheck to paycheck. I go to school full time, and I work full time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and type 2 diabetes last year. (Thank you biological parents and genetics...)Two years ago when this all started, I talked to my instructors about missing classes because Mom ended up in the hospital. I ended up dropping out that semester to take care of her. Last semester, I had hell because of all of the tweaking and testing the doctors had to do to get me stable on my medications. I failed a class and passed the others. One was a passing grade, but not enough for my degree requirements. I missed about a month of classes this semester because Dad ended up in the hospital and then a nursing home for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Being his power of attorney, I had to be there to deal with the paperwork and money. If you actually read all of that, thank you. I needed to get this out. [info] None [info] 1461446185
BaliHaiCR [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2. I take lamotrigine for mood stabilization, which has served me well since diagnosis and I have no plans to stop taking it. Probably the biggest benefit I get from the addition of kratom is my alcoholism (4+ drinks per day) and daily cannabis use ceased immediately after discovering kratom. I still enjoy drinking and a little toke on occasion, but my general life experience and world outlook are greatly improved since discovering kratom over a year ago. Now I'm in full control of my alcohol and cannabis use. Very grateful for this plant. May I ask what antipsychotic you take? For a brief period I took quetiapine, which did not react well with kratom.&amp;#x200B;Interesting article, and maybe we'll soon discover more and greater benefits for people with serious mental disorders.

H3LL0FRI3ND_exe_file [info] When someone is better than you at something I’m not diagnosed with NPD, but I think you can have some nice inputs on what I’m about to tell you. I’m quite the athletic type. I played soccer/football for many years and I was the best player. I constantly dominated on the field and my father, my teammates and my teammates’ parents always complimented me and basically I was a star in the community. Everybody knew who I was and what I was capable of. However, I eventually started to hate football and I wanted to quit, but everybody kept pushing me to keep going, even though I didn’t want to. My mental health started to decline and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I quit playing football and started focusing on school. I have good grades, but I don’t get straight A’s. Working hard has been difficult because of my diagnosis and also because I started having flashbacks of an incident. My grandmother sexually abused me and I believe it has scarred me. It changed me into a different person. Anyway, I’ll get to what I really wanted to talk about. Whenever someone does something better than me, I become angry. Not at myself, but at them, because they are living proof that I’m not the best at that particular thing. I often have this feeling that I can do better than everyone else and that I deserve praise and special treatment because of it. So when someone I consider lesser than me do betterthan me at something, then I get angry and think «how dare they do better than me when I did a pretty good job»? I have to be the best, but they prove that I’m not. I hate that. I also get angry at my teachers if they give a grade I’m not satisfied with. Can you relate? [info] None [info] 1548974894

boodleb [info] I need some reddit social support, is there any hope for me? Even when I explain my situation in life, I'm in a bit of disbelief Ecuador no one can have this much bad luck. Unfortunately, it's all true. I'm 18 and in my 3rd yer of college. Last year my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He is not on his death bed, but is far from the man he used to be and is in and out of hospital, our home life is completely different. About a month ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar and am on various meds and battling with this all the time. I miss a lot of college and as a result, just an average student. I try my best but with given circumstances, it's difficult to give it my all as it no longer seems the most important thing. My mum told me the other day that she will be quitting her work to look after dad and so we won't have much money anymore. I frequently worry that I will no longer be able to fulfil much realistically. I know people say that no matter what, if you work hard you'll get what you want. The reality is, I would have to stay at home if I wanted to go to uni, I also find it unlikely that I'll get good grades or a job because if my own mental health. I guess I'm looking for reassurance. Am I pretty screwed? Is there anywhere I can go in today's day and age without a degree? Is this just my life from now on! [info] None [info] 1396542767
OctupleSnake [info] My most intense episode yet I'd like to preface this with a little background. I was diagnosed with bipolar psychosis about six months ago but ive been dealing with it for years.  I am 21 years old and have only recently began treatment/therapy. My tharapist told me it might be good to reach out to a group of people who can relate to me so here i am.I woke up with a staticky feeling in my head and a slight feeling of panic. I was confused but I tried to disregard it. However, this feeling persisted throughout my morning, like a veil between my mind and the world. In addition, the feeling seemed to be growing, further distancing me from reality. But despite my disassociation, I still had things to do. I kept going about my day as if I were completely grounded. Around two o'clock I went to an appointment with my psychiatrist. I tried in vain to describe the still growing feeling within me. I left, feeling more overloaded than before. On my drive back, I contemplated this feeling that had plagued me for hours. But the more I thought about it the worse it got. Until I finally realized, that the staticky feeling in my head was actually a bunch of voices. A sea of voices that had been murmuring to each other in the back of my head all day. At that point, all hell broke loose. I had opened the floodgates and everything was spilling out. The voices grew louder, and louder as if someone were turning up the volume. They became deafening, but I still couldn't make out what they were saying, there were too many. The voices had drowned out the music in my car and at this point, I became acutely aware of a feeling. That feeling of panic, the feeling of being overloaded. It was because I was exactly that. Overloaded, overwhelmed by emotions. Thousands of them, as if I were feeling the individual emotions of thousands of people. I began to get flashes of images. They came like waves, in swathes. They were so fast and numerous that I couldn't make them out. It was like I was seeing the memories and experiences of the same crowd of the same people. The images I was seeing were combating what I saw in front of me, I.e the road. Like two inputs battling for the same screen. I pulled over while I still had some grasp on reality and lost my grip further. I think I left the car but I can't be sure, I had lost track of what was real. It felt like I was floating above a crowd of people, stretching as far as I could see. I was losing it, I had to find a way back. So I closed my eyes and I focused on something, anything that could ground me. What I received was her. I could feel her presence, her warmth, her embrace. It felt like a force, calling me home. I held onto that feeling, concentrated on it. There was a ringing in my ear, it drowned out the voices. I opened my eyes. Everything was suddenly quiet. I was in a room, a peaceful room with sunlight shining through the window. I opened my eyes again. I was in my bedroom, the blinds were closed. What time was it? Had I ever even left? It was four thirty and there was a prescription slip on my desk, along with a card for my next appointment. I have been off my medicine for at least three days. Though, it's probably been more like a week. I have had episodes like this before. But never this intense. All I know is, I need to refill my prescription. [info] None [info] 1552029332
ChalenesEvilTwin [info] What really fucks with me is that it makes me question my own disability. I am diagnosed with bipolar, on disability and constantly struggling to reengage with society. But am I really sick, or am I just one of "those" people? Am I just blowing my own issues out of proportion or do I legitimately need and/or deserve (to the extent that anyone deserves anything, which is arguable...) the help that I'm getting? Am I jumping on the trendy bandwagon? I really don't want to believe that about myself, but I'm sure no one else does either.I think people with actual gender dysphoria must feel the same way. This "trend" is just diluting and taking away attention from their legitimate struggle, and turning it into a joke. It's awful.Edit because apparently I can't spell dysphoria.

RAGE-RAGE-RAGE [info] For some people it does seem to be a 180 flip, completely unexpected. That's what people said about me until I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder recently. "But you seemed so happy!" I guess I should take that as a compliment to my acting.Honestly, we can never know every individuals reason for suicide, but I can try and shed a little light on things.Sometimes people just get tired of fighting. Life seems like an upward struggle, but they keep going until one day they ask themselves why. Why are they doing this if it hurts so much? Some people have an answer. Because of my kids, my dog, my wife, my husband etc. But sometimes there is no answer. They are unable to find a reason to live, and they think there must be one, at least one thing to keep going for, and yet they still find nothing. Sometimes this is a slow realization, but often it can be sudden, but equally as devastating in either case. Sorry if this doesn't answer your questions. [info] None [info] 1382177536
yourfrootloopdingus [info] How sneakers have changed my life and helped me deal with mental illness I was always the fat girl growing up. I was bullied my whole life for what I looked like. I never felt I was truly able to be myself and was always hiding behind ugly clothes and a fake smile. When I was older I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and with help got on the right medication and therapy. Once I finally felt "myself" enough to be confident in who I was I found kicks. I don't have the luxury of wearing all the clothes I like because of my size, but with shoes I can pick up from what everyone else can. Through sneakers I found I could express myself and not have to compromise based on what is available to me. It seems silly but at the end of the day I'm just happy I can buy the same shoes that a size 0 can. Of course sneakers don't cure the underlying issues that contribute to my weight or bipolar disorder but they remind me that I'm worthy of feeling confident in my skin. [info] None [info] 1528257377
jncummins86 [info] Although I appreciate the sentiment, I can say with all honesty I have no alternatives than to keep taking what I’m on. I have been diagnosed with bipolar since 2009. This year is the first time I’ve ever tried lithium and this is the first time in my entire life that I am feeling “normal” emotional range. Unfortunately, given all I went through these past two years and the consequences of trying pregnancy safe alternatives after the no meds at all attempt, I am certain I will attempt suicide if I get that low again. On the flip, I am almost certain I will lose my marriage with the next extreme mania. Lithium can do a lot of harm during pregnancy. But I’m told by both my psych APRN and my OBGYN that through monitoring more regularly and closely and maintaining my health otherwise it is possible to deliver a happy healthy baby with no side effects from it. TBH, I’m amazed at how calm I have been posting this and responding... each passing day I realize more how much it’s important for me to stay on my meds the way they are.I hope you are able to find what works for you. It’s almost as unhealthy TTC while mentally unstable as it is to be on meds that MAY have effects... the struggle to know what’s best for you is real. Much love to you. [info] None [info] 1573431262

DeepDee [info] I know that life. I was diagnosed with bipolar after I stopped drinking. I think the main thing to keep in mind is that happiness is the wrong goal. Life is about waking up every morning and working hard. Doing what need to be done and living a virtuous life.The main things that keep me from being down are nature, art (music), and philosophy. They're all impartial and can help you stay balance, especially emotionally. Life can be hard, but drinking only makes it harder. [info] None [info] 1532162091
oh-hi-doggy [info] Disgruntled ex is accusing me of child abuse and untreated bipolar disorder Wisconsin, USAMy ex "Dad" and I were together for 4.5 years consisting of many ups and downs.  Our relationship ended in August 2015.  Together we have a child "Son" who is 4 years old. Dad lives and works in a different state but only three hours away.  Dad lives with his brother in a shared 1 bedroom apartment in a big city.  Dad sleeps on the couch.  I just completed school and live in a two bedroom apartment in a small community.  I have our son most of the time, with Dad taking him every other weekend and lately almost every holiday (so I can work).  Son has his own bedroom and goes to a daycare on a daily basis.I was diagnosed with bipolar type II 1 year before I met Dad.  I'd been hospitalized and treated.  I haven't seen a psychiatrist since Jan 2011 and no longer see counseling or take medications.  I have not needed to seek treatment for my mental health since 2011.I started a relationship with "Boyfriend" in early November.  Boyfriend is starting to play a large part in my life and spends a lot of nights sleeping over.  Boyfriend doesn't show too much affection to me in front of son.  Boyfriend has never met Dad before.Son has regularly been seeing Dad and talking to him on the phone 3 - 4 x per week.  Sometimes I talk to Dad and he gets upset about our failed relationship and calls me names.  He turns around and says he still loves me and wants me to give him another chance.  Son told Dad about Boyfriend on Wednesday Jan 6 on the phone, saying how Boyfriend and Son have recently watched Star Wars together.  Dad demanded to speak to me and immediately began questioning.  I told Dad Boyfriend's name and basic information.  Dad called me a "Selfish disgusting bitch" and "You're confusing him!"  I've tried calling Dad back to explain the situation, that I'd like for all of us including boyfriend to be able to sit down together and discuss how we should go about this.  Dad won't contact me and hasn't tried to contact me or our son since.This morning a sheriff arrived at my door with paperwork from Dad's lawyer accusing me of child abuse "bruises to thighs and buttocks" and unstable mental state "untreated, diagnosed bipolar type II and suicidal ideations."  Dad never contacted CPS or the cops in regard to any bruises.  Son did have bruises on his legs due to a fall from rough-housing days before he saw Dad. Dad wants son 100%.I want to continue joint custody with Dad.  Our Son deserve his Dad in his life.  I just graduated from nursing school.  I have 0 debt and I do not want to start acquiring it through lawyer fees.  I can't have allegations of child abuse on my record especially with the degree I have and jobs I'm seeking.Should I attempt to settle this outside of court?  Should I now aim to have our child 100% now that he's making these false allegations?Edit: Dad and I were never married even though the tag says divorce.Edit 2: parents have offered to help me pay for a lawyer.  Court date set early feb will update. [info] None [info] 1452534171
01000101000001 [info] I'm still trying to decide on if I should do it. Throw away for obvious reasons.I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic features this time last year. I was on seroquel and abilify which worked when I was living with my mom but it made me sleep close to 14 hours a day. My doctor made me continue the meds and my therapist left me to go to another clinic. I could never do anything productive on my meds and I don't want my life to go back to that. I discontinued the medicine after my therapist left and things just keep getting worse. I'm failing most of my classes...I was a 4.0 student. I'm going to lose my scholarship. I have no savings. I'm paying off a car and I have no job.I want to commit suicide. I have a plan.I just don't know if I can. I don't know what is holding me back at this point.I don't think my mental health will ever be better. I'm not sure why I'm posting this honestly.

I have not sought to target individuals or groups. All people around me have been affected by my behaviour during these episodes.I have been dealing with alcohol addiction and mental health issues. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia and have struggled to deal with that. This is not an excuse, but it hopefully means I can get better.To try and work through this I am seeking help and will be attending rehabilitation and therapy in the coming weeks. I am truly sorry to the people that have been affected by my behaviour. Many thanks to my friends and family for helping me through this.

Incantationess [info] Banned from your house? Well so is my son. *trigger warning about suicide*Hey neighbors, there's been some crazy stuff happening to me and I wanted some advice. Here's some background. A few weeks ago I tried to kill myself. I took 4 bottles of Xanax and a bottle of muscle relaxers in hopes that I'd be taken painlessly from this world. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and borderline personality disorder and couldn't afford my meds so I tried to end it all. I have an 18mo son who wasn't involved in the situation at all. I am honestly surprised I wasn't killed driving and running all red lights. I feel awful that I even put people in a situation where they could possibly get hurt. I talked to 5 different medical personnel and took myself into a psyche ward. I was immediately released as they didn't see anything wrong with me. (4 bottles deep y'all, I blacked out). My husband tried restraining me and I beat him. So I got a domestic battery in the 3rd degree charged. This was a 3 day suicidal rampage. On the last day I wrote a little suicide note and took all of my pills. I threw some up and fell to the floor. my MIL found me in my puke pile, called for ambulance, and it's been crazy since. She banned me from her house. I've been picking up the pieces like going to court, counseling, etc. I spent 6 days in a psyche ward. I sent my 18mo to a different state with my family so my husband and I can work some stuff out. I feel empty. Nobody is taking this seriously. This wasn't a "cry for help". This was a real life suicide attempt and nobody is trying to help me. I'm being chastised everywhere I look. I'm damned if I do. I'm damned if I don't. There is no upside for me. My MIL hates me and won't lift the ban off of me going to her house. So I decided that if I'm banned from going to her house, then so is my son. Simple as that. But my husband doesn't agree and neither does my MIL of course. What do I do? I can't even take care of myself right now. I don't need all of this added drama.*edit*- I live with my husband and son. MIL lives about a street away so she was able to make it to our house pretty quick. [info] None [info] 1576778933
BreakingMyInsides [info] Hi, I'm not much older than you (21 year old, master's level graduate), but I was diagnosed with bipolar II around the same age. Been involuntarily committed about a year ago, came out, graduated with honors, went onto a graduate program, graduated again with honors. Had a very serious manic phase where I was having a bout of paranoia (i.e., when the apocalypse comes, dinosaur heads will be the new currency, so I went about collecting them), and a few "less serious" manic phases in which I got four tattoos in less than 3 months. Ask away. [info] BP2/borderline [info] 1536880387
lulukodiak [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I feel like I relate to borderline a lot more. Borderline mood shifts usually happen quicker/more frequent so within a day you go from manic to depressed rather than a few days of each. My doc says I should keep doing therapy and meds for a while before getting ahead of myself on switching diagnosis. So I guess we’ll see, I feel like bipolar and borderline go hand in hand. If you have one you probably have tendencies of the other imo.  [info] None [info] 1550547212
Kedestria [info] I've been with my fiance for 2 1/2 years, and known each other for 4 1/2. I'm diagnosed with bipolar, and we suspect that he may have it as well. Relationships can most definitely be hard with mental illness, but just like relationships without mental or physical problems, it's something both sides have to be willing to work with. There will always be issues in relationships. I'm currently unmedicated and I get pretty wild on both spectrums, but he's stuck with me through all of it. The nights of breakdowns and self-harm where all I can do is cry and the days of irritability and invincibility and flying off the walls. We've seen each other at our worst and we know we can keep doing what we've been doing. I love my man deeply and wouldn't change him for the world, and I know he feels the same way about me. So while it can take awhile to find someone who will stay with you and love you for who you are, it's not impossible and it's definitely worth the search.

Jew_With_a_Knife [info] Seconding the mental issues! I'm admittedly a really picky eater (although nowhere near as bad as OP's bf), and after YEARS of struggling with that (and a plethora of other issues) I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My psychiatrist told me that picky eating and issues with food textures can often be related to disorders such as bipolar and borderline.That being said, with encouragement from my therapist and psychiatrist it is something I'm actively working on. But even before I got help I would have NEVER limited my partner to my shitty diet. That was my burden and mine alone, I've always known that it's an irrational behavior. Wanting to control your partner's diet like that hints at more than just food issues.Honestly OP, you should stand up for yourself! Eat whatever the fuck you want, and tell him that he needs serious psychiatric help for his control and food issues. [info] None [info] 1443211275

cmark88 [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and ADHD, so I know a little bit about what you're going through. People that haven't experienced how these medications make people feel can lack empathy. When I was on medication, I feel like I lost all drive to be empathetic, when normally I am extremely so. The lack of empathy made it so I didn't care at all that I was failing out of college my second semester and wasting my parents' money, when normally that would have caused me a great deal of stress and guilt and shame.Since that time, I've been able to complete college and a graduate degree thanks be to God. I haven't been on lamictal for 8+ years now, and off of adderol for 4+ years. Instead of continuing down a path of trying to medicate everything, my urge would be to seek help from a qualified professional counselor. One that won't jump to medication as the first option. Be honest with yourself though, you need help. You need prayer. You need wise counsel. You need friends/pastors/family that understand and empathize with you, but who also won't allow you to make excuses for poor behavior.Edit: also, I urge you brother to remember that our Holy Spirit is a Spirit of self-control. It will be tempting to be compulsive while you are manic. You will feel the urge surging through you like a train engine to be compulsive and explosive in some way. Pray. Resist. Call on trusted friends to pray with you. [info] Christian. Evangelical. Reformed. [info] 1475523655
anjagladidontxist [info] Decline in language For the past year and a half or so (maybe longer, this is how long I’ve observed) my grasp over language has been in a steady decline. Normally, this wouldn’t be too much of a problem but I plan on becoming a professor of English and this could be disastrous if it’s allowed to continue. My grammar is the one that’s declined the most. Earlier, I used to be very sure of what was right and what isn’t and now I just draw a blank. It makes me unexplainably frustrated and angry because writing and language is what defines me as a person. It’s not just language; I haven’t been able to study and the number of times I’ve broke down crying because I couldn’t understand what was going on with me is innumerable. I used to be a straight A student and now? I literally took a W on winter term and then didn’t go back for fall. Essentially, I haven’t been in college for a year. I don’t think it’s too surprising that this timeline coincides with my diagnosis, decline of mental health and then slow healing. In 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar II and I’ve had several breakdowns since then. I’ve been hospitalized numerous times and it’s only since this summer has it gotten even the slightest bit better. Does anyone have any tips? I can’t live like this. It makes me feel so inadequate (I had to literally look up “inadequate” because I forgot what the word for not feeling up to par was. Fml) [info] None [info] 1543476854
Katielynn92 [info] Personally, I would want to see how the medication works or see how things go without getting a bipolar diagnosis first. There is just something about the stigma of mental illness labels that can be very damning. I don't say this to scare. I had mental issues for ten years before I got the real diagnosis as bipolar 2. My general practitioner had just always said I was just depressed and put me on Zoloft. The Zoloft threw me into manic episodes. Explaining the effects of it to my psychiatrist later was part of what helped determine my true diagnosis also. But years later when I got the Bipolar diagnosis and now have career changes, it messes with that. See, I'm studying criminal justice and the bipolar official diagnosis on my record can prevent me from having certain jobs. There is a definite stigma and label that come with an official diagnosis on your record. So your doctors just may be wanting to be careful of putting that official diagnosis on you and they may be trying to be very careful before they make any big judgements that can affect you for a long time. Lamictal/Lamitogrine (sorry for the spelling) was what I started out with when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I titrated up very slowly. Those are mood stabilizers. This medication works extremely well for a lot of people, I just happened to be one of the few it didn't work well for at all. There's different "categories" of medications for people with bipolar. Stabilizers like lamictal are usually what doctors start you off with and then they slowly move in another direction such as antipsychotics (latuda, seroquel). I'm on seroquel now which is great (except the weight gain which I'm on topamax to counteract).  I do think it would be wise to try the medications and see if it helps move you towards a happier life. I felt so validated with a diagnosis knowing i wasn't crazy with all my mood swings. But with the stigma that came with my official diagnosis I almost wish I hadn't gotten diagnosed to be honest. Just my thoughts. You can always try a second opinion from another doctor bI wish you SO much luck! [info] None [info] 1458804696

russlo [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder II. I'm medicated all the time. It's not been an easy life to get me to this point, but I try to be grateful for what I have. I've met a lot of people, and probably not "the most ungrateful person I know", but definitely deserving of mention, is a little son of a bitch 13 year old brother of an ex-girlfriend, named Mikey. Mikey got every single thing he ever wanted via tantrums, threats, and destruction of property and relationships. I'm not kidding. For instance, I would casually chat with him about video games, and he had every console I had ever wanted and some I didn't. His nephew, my ex's boy Vinnie, was just starting to play video games. I gave Vinnie my Gameboy (can't remember what version, I never played it that much, but I had a couple of the Pokemon games for it, and some other pretty sweet stuff that Vinnie enjoyed playing) and he started playing video games too. Happy, great kid. However, Vinnie also idolized his uncle, and would take many, many of his bad attitudes and behaviors and copy them and they would come out at the absolute worst times. He once threatened to stab us both (his mom and I) one morning. That wakes you up fast.At around this point, I had been dating her for a period of about 6+ months, and she was just starting to work me into her family life as she didn't know how I would react or fit. I had met her diabetic, do-nothing, abusive father, whom she had taken into her home for about a month in the beginning of the relationship in an attempt to help him out. I met her neurotic, sweet, yet ultimately incredibly distrusting mother, as well as both of her mother's boyfriends that she had during the time period when I was dating this ex. I met Mikey one night when it was us, Vinnie, Mikey's spoiled-ass friend who we'll call Josh, and mother's boyfriend #2 (who got her name tattooed on his arm - classy!). This sets the stage.I'm standing in the kitchen, literally asking the mom if I could help with anything, and Mikey starts whining about something, and I just had enough just from seeing and hearing him that evening. I turned and looked at him and told him off, something to the effect of "Seriously kid, when I was younger, I would've gotten a beating for saying half the stuff you do." So Mikey looks at me and says "What are you sayin', you want to beat me up?" And playing and stuff like he's punching me... then he starts actually punching me... so I start deflecting that. Then his friend Josh comes up behind me and tries to trip me. I kept my feet, and pushed this kid to the floor hard enough that he didn't mess with me for a while - he was basically laying there stunned on the linoleum. Mikey sees this and tries to run past the dining room table, but I grab him in a bear hug, lift him up to shoulder height, and start swinging him around like a god damned rag doll back into the kitchen. Then I put him on my shoulder, and just jumped up and down a few times with his chest hitting off mine and his stomach getting banged by my shoulder, again, just treating him like a rag doll. Then I took him off my shoulder, held him by his scrawny legs, and pretended several times like I was going to drop him right on his face onto the kitchen floor.Mind you, his entire family watched this and laughed their asses off, from start to finish. Which all tells you something about Mikey, his family, and the incredible bullet dodging that occurred that night on both her part and mine.So then, I did drop him, but only from about calf height, and he crumpled into the fake tiles. I turned around and went back to his friend Josh, and literally just FAT BOY'ed his ass - I laid right on top of him. I was tired and I don't normally lift a 13 year old football player up and down a few times then smash him (softly) into a floor. It was the most dominating thing I could think to do to him without physically exerting myself too much in case there was a round 2 with Mikey. So I laid there on Josh and asked him if he wanted anymore. I said if he wanted anymore, I was right there. He could just take a swing (all his limbs were pinned by my massive bulk). I saw shortly after getting up that Mikey had crawled behind the couch and was weeping like a little girl. We all laughed at him and his friend the rest of the evening, and dinner continued as if nothing had happened besides the occasional glances from Mikey and his friend at me. Very well mannered that night.Thus, I bullied the bullies. His mom used to threaten them when they were misbehaving that she was going to have me come over and kick their asses again. I heard that worked for a while, even after the ex and I broke up. **TL/DR:** I lived the dream, and got to "beat up" the most spoiled little shithead I knew at the time, *with* his family's approval.

theendofthisroad123 [info] Hello fellow bipolar personI hope you are doing well, I know full well how difficult it is to live with bipolar. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 late 2015 and I've been trying to recover ever since.Personally I wouldn't write off going to the government psychologist. A couple of months ago I was going to clinical psychology regularly at RIPAS after my manic episode till she basically said that I was okay. It helped me a bit with coming down from mania. I saw her roughly once a month for about ten months. It didn't feel like it was enough initially, but after a while as I got progressively better i didn't feel like I needed to see her that much.  Personally I take medication to control my bipolar and for me it has helped immensely in controlling my moods, I wouldn't be able to live my life fully without it. I see a psychiatrist at RIPAS on regular basis for my bipolar which helps me a lot.  [info] None [info] 1485952829
pretty_annoying_tbh [info] How do you cope with being in your 20s and 30s without ever having been in a relationship? My story is that I am 30 years old, am straight, and I have never been in a relationship with a girl in my life. I have been on a total of 4 dates (even that is stretching the truth a little when it comes down to how to exactly define a "date"), have never kissed a girl sober, and have only ever had sex with prostitutes (quite a few over a relatively short period of time).  From the age of 25-29 I felt very lonely and grew extremely depressed. I was diagnosed with bipolar by a number of doctors and psychiatrists, though I was in denial for at least a year until I saw how much medication and therapy helped me. Now, starting only from about a month ago, for whatever reason, I have stopped worrying about being single. I work full time for a low-end salary but I love my job and when I am not working I read everything I can about science (mostly biology and genetics) which I have wanted to be able to do since as long as I can remember but have always felt I lacked the intelligence (again the low self esteem thing). I am not an attractive man by any stretch, in fact I seem to have inherited a plethora of genetic quirks that come part and parcel with a northern European heritage. I am very conscious to not judge people superficially and would happily date a lady who was overweight or not deemed "pretty" by conventional standards (whatever they are). In fact I find a certain kind of "ugliness" very appealing maybe because it often equates to a unique and interesting personality. Long boring story aside, how many other redditors are in their late 20s, but more specifically, those of you in your early 30s have surrendered to the idea of never being in a relationship? How does this make you feel and do you believe it to be genuine? For me personally, I would much prefer to dedicate the rest of my life to doing something good like curing a disease or discovering new things about the human brain than wasting years in vain to snag some woman who probably won't be that into me. I know I am missing out in a big way to not experience love, but I get the feeling that I missed that boat and my absolute lack of experience with women leaves me at a hopeless disadvantage.**TL;DR - 30 years old and considering a life without relationships.

Meowjin [info] I want to leave Canada in a year to move to Australia. I need to save at least 1k a month but I can't stop spending money and I need tips on how to not spend! I'm terrible at these type of posts but essentially my current income take home is $2800 a month which will get increased in 3 months to ~ $3200 after I complete 8 weeks of skills training (where I will collect EI).I really hate it where I live.  I'll be turning 28 this month and I can't stand another day being idle and not seeing whats out there.   Originally my intention was to finish my ticket here (will be a 3rd year after this term), then travel, but I'm worried that by the time I get my ticket I'll be 30 and I'll lose my opportunity and my youth to see the world.I wont have any debt.  (I just filed 3 years of taxes, and the return I'm getting will wipe my Canada Student Loan debt clean).  I don't have any expenses (I own my home), my cellphone bill is 40 a month and my vehicle is no more than 200 a month and I can get by on eatting chicken breast, rice and protein vitamin mix and easily eat for 40 dollars a week.    My problem is I go out alot because I hate staying at home and I'll eat alot, then stop at starbucks and get a giant ice coffee, see some clothing/shoes that I think look awesome and buy them on a whim, or i'll snack, or i'll splurge at the bar, or go on some dates with some girls, which causes me to be dead broke.To hear my coworkers today say how glad they would be to be in my situation (most pay mortgages and obviously make more) and yet they manage to still save money and have a nice lifestyle just goes to show you how bad I am with money.  My impulse control sucks (I am diagnosed with bipolar/ADHD) and I know there is something I can do to tell myself to save money.There should be no reason that I shouldn't be able to save at least 1k a month if not MORE.  I just don't know how to train myself to not spend money on such useless shit that adds nothign to my life (except maybe to my waist line).   I know that I need at least 12 grand for Australia, should give me enough to be unemployed and get settled there and have a sizeable emergency fund if I have to leave Canada.  Even if my plan fizzles out by the end of the year I can have a large savings fund to get somewhere. Please help reddit! [info] None [info] 1420710913
its_prin [info] Motivation How do you get the motivation to get out of bed, brush your teeth, shower, clean your house, potty train your toddler, etc? I have taken high-dose Adderall XR for 10 years my pits were sweaty my mouth was dry but I had some gumption. A year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and my Adderall didn't work with my Lithium 900mg.  So now I am on 54mg of Concerta and I am always frustrated, angry, and stuck. I know that you shouldn't rely on medication to get going. I just don't know where to start. I've tried to just do it for 15, 10, 5,3 minute increments and nothing. I deleted FB to try at see if that helped. But nothing so far, so I joined redit to seek some help. [info] None [info] 1545089664
Affectionate_Leading [info] Yes, absolutely. Not that all happenings of mental illnesses are caused by demons, but I'm sure some are. Also, I'm not religious myself, but angels, demons, psychics, Intuition, Twin Flames, the Divine, are all Spiritual things, which is way different because they all contribute to the Truth which is unwritten, but witnessed. With religion, it seems the paradigm is often that it's written, but rarely witnessed, if ever. Anyway, the demon, or demons, that I'm dealing with, keep causing me to feel sad. I was diagnosed with bipolar, I think 5 years ago, maybe 6, and at this point it's not even a problem anymore. I know the demonic influence is what's causing my sadness at this juncture of my life. The only thing I don't know exactly is why it was put on me in the first place. [info] Claircognizance [info] 1522686970
jamie_jamie_jamie [info] TL;DR- A horrible hallucination and a dead guy under a train.Most terrifying would be one of my hallucinations. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II and a symptom is hallucinations. I was living out of home with my boyfriend, we were laying in bed and I was trying to sleep but the streetlights were bright and we had shitty blinds. Our bed is parallel to the wardrobe which had mirrors for the doors and at the end of our bed was the TV. I was facing the wardrobe with my head on his chest, and I kid you not, there was a pale woman behind me just sitting there staring at the TV in the reflection. She was in a white torn up nightgown kind of thing with long stringy, oily black hair, and her skin looked like she was covered in bruises. I turned around to look behind me and I couldn't see her but when I turned to look at the mirror again I saw her again. It scared the fuck out of me. My boyfriend who has hallucinations as well helped me get through the fear. Now I know that it's all in my head and can't hurt me, but having my first one was horrible.The other thing was that I mum and I saw cop cars hanging around the train station near our place, so being the sticky beaks that we were, we drove down to have a look, as we were driving past I looked under the train because curiosity, and for about 10 metres there were human remains. Turns out the guy was walking on the tracks with headphones in and didn't hear the freight train that killed him. [info] None [info] 1482921327
curio-cat [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 over 10 years ago.  I usually don't tell my boss or coworkers because of stigmas.  Recently my pdoc and I have been working on my medication so I've had to have doctors appointments monthly.  I ended telling my boss, who I completely trust, about my disability and that I will be having a lot of doctor appointments until my meds are stable again.  It doesn't sound like you should tell your boss, like I did, but maybe talk to your pdoc about your situation and see what he/she says.  Your boss has no right to know about your disorder.

RogueVenus [info] I'm really tired, but, I'm going to try to tell this story in a way that makes sense :)I used to hate being single. HATE IT. From the time I had my first boyfriend, I wanted male companionship. So... I partied. I drank too much, and ended up in relationships with men who drank too much, and all we did was drink and fight. Fast forward - I'm 26, slowly killing myself. Eventually it got to be too much. I ended up in rehab, where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.**Now, I am in no way implying that your emotional situation is so severe, but this is the part of the story that I want you to pay attention to:**I realized, while in therapy, that no one could make me feel better but myself. AND - This is important, too - I couldn't give myself everything I needed if I was looking after someone else. So I took some time off.For 3 years, it was just me. At first, the lonliness hurt so bad I thought I was going to die. It hurt to sleep alone, it hurt to wake up alone. So... I started to distract myself. I went to the movies, but since I was going by myself, I had to choose for myself. I watched TV and chose my own shows. I read books, and no one was looking over my shoulder, judging my choices. Slowly, I started devloping tastes and interests that I never knew I had.Then, one day, I realized... I wasn't loney any more. My own company was enough. And that was when I decided that it would be OK to try and share myself again. 2 weeks ago, I went on my first date in 3 years. And it was fun!! I didn't stress out over whether or not he'd call, because I already knew that I was OK on my own if he didn't. I WANTED to see him, but I didn't NEED him. What a cool concept.Now, I'm not saying that you need to be chaste for 3 years. But, in my experience, learning to be comfortable in your own skin is SO FREEING. Understanding yourself makes you easier for other people to understand you. Developing your own taste makes you more intersting. Sorry for the wall of text... Again, I'm really tired and super reflective right now... But... That's my two cents :) You need to settle into a good relationship with yourself before you let anyone else in.

maxie760 [info] Can Molly or ecstasy trigger bipolar disorder? TL;DR: Took molly and triggered 2 mania episodes. Do I really have bipolar disorder?So I tried molly for the first time about a year ago and it was amazing I’ll admit. However, it caused me to go into a manic episode which ended up putting me in the psych hospital for 3 days. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given mood stabilizers to help with the symptoms and prevent another manic episode. However, my smart ass didn’t believe the doctor and thought it was a one time thing. Fast forward a month later and I had another manic episode which put me in the psych hospital again but only for a day. Does anyone else know of people who had a similar experience? Someone who never exhibited any symptoms of bipolar disorder until they tried a drug like ecstasy or molly?I’m very curious because I have been on a small dose of lamictal (mood stabilizer 100mg) for over a year now and have not had a depressive or manic episode since I began taking it. My new psychiatrist thinks it’s odd because people usually need way higher doses of mood stabilizers to feel normal and prevent manic and depressive episodes. [info] None [info] 1537859251
struggles3cuddles [info] Bipolar 1 Here’s the deal. Bipolar 1 rapid cycling has destroyed my life. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 rapid cycling, but when I switch to Stanford they diagnosed me with 2 rapid cycling. They did it because I had never been hospitalized. The only reason I have not been hospitalized is because my dad refused to. He had people beg him to hospitalize me, but instead he took me under his wing and hospitalized me under his care in a way. He thought it not conducive to my healing and in the end he took care of me.(he’s trained and it ruined my family) THE PART THAT IRKES ME Is that because of this they won’t diagnose me as 1. I struggled and my whole life was destroyed and this was more than hypo. I feel super invalidated and pissed off. Once again, people don’t believe you unless you’ve been checked in.  Sorry I’m just really irked. [info] BP1 Rapid Cycling [info] 1578351898
A_Grimm_Life [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar only after taking a bunch of antidepressants which likewise made the bipolar symptoms worse. I am on a blend of medications right now, and lithium was added to it just about 6 weeks ago. So far so good, but only time will tell. Abilify works great for some people, but it wasn't for me. It made my mouth numb making my words unintelligible, and I gained 40 lbs. (I've since lost most of it but I still have stretch marks.) So lithium works great for some but you won't know how it will affect  you until you're on it.There is a stigma with all mental illness. I haven't told many people that I have bipolar disorder for that reason. But think of it like this. Some people are diagnosed with cancer. They can't do anything about that, that's just their cross to carry. (Just an expression. Not trying to get religion involved) we have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It wasn't a choice on our part, we just have to do our best to deal with it. Anybody that truly loves us will be willing to support us through this.Stigma is out there, sure. People will makes jokes about bipolar just like people will still call things retarded even though that's an actual condition people have. I think it's improving and you shouldn't be hesitant to tell anybody about it. If they are to immature to accept it for what it is, then that'll tell you a lot about them as a person. Best wishes to you! [info] None [info] 1463068512

sayhitothehobo [info] I am 25 years old.  For 4 years I was diagnosed with bipolar.  I suggested other things like ADHD, but to no avail.  The problem is both bipolar and ADHD have a lot of overlapping symptoms.  The bigger problem is if you are bipolar and you take stims, you can cause or worsen mania episodes and make medications less effective in the future.  Unless the doctor is treating you poorly or inadequately, I would say wait it out for a bit.  Good psychs are really really hard to find.  But mediocre psychs will stop listening to you if you "become a troublemaker".  The docs I met were all qualified, but honestly most docs just don't give a shit if they think they are right.  I admit they knew more than me, and so I tried their way first.  Eventually I noticed that the drugs they gave me either did absolutely nothing or made me feel worse.  After that initial try it becomes YOUR choice.  Try more mood stabilizers/anti-depressants or try something completely different.  Sadly, trying something different almost always requires a new doctor.  Remember, after everything is said and done the doctor is working for you, not you for him/her.  If you don't like what they are saying, get a new doctor.  After 5 doctors I finally found a doctor who did not just agree with me, he actively tested me and talked with relatives and friends before he actually diagnosed me with ADHD (2 months later).  No other doctor ever tried to talk with my family or tried testing me.  It's sad, but my record said I was resistant to doctors and that I was manipulative.  Once people see that it becomes hard for anyone to listen.So I guess in summary try to be a little open with other diagnoses.  If you think you doctor is qualified, listen to and follow his advice.  If you think something is wrong, tell him.  If he disagrees it becomes your choice to stay on his path or change docs.  It is best not to fight with him.  Lastly, try to find a doc that has the time to see you and who actively tries to empathize and understand your situation.  These docs are very rare and if you find one, I would seriously consider staying with them instead of leaving.PS:  Mental health diagnoses are very commonly misdiagnosed.  If doctors make that mistake then I would imagine it would be easy for us to make it too.  It could be that you are neither bipolar nor ADHD.  You could be both.  You could have no illness at all or you might have a more serious one that you haven't even suspected yet.  It is very tough and sometimes speculative.  Some, like ADHD, are commonly comorbid with other mental illnesses.  And basically all of them have a lot of related symptoms.  It's tough and research is very important.  If you wanted to pick up some beginner books about ADHD you should try "Driven to Distraction" by Hallowell or "Taking charge of adult ADHD" by Barkley.  They both say pretty much the same thing though I liked the one by Barkley more.  Some people don't like Barkley because of where he gets his research money from.  He seemed legit to me and probably has researched Adult ADHD more than another other person alive.   [info] None [info] 1405305307
Truthful_lie [info] Feeling trapped Hello fellow Redditors,Long story short, I had a psychotic episode in 2014, went to the psych ward, but did not follow up after I was discharged because I thought it was just a nervous breakdown.  8 months later I ended up in the psych ward again and this time I was diagnosed with bipolar 1.Since the relapse I have been feeling hopeless and that life is not worth living.  On top of that, I am underemployed and hate my current job and I have no clue as to what other jobs I can do.  The world seems so fast paced that I can't keep up with it.  If I had passion for something, it would solve the problem I currently have : seeing life as a pointless endeavor and having to slave away at a job until I retire and die. I have been seeing a therapist and it isn't helping.  I don't know what else to do to get out of the hole I am in. [info] None [info] 1467290334

theawesomepart [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by several different doctors over the years, but my issues ended up being significantly more complex (not that bipolar disorder isn't complex as it stands). My diagnoses and meds ebbed and flowed as I aged, quit jobs and moved to different states on a whim, racked up debt, destroyed friendships, went in and out of therapy (group and individual), broke bones and wrecked cars, checked myself into detox for alcohol addiction, and did my time in out-patient rehab. I am now stabilized in recovery sans meds. I'm still self-obsessed and prone to addiction, but am also more self-aware, much more considerate, and less impulsive. Ultimately therapy and honesty (rather than a tidy diagnosis) have pulled the real issues out of me and have taught me to manage my chemistry better than medications ever did. I'm not saying medication isn't necessary/beneficial for some people, but pills don't truly help everyone. They made me dopey and certainly didn't motivate me to identify my issues or learn to cope/thrive with them. I AM thriving now btw--life is good.It's shocking how quickly doctors were willing to hand out shot-gun diagnoses and medication to me. I wager you'll find someone willing to issue you a bi-polar diagnosis and medication right quick but that may not help you stop the destructive behaviors. Rather than asking for a diagnosis I think it's healthier to take your time examining your symptoms--i.e. these behaviors--and talk them through extensively with a good therapist. Be extremely honest--denial and shame are the enemies of a true diagnosis and effective treatment. I needed doctors interested and clever enough to distrust me to get to this point (3.5 years sober and counting). Keep searching until you find creative medical practitioners who aren't in a rush to gather a co-pay and with whom you can really be honest. It was a difficult road to stability for me and a bunch of fast diagnoses got in the way from time to time. Best of luck. Be gentle and patient with yourself.**tl;dr I'm a patient, not a doctor so I'm speaking from my experience only: Find a doctor/therapist who listens and digs. Fast diagnosis may delay actual healing. Pursue alternatives to quicky prescription interventions.** [info] None [info] 1338351219
EasyPineapples [info] Just confused and scared I don’t know if this is the right sub, I lurk a lot here and it’s great to have a community that shares the same problems as me. I’m going through a manic period right now, and I think I just experienced my very first visual hallucination? I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago and am currently taking medication. Tonight after gym, it was raining super hard and I was looking out my window pretty intensely, not sure why, no reason I guess. But I swear I saw a man, walking down the street, and he was huge and was carrying some sort of weapon, like a sharp bat? My neighborhood is private and I rarely see people outside ever. It looked like he was coming right toward my house so I freaked the fuck out. I looked away, looked back, he’s gone. I look back, he’s there again. Look away, look back, he’s gone, and he’s been gone since. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. That was my very first time seeing anything, I do experience slight auditory hallucinations but I’ve NEVER seen anything. I know logically it wasn’t real, but what the fuck? I’m super terrified and I don’t wanna leave my house. I guess I’m in need of support. :( [info] None [info] 1550132296

BornOn8thOfJuly [info] We're not nice. We're mean. &gt;:)I have very limited experience, so I am hoping someone else who knows more will post. I can only tell you my experience. I immigrated to the United States to do a Ph.D. I was diagnosed with bipolar II back home. I have the insurance plan that employees of the university has (as a ph.d student you are paid a living wage and teach, and it came with insurance). They did not ask for any pre-existing conditions when I enrolled. And so, I had a pre-existing condition and was not denied insurance. I can't say if that is the norm with employee health insurance plans. This was just my experience. Granted, this was also with Kaiser Permanente who are, from what I understand, probably one of the most compassionate insurance providers. [info] None [info] 1496065063
TheTimeTombs [info] 4gs with Bipolar Disorder Hello r/shrooms, just wanted to share a story of mine that I feel might save those with similar conditions some sanity.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18, but my episodes are few and far between now. This will be important later.Dose: 4gs Me and three others decided to trip at their house.I was overwhelmed with joy to say the least. I remember laying back on the couch as we had a montage of blissful landscapes displaying on the tv screen, and calming music to accompany it. I closed my eyes with my head back and the visuals began flooding in. I was looking up into a vaulted ceiling with a carved mosaic spiral leading to the top. Within each of these ‘pieces of the mosaic’ I saw a different me. Every variable of my life shown to me, whether it be friends, religion, career, etc. In all of them I was happy, and I swear to you when I say this, but I felt such an immense love within me that I hadn’t any doubt that I’d be happy for the rest of my existence. No matter what I’d be doing, I’d be content from here on out. Then like the switch of a light I was shown a very dark side of my mind. I was shown all the horrible, morbid, monstrous acts I could chose to do. All the pieces of the mosaic disappeared and the horrid images of myself executing these acts were flashing before me at a rapid pace. All the while I was smiling, and I couldn’t understand why. I knew that these things were unspeakable, but for some reason I was smiling. Why was I smiling? Why shouldn’t I smile? Well Aren’t these things the very acts humanity has so despised that he created the death penalty for? Where has my moral compass gone? What is morality? Where does my personal morality lay? I couldn’t come up with an answer, and I felt sickly. I got up from the chair to keep my mind off these disgusting images, but they followed me. I was opening cabinets and staring at the floor hoping to god it would pass and I could regain control of my sanity again, but I felt like I had forever destroyed any sense of right and wrong from my being. I eventually lay down and urged myself to sleep so that I could wake from this maniacal nightmare. I woke up the next day with control again, but I was utterly shaken and ashamed I had ever thought of such unspeakable things. To this day I believe what I encountered was what Carl Jung refers to as the ‘shadow’. A slumbering beast that sits within all of us in the darkest recesses of our repressed minds. I have not tripped since. Thanks for reading. [info] None [info] 1567363630
antisocialmedic [info] I had mental problems from pretty early. Started self harming in, like, first grade. Lots of anger issues, too. At 14 I got diagnosed with PTSD but I got that treated, so I thought it was all over, even though the self loathing and anger and self harm continued. Didn't realize until I got fired from a job at the age of 23 (for mental instability following the birth of my child) and had a mental breakdown and hospitalized (for the fifth time in my life) that I actually had something more going on than that. For me, PTSD was an easier diagnosis to stomach because it was the fault of some external source. And while it was awful, it was *their* fault and not something inherently flawed with me. Later I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD and PTSD became BPD (and then went back to C-PTSD after a year of treatment) and suddenly it seemed that I was just a really flawed, fucked up person. Suddenly I had people telling me I should have aborted my babies because I was so fucked up and defective. Not sure where I'm going with this. I've been drinking so perhaps nowhere good. In any case, each diagnosis came from real doctors. So I'm not just picking them out of a hat. If I was picking my own mental status, I would go with perfectly healthy and sound of mind- which I really am these days, usually. But that's with a lot of work and medication. It's like if I went around telling everyone I have some kind of horrible chronic illness for funsies and cool points. Like "Hey, I have  chrons disease, isn't that *cool*!?"

Saratoninn5 [info] Battling with justification of my thoughts Fair warning: this is lengthy and borderline ranty. I'm 27 years old and I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder type two. My childhood was rough, with multiple traumas involved. I grew up too fast and even more bitter. My closet friends and good standing family members always knew where my anger stemmed from. No one ever assumed I was mentally ill from the beginning. It wasn't until recently that I realized my reactions are heavily weighing the situations that sparked them.A few weeks ago, I lost my job as a General Manager (which was big for me) because I couldn't control my emotions during a customer service spat. I ended up calling the customer a bitch after she took a photo of me. The angry woman ended up posting it online, and claimed that I assaulted her. I'd be the first to tell you if I did because I sure as hell wanted to but even at my angriest- I don't and never have hit a person. So, this woman somehow got the post to go "viral" in the small town we are in, with up to 700 shares on FB. Even going as far as saying I shouldn't work with children, when no children were involved. The company felt obligated to terminate me even though the security cameras proved my innocence. But either way I was an instant liability for the company and they rightfully terminated me. After I was let go, I didn't sleep for over 72 hours. I've been spiraling ever since too. My thoughts are filled with revenge plots, surrounding moments, and pure hate. The woman who attacked me online happened to be black and I'm struggling with thoughts of racism for the first time now. I didn't even know my mind was capable of being so ugly. The worst part is that the anger isn't going down with time. This woman cost me my livelihood over a petty customer service issue. I'm struggling to pay my bills, may get denied unemployment, and I'm incapable of job hunting with my current mental state.We grow up with these rich stories of revenge on the TV screen but if you act on these feelings in real life- you're labeled a monster. What I'm having a hard time with is how right these thoughts feel.. Like, with the racism thoughts I can stop and acknowledge that my brain is going off the deep end. I actively try to avoid judging an entire race- thank God. But I'm straight up giddy at the thought of destroying this woman's life at the seams. I'm just unsure of how abnormal these thought processes are? How do people without bipolar disorder handle situations like this? I'm scared of where my brain will go next. So, instead of allowing myself to act on anything; I'm taking advantage of my unemployment. Tomorrow, I'm going to the local health department and starting the process to getting on meds for the first time. Thankfully, there's income based care options in my state. Living with this much anger is exhausting, even more so when you think it's justified. I just want to forget about all of it and move on with my life. [info] None [info] 1512023101
downinfragglerockk [info] Wrong Diagnosis? So a couple years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar. Things were really bad for me back then, and the medication helped when I consistently took it.I’m 19 now, and I guess my hormones have regulated or something, because I am much better off than I used to be. However, sometimes I still have really really bad days where I’m so depressed that I can’t do anything. I don’t really experience any mania or hypomania anymore. Does that mean I’m no longer bipolar? Can that even happen? Or am I just in a long depressive episode, and mania will return?I’d love to hear your thoughts! [info] None [info] 1571798517

tblitzy [info] My parents took me to a therapist when I was 12. After a few sessions the therapist directed me to a psychiatrist that worked in the same clinic. She sent him an introductory email about me and during the appointment I was asked a few questions. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed medications (I think they were mood stabilizers).Then a few months later my mom took me to another psychiatrist as my old one left the country. The new one, after being told about my previous diagnosis was kind of shocked and said that it was very unlikely I was bipolar at this age. I told her about the symptoms I was experiencing and she concluded it was ADHD. I had to withdraw from my medication and start adderall which made me lose a lot of weight.Fast forward a year later, I move countries and go to this new doctor. My mom asks if my medication can be changed because my current ones weren’t doing much good. I’m asked a lot of questions until she concludes I need to be taken off Adderall, because apparently I’m not ADHD, it’s major depressive disorder. So I withdraw, again, and boom, antidepressants.I’m 14, been on them for a few months now and they’re actually working. My parents still have no idea what’s really going on with me.

moonste3 [info] Have I been oblivious? Hey guys so I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 7 months ago and had a manic episode that led me to be sent to the mental ward. But ever since my hospitalization I have been fine and haven't had a manic episode. This has led me to start believing that I am getting better from my bipolar and will one day not have it. I also tell myself that I won't have another manic episode. I did some research and it said that the recurrence of another episode is over 60%. Can anyone chime in and tell me that if it's likely or not that I will have another episode in my lifetime? [info] None [info] 1548133790
Glibat [info] First of all, I wouldn't make excuses for your GPA in an interview. Own it. I didn't graduate with the best GPA (3.2 overall), and that's largely due to screwups my first two years when I was figuring out what I wanted. When I was doing interviews in college, I handed them my transcript and immediately explained what bad grades they would see, and how I have grown from that. I also was careful to point out my progress through the years (graduated with straight A's for my last 4 semesters). Have your grades increased over time? Can you show that you've gotten better? Learned more?A lot of places I looked at had GPA requirements straight out of college, but the place I ended up working at waived their requirement for me (3.5) because I had an internship for 1.5 years using C#, and they could see I got good grades in the classes that mattered. What were your internships like? What did you use while there? What did you learn? Focus on these strengths.Finally, and this is just my opinion, I would focus on getting some certifications. That's something that you can own and will show your ability to complete something well. Overall, though, I would not walk into an interview talking about bipolar disorder and a car accident. That's not really something they want to hear. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago, and have never mentioned it to an employer simply because I don't ever want them to treat me differently.

g1i [info] &gt; do any other of you INTJs have a burning desire to hurt or even kill someone?There are many ways to hurt someone, why fixate on physical violence? And it seems like you don't have a specific reason for wanting to hurt *someone*. Rather, the way you've phrased it, you just want to hurt *anyone*. Is there a specific person you want to hurt, or is it just a random urge? &gt;  Some background information. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder of the sub-type mixed. However, I've been doing well off medication for quite some time now; at times I doubt that this diagnosis. If you want to go around murderin' people, I'm gonna have to disagree with your assessment. That said, you may well be correct that the medication you're on isn't working for you, or that your diagnosis may not be complete or correct. Ongoing therapy is really critical for managing this stuff. Unfortunately, mental health and medication is never cut and dry. You can't just take some pills and the problems go away.&gt; My issue is that, depending on what I have been doing, one of my parents likes to tell me that I should not be taking certain actions or doing certain things. They like to say "you are gonna end up in the hospital again." Also they keep trying to tell me what I should be doing with regards to diet and whatnot else. So they're turning your hospitalization into a threat to keep you in check. Yeah, I'd want to punch / maim someone who did that, too. Don't let *their* bullshit cloud the issue of your mental health. There may well be something going on with you, but the fact that they are trivializing it with their behavior doesn't make it trivial. Make sense?&gt; This frustrates me beyond any logical reason. That's not true. There are many logical reasons to find that frustrating.&gt; I have a similar reaction to other people who try to force their logic on me. It frustrates me beyond reason and makes me want to break things or hurt the offender. For obvious reasons, particularly the consequences I would face from hurting someone, I have never carried these thoughts out. If I may. You're a teenager / young adult living at home with parents who not only fail to "get you" in the traditional sense, but are also patronizing you and worse, threatening you with treatment for a mental illness you may or may not have. Treatment should never be a threat. It's *treatment*. Your reactions and feelings to being out of control of your own life, and not being given the resources to step up to independence and self-control is incredibly frustrating and demoralizing. Your instincts to hurt people are likely a result of this feeling of powerlessness, but you also recognize that they aren't appropriate and you don't want to act on them.&gt; I am worried that I may one day be pushed to far and do something that I will regret, although I will not feel any remorse, and suffer consequences as a result. I was just wondering if anyone else has these thoughts that pass through their heads on a fairly regular basis.In your situation, I probably would. What I'd advise you to do instead is talk to your parents about starting talk therapy with someone you like and trust. That's the first step in ANY mental health issue, but for you I think it will be more relevant for dealing with your parents and talking through the challenges you're facing. Your worries are legitimate and speak well of you. Instead of feeling marginalized by a diagnosis, take control over your treatment and be proactive. Whether or not you are bi-polar is almost irrelevant here - talking to a professional will only help you, no matter what's going on. [info] INTJ [info] 1399306806
Satellites- [info] With my experience, there was a whole host of other issues going on with the friendship, including her being fairly abusive towards me, making racist remarks about one of our mutual friend's partners, calling me fat and simultaneously telling other people about my issues (I have been diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder) etc etc. The friendship wasn't salvageable, I knew it, I had tried to talk to her numerous times about our dynamic and how her behaviour was affecting me, whilst giving her the chance to talk about any issues she had. Her exact response was "I've never had a friend be so honest with me... and I don't like it", she would shut down or tell me it would change and then it wouldn't change.At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide if you want or don't want the friendship anymore. I was downvoted for relating my experience, likely because I chose to give up the friendship when so many here seem to think that because a friendship is long, you should work for it. I believe that it's not about the length of the friendship but the quality. If you are not getting any happiness from continuing this friendship, then why would you? You don't owe this girl anything, despite what people might say, and if she is so blind that she can't see that her actions might be hurtful or dismissive, then why would you want to continue the friendship anyway? There's nothing wrong with ending a friendship you don't think is working for you, no matter how long it lasted. As I get older, I realise more and more that I am not interested in working extremely hard to keep a friendship going against all odds, and that if I have to have the same conversations with my friends about boundaries and the way they talk about and to me, then it's not worth having them around. I wish that my friendship with my friend hadn't ended the way it did because I loved her. But she changed, a lot, and we just weren't compatible anymore. For months, I suffered, worrying about what I should do and how I should approach it whilst she continued to say awful things about me behind my back. I miss the way she was, but she hasn't got any better and I made the right decision for my own peace of mind. [info] None [info] 1388456006
RollerDoll [info] I too am bipolar II and am on lamictal as a monotherapy.  I'm thinking about adding an antidepressant to the mix because the lamictal makes the episodes less frequent, but about every other month I dive for three or four days and am absolutely convinced that the only way to cure the pain is to kill myself.  That's followed by three or four days where I practice piano and guitar for hours and hours a day.  Urgh.But I digress.  I'm glad you've decided to go back on the prozac.  Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was taking celexa and was having sexual side effects, so I quit taking it one day.  A couple of weeks later, I was in a psych ward.  Taking your meds is serious shit - if you're having unwanted side effects from the prozac, definitely definitely try something else - but you gotta wean yourself off slowly while the other drug takes effect.Good luck.

shamy52 [info] I've done reasonably well on Lexapro for years so I think I'm OK there.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 less than two weeks ago (although I'd had my suspicions for several months) and so far I'm loving Seroquel.  :D  I feel like I spent 20 years begging doctors to give me a pill to make me sleep (I took Ambien as a young woman and hallucinated but it worked, I fell asleep and woke up rested!)  Finally, Negrete the PA gave me Seroquel and I've slept like a baby since.  I'm hoping I can stay on these two long term.  :)I don't remember why I was so sad the day of the Magic MRI but it was probably situational, having to do with the clusterfuck that is living with MS.  I know it was after my divorce so probably I was sad about *that* heartbreak or maybe I was sad because of the rebound relationship I had after that or maybe it was a family situation... it's great that I can't remember what it was because that means the situation resolved.  :P [info] None [info] 1572552354
mercyphoenix [info] When I was around 8 or so, I always felt these random urges to cry. Nothing had to happen for the urge to come up. I remember bawling my eyes out one time at dinner for no reason, and my parents seemed super frustrated that I wasn’t able to tell them why. I believed they were my ‘baby instincts;’ my line of logic behind this was that sometimes babies just cry randomly, even when they’re not hungry or tired or in need of a diaper change, and since I was still young, maybe I didn’t grow out of them yet. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 14. [info] None [info] 1559017225
wehadarocket [info] I’m not in the psychiatric field, but I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t throw out a diagnosis if they weren’t positive they had that condition. Mislabeling someone can have a really negative effect, almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy. “I was diagnosed with bipolar so that’s why I’m acting this way!” So yeah, I’m pretty sure “the girl” didn’t throw out disorders at her, and if she did I’m pretty sure that’s frowned upon.

Smokesalottapottamus [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder many years ago, long before I awoke to what my nmom &amp; nbro are.  Several times over the years, my medication was working so well that I managed to convince myself that I was now (then) cured and I didn't need my meds any more.  I'd go off them for while until it became clear once again that I'm still mentally ill and require medication.  Maybe No Contact is like that.  The longer my family ignores the narcs, the stronger and better I feel, making me feel like I might even be able to handle a conversation with them.  But my experience with the bipolar meds lets me know that the only reason I feel so much better is that No Contact is working and I shouldn't ruin a good thing just because nmom conditioned me from birth to always love her and feel guilty for not loving her even more.  If No Contact is working for you, keep it up :) [info] None [info] 1510994090

reevision [info] New to Adderall...not feeling anything I was recently diagnosed with ADHD after finally seeing a therapist and getting a comprehensive psych eval. Backing up: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD in 2007. Been taking Lamictal and Wellbutrin all these years and I’ve mostly been okay—no suicidal ideation and virtually no mania. But something was still so off. I haven’t drank in 1.5 years either. I was both surprised and not when I got the ADHD dx. Greeeaaaat. One more thing to add to the list. I was actually kind of incredulous, too. Nonetheless, I made an appointment with my pdoc thinking he’d tell me the dx was incorrect but lo and behold, he said “yup, let’s start treatment with meds.” I felt relieved. Why did I feel so defensive about it? It’s probably the drug aspect. He prescribed Adderall 10mg twice a day on week days and once on Saturday. It was spring break for me so I’ve only been taking it in the AM, but today was my first day back to work and I took one pill at 7am and one at 12pm. I feel nothing. And I’ve felt nothing since I’ve been taking just one pill a day since last Wednesday. When will this kick in? I’m used to the slow-to-start meds, but this isn’t one so I’m just confused. I’m sure this is as easy as “it takes time” and “talk to your doctor” but I just need people with experience to reassure me. Thank you. :) [info] None [info] 1553546870

CuttlestheCuttlefish [info] Anyone else had friends be non-supportive of BPD diagnosis? So I likely have BPD, according to my psychiatrist. He wants to look into me starting DBT. So I mentioned my likely diagnosis to a friend I know who has BPD herself, and she was perfectly supportive, and encouraging. She was glad I’m trying to get help. The others I told, who don’t have BPD? Not so much. Comments ranged from outright, “You can’t POSSIBLY have that” to “I know plenty of normal people like that, you’re fine” to criticizing DBT individual and group therapy, as being “absolutely ridiculous”.  Many called it an “unnecessary label”. One person even thought I meant bipolar disorder, and said I didn’t seem bipolar, which is absolutely hilarious, because I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 12 years old, and continue to take medication for it. I thought it was very strange that they weren’t aware of this! All in all, it felt like most people were the exact opposite of supportive. In fact, many were downright discouraging! Here, I’m trying to get better, and being told not to take steps to get better at all. I know I’m definitely not okay, and I didn’t think I hid my emotions so well...or maybe these friends are just seeing what they want to see?Has anyone else had friends react this way when coming out as BPD or even (such as in my case) likely BPD?

MAMA_OLIF [info] Not a man but when I was 14 years old in high school, 2012. I was different and I got a lot of shit for it but that’s not the focus of this story. To set the scene I was in woodshop class and I was the safety monitor. I was standing up supervising what people were doing as the teacher was talking (some people did dumb dangerous shit because, you know, 14 year olds). This one kid had put multiple things in the vice grip on his desk. So I glared at him. He apparently thought my annoyance was funny so he just kept doing it and he started stabbing scissors into the wood with a shit eating grin on his face. I said something along the lines of you better cut it out. He just kept smiling at me and kept acting like an idiot. I was livid and I walked over to him and I backhanded that disrespectful shit on the back of his head. It was dead silent in the classroom and once I realized what I had done I was horrified, until I looked up at the teacher and I saw that he was smiling. The kid I hit looked shocked and yelled, “DID YOU JUST SEE THAT????” My teacher just smiled wider and said “yeah” and he continued to teach the class. The kid was dead silent and behaved himself for the rest of the period. 4-5 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder lol [info] None [info] 1562975830

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD in February and it’s been really rough trying to get through this. I really want to be with someone that will support me, like me for who I am, and push me to be the best version of me. I want to start with just chatting and see where things go.

guuurl [info] When I was in high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they prescribed me lamictal. I was only on it for two months but those were the worst two months of my life. But at the end of those two months I also felt like I had more clarity on my situation in life than I have ever had. I was in a verbally abusive relationship that had just become physically abusive. I didn't tell my parents what happened, but I was crying (literally) for help. It was after a bout of screaming in the middle of the night and me repeatedly saying "I don't want to live anymore", that they decided I needed to see a doctor (the almost had me committed right then, instead they locked up all the knives and pills). The pain I felt was real and felt physical. The analogy of treading water most accurately describes it, because I literally felt like I was drowning. I would never actually kill myself, but I used to wish something would happen, like I'd get hit by a semi while driving, and it would all just end. At the end of my rounds with lamictal, I realized that I needed to end things with my abusive boyfriend, cut ties, and do things for me instead. That was 4 years ago and I can honestly say even when things are bad, they aren't nearly as bad as they were.  [info] None [info] 1325220830

I've been way less obviously hypomanic than say, someone with bipolar 1 with full blown mania. But I am irritable, and can say things I regret in the heat of the moment. I can become hypomanic when I'm head over heels "in love" with someone, or passionately obsessed with something.I can see reasonable doubt for the diagnosis, but I've been in therapy for almost my whole life off and on, and I was diagnosed with bipolar at 25 years.It can happen.

AriaoftheStars17 [info] A long story about me not being good enough. Sorry for the length, I just need to be heard. We had a really good relationship for 4 years. I, a girl emotionally abused by a mother who had taught me that I was unpretty, unlikable and weird, sat down in a 9th grade geography class. Behind me were two boys. I was always very talkative - and annoying - and i was used to being brushed off or dismissed. But one of those two boys paid attention to me. When I talked, he would look straight at me, and listen. His name was Ryan.I liked Ryan a lot, but I knew he was out of my league. I'm annoying, I'm not remotely as pretty as other girls, my personality is abhorrent, and there was definitely something... wrong about me. But I wanted to be around him. So I'd bother him all the time. He sat behind me in grade 9 English class and I would always be turned around in my seat asking the most obnoxious questions. After all, the more ridiculous the questions, the more likely I was to get his attention, whether positive or negative. My "friend" at the time used to tell me off constantly. "Stop harrassing him, he doesn't want to talk to you. You're making yourself look like an idiot." (She ghosted me a few months later for cooler friends; I found out years later that she had a crush on Ryan and had actually hit on him while we were dating.) But sometimes my weird questions made him laugh. Mr. Quiet Guy would smile and it made me feel so amazing.The next year, we had English together again. I sat in front of him. I was still obnoxious and unattractive and horrible, but he had become kind of used to me by then. We were even friends.I went to even greater measures to get his attention. I acknowledge it was creepy as hell, but 15-year-old me thought it was a great idea to stalk him. I found out his birthday, and when i told him, he questioned me to figure out how I knew. "I have my ways..." (Facebook, duh.) I liked the attention. So I escalated. I found out his phone number, and he was even more freaked out (but not repulsed, for some reason), and grilled me a bit. I took it as a challenge, and found out where he lived. It became some kind of joke. A really weird joke that would probably put me in jail today, but, uh, yeah. Somehow, I think he was flattered by my interest or something. No girl had ever gone to the lengths that I had. No one had ever shown the interest that I did.He told me the first time he ever pictured me in a romantic way was in that grade 10 English class. We had to watch a really horrible modern version of Romeo&amp;Juliet (the Di Caprio version, ugh), and at one point I got bored with the movie and decided to take a nap. I turned around in my seat, grabbed his arm, and used it as my pillow. And as I napped, I guess he began to think about me.October of grade 11, I invited him to a Halloween party at my house. There was definitely something going on. We talked about movies, and I suggested that he come over to watch my favourite movie, and he said okay. That day, when he came over to watch Se7en with me, he held my hand. I was over the moon. A few weeks later, we went to his house to watch his favourite movie, and that's where I had my first kiss.It's been a rocky journey. I, insecure and broken, dumped him more than once because I was terrified of commitment and convinced that he was lying about wanting to be with me. It never lasted longer than a year, and then we'd be together again. For the first time, someone wanted to be around me. Someone cared about what I had to say, someone cared enough to get to know all of me, someone cared enough to stop me from suiciding because he didn't want to see me go. For the first time, someone wanted me.He gave me the confidence to believe in myself. I started to feel pretty. He inspired me to work hard in school as my rival, he motivated me to be something more than what my mother moulded me to be. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe I was actually worth something.On October 10th, 2019, I started to experience bad side effects from a med my doc had put me on. You know how psych medications usually have a side effect of suicide? Yeah. It was a really scary day. I called Ryan, as I did whenever I had any kind of crisis (which was fairly often). Usually he was really calm and supportive; that day, he seemed distant, annoyed even. I asked him what was going on. "Do you realize you have a new crisis every week?" Um, I guess. "It's pretty stressful." I'm aware, I'm the one having them. He told me he was tired, he's been tired for months. I asked him if he wanted to break up with me. He hesitated for a long time. Too long. I said, "I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want me." "Yeah, I think we should go on a break." "Oh. Okay." And I, in the midst of a suicidal crisis, hung up the call.I went into shock and became numb. That's probably lucky, because considering the purpose of the call in the first place, things could have gotten really bad. Instead I tried to study for an exam scheduled for the next morning, 8am. I didn't focus very much.On Friday, I wanted to talk to him about what happened. He complained that he had an exam that night and didn't want to deal with stress before then. I understood and told him we would talk Saturday.Saturday came, I tried to call him. He told me he couldn't: He was "sick" and lost his voice. Oh. Fine, we'll talk by text. I asked him about the terms and conditions of our "break". How long? Would we still talk to each other, or stay away?"Yeah... I said break, but I really meant break up."After 4 years, he broke up with me by text.It came so out of the blue. All the time I would ask him if there was something in the relationship that we could change, if there was anything that bothered him, and he always said he was happy. We had plans to celebrate Thanksgiving that weekend. A few days before, he told me he loved me, and I thought I could believe it.I got really upset. I was still feeling the affects of that evil medication (fuck Abilify), and I began to feel suicidal again. I asked him why, he kept insisting he "wants to be alone" and "needs space". I asked him if there was another girl, he said no. The only thing he would tell me was that I was too "needy", too dependent. My bad for thinking he was someone I could depend on.I asked him if he'd be saying this if I wasn't broken. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year, and I've always dealt with highs and lows (especially lows). It's not easy for anyone, especially for me. So I asked, and he refused to answer. He kept saying it was an unfair question. He wouldn't say "no".By Wednesday of the next week, I decided I could not keep myself safe. I went to the hospital and was admitted to the psyc ward... sort of. They didn't have enough beds. I was 8th on the waiting list. I sat and waited for 20 hours with nothing to do. No phones, no books, nothing but the company of the others waiting. We slept in waiting room chairs. It was really bad. They taught me what to say to get out of there, so when I was reassessed in the morning, I told them I was fine. I feel better now. So they let me go.I wasn't fine. I was still depressed and suicidal, and I couldn't help but text him in anger and hurt and ask for his help, because I really wanted to die.On Monday, after a night talking me out of killing myself, he blocked me. On everything. When I found out that night, I was angry. I called him over and over from another phone. He didn't answer. The next day, I waited outside of his class to try and confront him, but he wasn't there.My dad and I went to his house. My dad went in to talk, and said he would text me when they gave me permission to come in. Sitting in the car was making me anxious, so I went outside so I could see the doorway. I stood in the pouring rain for at least 30 minutes. I was never allowed in. Apparently my dad never saw Ryan, but talked to his parents, who said that he has been stressed lately and that I needed to stop manipulating (?) him with threats of suicide. "He needs space," they said.Wednesday of that week was my first suicide attempt. Well, sort of. I gathered my supplies, got ready to go, but chickened out.October 29th, I was walking in my uni near the gyms, and I heard cling-clang sounds. It sounded like swords... and Ryan is on the fencing team. Sure enough, I peeked in, and there they were. I scanned the room, didn't see him, and was going to leave... but one of the people fencing caught my eye. No way, I thought, but he took off his mask and... it was him. I hadn't seen his face in about a month, and he was so fucking beautiful. He looked up at me, looked away, and did a double-take. So I waved. He kind of grimaced but didn't come over, so I sat down on a bench outside the gym and decided to wait. I would wait until his practice was finished, and I would finally confront him.He kept giving me the side-eye, pretending that he wasn't looking at me. Eventually, he walked to the back of the gym, towards his coach. Uh-oh. He started talking to his coach, who looked right at me. Uh-oh. His coach started walking in my direction. UH-OH."Are you here to see Ryan?""Yes.""Ah. The thing is, you being here is making Ryan nervous, and it's affecting his practice. As a coach, I have to step in and ask you to leave."I asked him if he knew the situation. He did. It turns out that the coach is very nice. He wasn't a fan of the ghosting situation either, and tried to comfort me. He seemed to understand. He promised he would talk to Ryan about it after practice. I left feeling hopeful.After practice, I heard back from Ryan. Sort of. He texted my dad, and told him that he was opening a case file with campus security.I was devastated. I couldn't believe that after 4 years, he would go to such extreme lengths just to avoid talking to me. He threw me out like trash. Suddenly, I was in 9th grade again. I was ugly, dumb, annoying, unlikable, and undeserving of affection. The boy who had built me up was now breaking me down. He didn't even care.Two days later, October 31st, 2019, was my second suicide attempt, sort of. I packed my supplies and was really serious about it. I had a plan to make sure I wouldn't be found alive. I went to school that morning as a decoy; if my last known location was at school, they would probably spend a good amount of time searching the grounds there before they expanded their search elsewhere, and hopefully by then, I would be gone. With no self-worth, no support, my grades slipping through my fingers, I felt no reason to stick around. I was ready.But my teacher wanted to talk to me after class. She asked me if I was okay. I cracked.She wouldn't let me leave. She made me call my Oma, walked me down to the parking lot, and made sure I got into the car. I spent the rest of the day under full supervision, without telling anyone my true plans for the day. So I survived.It is November 10th. I am trying to get back up, but I am struggling. I am trying so hard: I have three therapists, I've gone to all my teachers to get help with my grades, I've shown up to every work shift even though I feel like shit, I have attended most of my classes and written most of my exams. I even started personal training, even though I hate exercise, to try and get healthier. I am trying so, so hard. But it doesn't change anything. I am that same girl from 9th grade. I am worthless and undeserving of love. I am bipolar and broken, and "too stressful", and I would be better off dead. But here I am. I'm alive, and I'm trying.It has been exactly one month. I spent most of my free time crying. My plan for suicide has become very detailed and elaborate, and if I'm able to go through with it, I will not be found. But so far, I am alive.I'm sorry this was so long. I needed to be heard. I need someone to know I exist, and that I'm hurting, and that I'm trying so hard. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1573368446
cakecrisis [info] It could be that you are going through an episode currently or that you’re entering one. I’ve been there and it’s extremely scary. I was hostile and even attacked my own mother after she locked herself in her bathroom and I broke down the door. I was hallucinating and having delusions and having memory problems, and time lapses. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and put on medication and my life is much better now. The thing you must remember is that you are still you, and you’re not alone. I’m not a doctor and I can’t give you medical advice but only advice from my personal experience. It’s a really terrifying thing and mental illness is really tricky. The most important thing is that you are safe, and your parents hopefully should see that. If you’re feeling like you can’t trust yourself or don’t feel safe around yourself or are slipping away from reality please please please, get help. I understand that money is a huge deal and a big issue for you and many people but you come first. It got so bad for me that I thought it the episode would last forever and if it did I’d have to kill myself. I’m so glad I reached out and got help. Remember, you come first, money has to come after. You are the priority and getting your mental health back in order is what’s most important.  [info] None [info] 1552246676

AbyssalCrime [info] IDK. My buddy has a felony for selling counterfeit cocaine(powdered sugar) when he was a teenager and has tried on multiple occasions to purchase a firearm and has been denied. The laws are in place, and they work, however bad guys don't get their guns legally. They get them by stealing them, or buying them off the Mexican cartels. By the standards of the proposed mental health ban for gun buying, I technically fall under the category of mental health patient. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age. It does nothing to me but make me cry when I get upset. Yet, this would keep me from legally obtaining a firearm. I'm prior law enforcement and a us veteran.

Juneau_Fire [info] Bipolar and BPD dual diagnosis (TW) Hi all awesome people. Just wanted to get some stuff out and see if if anyone else had similar situations. I was diagnosed with bipolar II around six years ago, went through Psychs and GPs etc and ended up taking Lithium for a few years. Within the last year I found that lithium was 'greying' me out. I had no creativity and no interest in the stuff that was supposed to be fun. I am quite musical and also have synaesthesia so I found lithium really affected my music writing ability. Recently however I have had some difficulties and been referred back to a pdoc. He has asked all the same questions and given an added diagnosis of 'emotionally unstable BPD with impulsive type'. I'm not disputing the impulsive type, but I am nowhere near an emotional person. In fact, I have been told I am cold sometimes and don't react correctly in some situations. I am in a relationship with the most awesome and understanding guy ever, and he thinks I am generally emotionally stable. It's really thrown me off to be given a new added diagnosis. I just wanted to know if anyone else has had this issue. Thanks in advance. [info] None [info] 1423003181

Cashley42069 [info] I wouldn't know, I don't have it. Though one of my hospital discharges says I do have bipolar 2, but it's from the hospitalization after I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 so the bipolar 1 is the diagnosis that sticks because I already had a full manic episode in the past. The same discharge paper has my "Global Measure of Disability (WHODAS)" classified as severe.It sure would be nice if I had all the relevant information on 1 discharge summary instead of having 4 and having to pick around for details.

GuardianBell [info] Thankyou for sharing your story and clarifying points!I am not on the spectrum, but I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 as well as GAD and panic disorder and ADHD in my childhood. I was also addicted to codeine and other opiates for over one year. It came to a point where I couldn't feel good if I wasn't doing drugs or thinking about doing drugs. I didn't know I was bipolar, and my mother did not allow me to be admitted into intensive day therapy, even though I was legally an adult. So I pushed. I quit the drugs cold-turkey and withdrew. With proper medications, I managed my bipolar. I am drug sober since August 2015 and alcohol sober since January 2017. I pushed and kept on pushing until I felt something again. It took me three years to learn how to feel again. To genuinely feel happiness and curiosity.What I didn't realize before was that I didn't need to love myself to do things to benefit me. Other people have always taken control...of the way I dressed or of the things I ate or the company I kept. The act of self-care is foreign to us, because we're so used to having others berate us and tell us the 'right' way to do things that we don't develop our own interests or allow ourselves to make mistakes. Whether beaten by words or by fists, the things we experienced in childhood stuck with us. So we search for what we were deprived of: a sense of self, identity, purpose. Love.Keep pushing until you can't. Get a skateboard or another hobby you might like, learn things about topics that you enjoy just because you enjoy them. Lastly, in regards to people...questions can often be seen as accusations. An observational statement can be interpreted as a slight against them or their morals, and it is difficult to navigate those types of conversations without the ability to interpret social cues. When people become defensive, it can be impossible to get close to them. Then of course, there are those occasional narcissists who we all want to avoid!Keep on pushing yourself forward. Ask for help if you are able to. Learn and re-learn. Exhaust all options before catching the bus. [info] None [info] 1508478683
boberito [info] Yes, it's hard to diagnose someone so young when it comes to mood disorders, and some doctors don't do it. However, it's completely plausible for him to be showing signs of it as an adolescent. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at the age of 20, but there was a history of "behavior issues" beginning around the age of 6 for me (though nothing like this post describes). How a mental illness presents can absolutely change over time, especially during puberty!! I think you should follow the advice of other Redditors here and set up a psych evaluation (even if it's inpatient). Tell the doctors everything, especially family history of mood disorders such as bipolar and substance abuse issues. They might not give a formal diagnosis due to age, but it will help them when determining treatment options going forward. Best of luck. You guys are great parents.  [info] None [info] 1547770427
sflfaa [info] I thought I was a pirate. The title says it all. Whenever I was in a manic state (this was before I was diagnosed with bipolar), I was doing all sorts of odd things. I thought the entire city of Erie was throwing me a party. I thought I bought a BMW, and I was walking around the streets, asking people if they’ve seen my keys (for the car that existed but was not mine). You guys already know being in a manic state affects your cognition, or decision making if you will. But I took a shower in a random mans house, in his basement. Met him by walking on a street and asked if I could use his hose to take a shower. He then offered me a hot shower, I accepted it. I took a shower, put on a pretty dress, and left. Looking back at it now, I could have been killed. But glad it was him, and not some creep that would have hurt me. I was up for days, cops were called on me many times. Thinking I was on drugs. But I was completely sober. I started walking in the middle of the night, and if any of you are familiar with the Erie, PA area, you’ll know that there is a pirate ship on the pier. I tried to board the ship, with intentions to steal it. The employees escorted me out of the ship. And then I fell asleep on the pier, with my feet hanging over the ledge. I was woken up by cops. And they detained me until my parents could come and pick me up. I don’t remember some of the events in Erie. But if you’re interested in what I do remember, feel free to message me.

smoothazbutta [info] First and foremost you need to take care of yourself first. How are you coping with your bipolar disorder? Are you on medication? Are you seeing a Dr? Do you have someone you can confide in? Please make sure you are taking care of yourself first because no matter what job you take you will always bring yourself with. If you are not in the right state of mind all jobs will seem horrible.  You are so strong. One of my favorite quotes is "you wake up every morning to fight the same demons that left you so tired the night before, and that, my love, is bravery." The fact that you are still pushing through is so great. Your time spent in publishing was not a waste at all! I am sure you learned some very valuable things while working for a publishing company AND THEN doing freelance work! That's great! Take the things that you learned that you excelled in and bring those to any job you take. (example: I have great customer services skills. Now i worked in an office but I still carry those customer services skills with me to every job). If you really want to go back into publishing have you ever considered reaching out to old contacts and explaining your situation? I know it is extremely hard to talk about mental illness but maybe reaching out and saying "Hey, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 5 months ago. When I was not diagnosed I had a manic episode and did some things that were out of my character but I am now properly diagnosed and doing much better now. Would you consider allowing me to work on a project again?" (only say that if you and your Dr. truly think that you are better.) If your heart isn't set on going back to publishing try something new! Who cares if you don't end up doing the publishing gig anymore. You are the person who has to go in and work that job everyday so YOU might as well enjoy it. There is no expiration date on our goals. Morgan Freeman didn't get his breakout role until he was 52!  Colonel Sanders, was 62 when he started Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)!

Claireheart [info] Ok, before this gets too crazy, a bipolar diagnosis doesn't mean he is incapable to be a father.Just like with anyone else, a bipolar person can be irresponsible and unreliable, but that DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. Obviously, some things may be from bipolar, but bipolar doesn't magically erase someone's personality. If a person is a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible then after the bipolar diagnosis, the person will -still- be a piece of crap human being who is irresponsible.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 13 (early onset caused by trauma), and I have been with my husband nearly 15 years (married since 2009), have a successful career (until I had to stay at home for baby, will get back to it in 6 months to a year depending on baby), graduated college with a 3.8 GPA, etc... etc... just like everyone else....because I am not too different than anyone else. I still have my own personality, I just experience highs and lows. That is the only difference. A lot of people use bipolar as a crutch though, and they always justify their behavior with 'I can't help it, it is my bipolar'. So nothing gets better because they have a built-in excuse to never better themselves. Anyone can work to better themselves and suppress impulse, control energy, force themselves out of bed, etc... That being said, to answer your question, it depends on what kind of person he is. If he doesn't even see a problem with his actions, then he won't change. As a result, he is a danger to your kids as he can't just leave them like you said. As a result, you have to try to protect your children - but this doesn't have to be permanent - he just needs to see a problem and learn how to manage it (most people need professional help to do so).

I always thought that my symptoms were a result of ADHD, but now with my bipolar diagnosis, I am confused. I know it is somewhat common for ADHD to be comorbid with bipolar, but I guess I'm just really antsy and want to know whether or not I have both or not so I can figure out a treatment plan asap. I'm failing my classes, and my whole life is sort of falling apart because I can't focus on anything I do. This triggers mood swings and the cycle begins.Does anyone here ALSO have a BP diagnosis?

Jewcebox [info] Thank you for helping me keep going Long story short I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 shortly after my breakup with my now ex. I had snapped on her due to unregulated bipolar issues a few times, and she finally had enough. She did say she wanted to see where things stood once I was better, so I clung to that hope. Then instead of telling me her feelings changed, she let me cling to that hope until I had to pry an answer out of her. Since the initial breakup, and especially now that I know she led me on for over a month, I've been on here religiously, seeing motivation for people with all sorts of needs, and it's kept me above water.I've been working out and running for the better part of 12 years, since HS really, but the breakup took everything out of me. I didn't want to wake up, go to work, workout, etc. The only thing that kept me going was the motivation and support I've seen in this sub. I wanted to say thank you, this sub is amazing.

Mgerbz [info] I (22F) have realized that I am the toxic one in my relationship &amp; don’t know how to control my emotions. How do I stop being a crazy girlfriend? My boyfriend (25M) &amp;amp; I have been together for over a year now. We got off to a bit of a rocky start because he still talked to his ex the first 6 months of our relationship. He hid it from me, lied to me about multiple things involving their relationship, &amp;amp; refused to tell her he had a girlfriend. This hurt me very deep &amp;amp; caused a lot of problems in our relationship. Finally back in September &amp;amp; told him that if he didn’t at least tell her he had a girlfriend, I would break up with him. After a lot of arguing, he finally agreed &amp;amp; to my knowledge, that is the last time they spoke. Since then, we don’t fight hardly at all, &amp;amp; we have a very loving relationship.I never got over the pain I felt from the situation with his ex. Its a soft spot for me &amp;amp; we don’t talk about it anymore bc I always get very angry &amp;amp; emotional towards him. He has apologized many times &amp;amp; tries his hardest to make sure I know he loves only me. But I can’t get over it.This all came to a tipping point last night, which is the reason i’m writing this post. We were out at a bar with my brother, sister-in-law &amp;amp; some of their friends. One of their friends came over to my boyfriend &amp;amp; told him that he recognized him from being friends with his ex. Something about hearing her name &amp;amp; hearing them talk about her flipped a switch in my brain &amp;amp; I became a completely different person. I got so angry &amp;amp; full of rage. I was already kinda drunk at this point but I immediately just started knocking back drinks to try to calm myself down. Bad idea.I remember bits &amp;amp; pieces of it but it felt like it wasn’t me, like I was watching it happen &amp;amp; I couldn’t control myself. I refused to talk to my bf, kept leaving the bar &amp;amp; running away. At one point I punched a telephone pole &amp;amp; fractured a bone in my hand. I called my mom &amp;amp; screamed at her, saying if she didn’t come pick me up from the city we were in (2 hours from her house) that I would never talk to her again. I was swearing at her &amp;amp; saying very mean things bc she didn’t wanna drive 2 hours in the middle of the night to get me. At one point I went off on the dude who knows my bf’s ex &amp;amp; tried to make him give me her phone number so I could call her. I yelled at my brother for staying with my bf &amp;amp; not being mad at him too. But the worst part, &amp;amp; the part I am most ashamed for, was at one point my bf was trying to talk to me &amp;amp; calm me down &amp;amp; I shoved him. I then took his phone &amp;amp; tried to smash it on the ground (luckily he has an otterbox case). I can’t believe I reacted so harshly &amp;amp; physically. Though i didn’t physically hurt him, I believe that if you don’t want a man to put his hands on you, you shouldn’t put ur hands on them. I would never thought myself able to be so angry for something so small.Last night scared the living shit out of me. Luckily my bf is a saint &amp;amp; didn’t break up with me, but I feel like I don’t deserve for him to stay. I’m so embarrassed &amp;amp; I feel so guilty for the way I treated him. This isn’t me &amp;amp; I don’t know why I lost myself so bad. I’ve apologized to him multiple times, I didn’t justify any of my actions, &amp;amp; I let him be angry with me bc he has every right to be. But I know I fucked up really bad &amp;amp; hurt him &amp;amp; I don’t know what to do. I wanna be the best girlfriend he’s ever had &amp;amp; make him happy, but I can’t let go of the pain he caused me when we first started dating, &amp;amp; i’m taking it out on him in a very unhealthy way.I know very well this is toxic behavior &amp;amp; feel like the biggest piece of shit. This is a very new feeling for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago &amp; it has been something i’ve worked very hard on trying to control, I take medication, go to therapy, etc., but I feel like I’m further back then where I started with my mental health. If anyone could give me some advice on dealing with anger towards ur SO or how to stop being the toxic one in my relationship, i would greatly appreciate it.TLDR: My boyfriend’s relationship with his ex caused a lot of problems in the beginning of our relationship &amp; i’m taking it out on him in an unhealthy way.

jrob1235789 [info] I think only 2 things should change in terms of requirements for future candidates. One is that they should be required to release their tax returns. The second one is that they should have to have a psychiatric or neuropsychological evaluation. And I'm saying that as someone who has a mental illness. Having a mental illness should not disqualify someone from being president, but being mentally unstable should. For example, from 2011-2012 I was mentally unstable before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated for it. Now I have been stable for over 4 years. I am a mental health professional, though not one who is legally allowed to diagnose people, but Donald Trump is clearly not mentally stable. That should disqualify you from being president.

hms_surprise [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 9 months ago and figured out that I had been suffering from minor paranoid delusions for the past 24 years. Side note: I am completely 'normal' now. It's kind of laughable how long I spent being just on the edge of psychotic. No one could ever tell.There were days when I would start climbing and completely derealize (if you've ever been high and had the feeling of waking up over and over again, derealization is like that except scarier). There were other times that I would be in the middle of a route—especially multipitch—and have a full panic attack. Sometimes the weight of the world would hit me while crimping or jamming or anything and my arms would completely lose their ability to grip. There were a lot of uncontrollable tremors and stuff.

They tell me I can appeal the suspension but I haven’t received the paperwork yet. Has anyone been through the appeal process and can tell me what to expect? I had a job interview last week that seems like I have a good shot of being hired even being uncleared for the moment, but in the long term will require a Q. Any thoughts on that?Any info helps and thanks for your time reading this post. [info] None [info] 1542638024
404real [info] I dont know where im going...or what im doing. could use friendly advice. I don't manage money well as it is and while homeless, I relapsed on heroin trying to commit suicide. I had been clean for close to 8 fucking years!  UGH!  im just about clean off of that crap again (3 days running).  For 9 more days, I will literally be broke which will help insure i stay clean again. and then I start getting 2k in my bank every other week.   What should I do first?  Put a large chunk of my next two checks into a vehicle or start paying child support?  How much do I keep back for taxes?  I was homeless for the last 6 months.  I found a couch to crash on recently while I waited for disability to deny my claim again.  To try and make ends meet I got a laptop from my brother and took a contract working remotely as a software developer at a low rate of pay.  I just recently had the balls to renegotiate my contract after the 4th week.  I actually got a decent sized increase in pay. Like very decent...  When im stable.. im a rock star at what I do.  What can I say?  So Now I'm making decent money again, unexpectedly.  I have to figure out what to do about the child support I wasn't able to pay into for the last 8 months.  i dont have a car and my license is suspended because I couldnt to pay a minor ticket for a non-moving violation .I dont know how to summarize this so suffice it to say I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder on multiple occasions by the time I was 21. I was once incarcerated for over a year.  I've been homeless before this last time.  conversely, I was a recognized professional for 4 years running before I lost my job during a custody battle.  My ex took our daughter two towns away and the judge ordered me to get my kid to school on time even though my ex was in violation of our agreement by moving away.  I guess its safe to say after being late for 3 weeks in a row a corporation isn't beyond firing an executive.  I feel overwhelmed.  I dont know what to take care of first and a every decision I make feels like a mistake.  Ive been off my meds for 4 months now to boot.... [info] None [info] 1533605834

elhopem [info] Bipolar runs in my family. Genetically. If it is in your gene line, you’re more susceptible to getting it, but psychologists have found that kids who have genetic based bipolar are less likely to get it if they have a supporting and stable life. However you are almost guaranteed bipolar if you grow up with abuse and neglect of any kind. At least that’s what happened to me. Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I have done extensive research and tried to gather information because it’s such a tricky and intricate mind malfunction that is complicated to understand.

barberos3 [info] 100% agree. One must be cautious with advices of that kind. In my situation I had undiagnosed ADHD for years and each time I felt socially anxious or simply overwhelmed by being in a group, incapable of completing a task because of attention deficit, it nourished my lack of self esteem and social isolation, ending in cycling depressive episodes. That's why I was diagnosed with bipolar first.My doctor wants me to think of this combination of ADHD and bipolar as "intellectual and emotional hyperactivity" rather than a handicap or an illness. He says once it's under control it may even be a super power. And I thought that was a very cool thing to say, it gave me hope and confidence. Telling myself I was ill has contributed to my lack of self esteem. And I just wanted to share, but I understand it may harm other peoples perception of their illness / difference.

EsotericEcology [info] Hey I also have a question for you regarding stimulant induced manic depressive disorder if you feel comfortable answering. I have ADHD so I was on stimulants in my teens. Eventually my behavior became so erratic I was diagnosed with bipolar. Later on, I was misdiagnosed and told my symptoms were from the stimulants which I no longer take. Is that essentially what stimulant induced manic depressive disorder is referring to in this instance? I googled it but I wasn’t finding much information. No worries if you’d rather not talk about this! [info] None [info] 1563461789

Spongekelp [info] Questions about sharing your diagnosis. So in 2008 I was diagnosed with bipolar. Two years ago I realized I'm autistic and I just got the diagnosed a few months ago. A lot of people think I'm NT or bipolar. I'm so tired of hiding my true self and playing neurotypical. I want to tell everyone except some family members who won't understand. What are your experiences with telling people?  I wanted to post this to Facebook but I'm not so sure about using Facebook. "If you haven't heard today National coming out day. While I'm straight, this day has inspired me to announce something I've been keeping quiet and tired of hiding. I'm on the autism spectrum. I keep this a secret because most people are unfamiliar with the traits of autism and tell me "no you're not." I've gone through months of testing and fall on the spectrum and I'm tired of hiding it. If you don't believe me or my doctors please keep your comments to yourself. " [info] None [info] 1444595874
saddlerockets [info] Rilo Kiley, particularly the song, "A Better Son/Daughter." Right before I was diagnosed with bipolar, my husband paid attention to the words of the song (even though he'd heard it many times) and when he got a moment, he texted me and told me to check it out. "I just really feel like this song is about you. It makes me sad." Life was so hard at that time. And that little moment made me feel that, despite my believing I wasn't worthy of it, he really loved and thought of me. Have since branched out to more of her stuff and she really gets it.

Gateway2000PC [info] Just want to say that i relate and fit squarely in this discussion.  I was diagnosed with bipolar at 22 after a breakdown due to a stressful work situation and i flew into a rage triggering lots of hostile emails and faxes (which were an in thing back then)I was put on all these bipolar meds lithium depakote and anti depressants.  I got fatter and angrier but not really better.  At one point i was almost 300 lbs.   i was up to 6 meds a day.   I finally got off all meds myself and had some rocky times before i leveled out in my personal life. Still any kind of stressful associations were tough — work, church , friendships.   a psychologist i met with for a long time finally diagnosed me with BPD in 2013.  Just so i wouldnt get hurt if i needed government benefits he didnt remove the bipolar DX.  Unfortunately - i got a bit borderline with him (LOL) and didnt continue treatment.  I have been through about 28 therapists over the years.Since 2016 - i have taken one med - Risperidone and i would say it helps to take the edge off but it is not a cureThe one thing i have done well is manage my own litte part time consulting business but when things get to stressful or i do work outside my normal routine — a borderline episode springs into beingAbout 6 weeks ago i started DBT therapy.  Its a slow process but the ball is rolling [info] None [info] 1572742365
meradorm [info] She's not a psychiatrist but a psychiatric nurse. Insurance just will not pay for the prescription unless it comes with a diagnosis code, presumably for ADHD. The nurse wants me to have this medicine, but I can't have it until I've been diagnosed with a condition that Medicaid believes that the medication can treat. I don't know if the facility I go to would let my nurse diagnosis me herself, or if she has to wait for the guy with the doctorate (my psychologist) to do it.The inventory is a weird one that matches you up to statistics to see how bad you have it compared to the bell curve. You need a key to use it and can't really make heads or tails of it otherwise. It's possible for anyone to see just by how many boxes I check and how often the symptoms I report affect me that I have an issue, but I don't know if to make a formal diagnosis at this facility they need to sit down and say that according to assessment I'm in 88th percentile of being shit at life. Or whatever. Again, I don't know what red tape they have to go through where I'm getting care at. (I know they have some very specific criteria at the facility about prescribing benzodiazapenes like Xanax, under what circumstances they can be prescribed, and for how long the shrinks can keep the patients on them, as only short-term prescriptions are allowed. I don't know what their criteria are for ADHD diagnosis and treatment or even if they have any at all.)Being a Medicaid patient my options are also limited and this is the best treatment I've gotten anywhere by far. I can't really leave. Essentially I just want to know if Medicaid will fill a scrip for Vyvanse if my psychiatric nurse tells them I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or if they want the diagnosis to be specifically ADHD. Hoping someone who's been in the same situation might know.  [info] None [info] 1514530050

prufrockbabe666 [info] I'm a sex addict (10 months sober yesterday). Even most of the people in my 12 step group ( which is AA, because SAA/ SLAA/ SA in my town feels very unsafe) don't know. Even though my obsession about / compulsion toward sex got a lot better when I was diagnosed with bipolar and got on meds, as a woman it is horrible to try to tell people you're a sex addict because people either think you're trying to get attention or that it's hot. I'm really worried that my friends or family member will find pictures of me on the internet because I sent them to so many people when I was acting out. My other really big secret is that while I was manic and sleeping around with a lot of people (because mania / manic hypersexuality + compulsive sexuality is like the worst combination, ever), I was raped by a stranger, as I was hooking up with his girlfriend. The only people who know this are one of my sisters, one close cousin, my therapist and my current partner. And only my therapist and my partner knows the circumstances. Being bipolar is also a pretty big secret (Mom knows but I haven't told Dad and I told her not to tell him as well). Beyond my partner, my one sibling, my AA home meeting, and my therapist, only my graduate advisor, who struggles with her own chronic invisible illnesses knows.  [info] None [info] 1518442811

jacobgmiller01 [info] Caffeine and bipolar ii? Hi all,I was diagnosed with bipolar ii earlier this spring and one of the things that I read was that caffeine can throw you into a hypomanic state and should be afforded. Even before my diagnosis I would drink caffeine because it would make me "feel better." I've continued to do this now and it has always worked for me. Caffeine seems to be like a pick me up whenever I'm feeling especially down. Had anyone else experienced this? Is it fine to do this? [info] Rapid Cycling [info] 1565688431
TheGMan323 [info] Be as understanding and forgiving as possible. If she snaps at you when she's angry, don't yell at her. Realize that she is not in control of her emotions most of the time and did not really mean to yell at you. If she is crying at some restaurant and making a scene, don't let your parents (or someone else) pester her to stop crying. Comfort her, but give her her space. Even if she's acting out in front of people and possibly aggravating you in the process, try to remain calm and treat the situations as delicately as possible. Don't ever make her feel like she's not normal--because she is normal. Also, **THIS IS A BIG ONE**: Do not go around telling every person you know that she is bipolar unless your sister specifically tells you it is okay to do that (or asks you to, for some reason). I love my mother, but when I was diagnosed with bipolar she had a tendency to tell almost anyone she talked to that I had bipolar disorder and this led to most people treating me like I was some specimen at a museum who shouldn't be touched or breathed on the wrong way. "Oh, hiiii. How are yooooou doing?" They were talking to me like I was mentally challenged or something. (Not to insult the mentally challgenged.) Make her feel like she's normal and just as cool as everyone else--because she is! Edit: And yes, being available for her to talk to you is important. I have a very, very loving family, but a lot of times when I talk to them about something that is very important to me, they quickly tune out of the conversation and just try to pretend like they're listening. There is nothing more hurtful than this. Either give her 100% of your attention or don't give her any. She will know the difference. Also, I just have to say it is very encouraging to see a post like this. Please let your sister know that the teen years are the worst emotionally (especially for bipolar people), but it gets better after that.  [info] None [info] 1324402041
babykittenbella [info] I’m an adult child. At age 32 I suffered an episode of mania. My mother comitted me to an insititution involuntarily, and I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have been stable since, but am suffering severe consequences of the meds and social stigma around mental illness. It sounds like your son needs help very urgently. I did too at the time. However... Today I am scared of my mother and SO, because of the trauma of getting me help. There was paramedics and police involved, I was taken to a hospital in handcuffs, even though I never hurt anyone including myself. I have forgiven them, but will never ever forget. I think it might have been better if they had explained to me that I could go voluntarily, if not they had the power to rob me of my rights and would get it done without my consent. I might have gone on my own... Good luck! [info] None [info] 1554653681

kkstoimenov [info] Yes, absolutely. My brain fog is almost entirely gone. I find it much easier to focus on my goals and my "ideal self." I've also been meditating daily throughout, so that's helped.Downsides have been sleep, emotional regulation and relaxation. I only had my first dream 2 days ago. I've been finding it very difficult to manage my mood (I'm diagnosed with bipolar so this is a big part as well.)

I had an extremely high IQ, test grades, etc.  Weird thing is I had Epilepsy.I sucked at math though and still do, so anything related...nothing.I never went to college because every degree requires Algebra 1 &amp; 2 and I honestly don't know how to do it.  As an adult I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I work retail for minimum wage and make below the poverty level.  I've considered going to college again recently but the math is what always stops me.

But I guess now isn’t the time because I’ve got to help myself first. It doesn’t help that my mom downplays our emotional problems a lot, and she doesn’t like that I’m going to be taking medication long-term.

pero_dero [info] Will try to keep it short:My american football coach had just started talking with the national team and colleges in the US for me to start playing for them. I tore a ligament in my groin during a match and the doctors found out I had an anomaly in my hip so I had to undergo a surgery, which meant no more football or MMA.The two sports were my way to vent all the negativity I had so I became heavily depressed. I started drinking heavily, even got to school drunk sometimes. Then drugs came into the picture and I eventually had a psychosis.Lateron I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, which I dealt with. Had a good period where I started in college, but shortly after I dropped out and went back to my drug abuse. I'm 22 now and the struggle is over, it was 3 1/2 dark years, and I remember little. I'm going to study sports science in the best university for sports science in my country. To be stable I had to stop doing drugs, never get more than tipsy when drinking, and **keep a routine** to stay active and get out of bed every morning.  [info] None [info] 1404235633
Shylamb [info] Was doing great, but feeling off now... I was diagnosed with bipolar in high school, got lots of therapy and was on medications for many many years. I finally weaned off the meds in grad school when I was trying to get pregnant with my son. I continued therapy and was doing great. I even got to a point where I stopped therapy. My son is now 5, and I have a 3 year old daughter as well. I'm usually pretty good at noticing an episode come on, and managing it well-I think I have a pretty mild form as I find that now I have better coping skills I am as functional as anyone else. However, recently I've been having surprise episodes of despair or mania-the mania is short lived and manageable, but my depressive episodes are getting harder and harder to manage. I feel like I'm not as good a mom as I could be or was before, and well, you probably know the drill. I'm emotional and I'm not being a good person to my husband or kids I feel. I've considered going back to therapy, but finding the time is hard. I do not want to go back on meds. I guess, in the end I'm just looking for a little support, and do you think it's possible I went into remission for a few years and it's just now coming back?Edit: sorry for any typos, I'm posting his from my iPad while I hid from my kids in the bathroom.

I was prescribed lamotrigine and sometimes it works and sometimes i feel all mixed moody again. I was on 100 but the side effects were really getting to me (i even got a rash that lasted for 2 week/!) So I moved down to 50, but the symptoms started to return so now i’m on 75. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. Today i feel all mixed moody again. I literally feel like mush. I keep forgetting the day and the month and my own age even.

Today, all those ambitions went flat. I don’t even know what’s a symptom and what’s not.Sometimes I wonder if I truly have bipolar or maybe I have another MI? Maybe I’m on the wrong medication?

analogthunder [info] I'm overwhelmed by the suffering I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, but I'm pretty sure I have bpd, since my emotions have always been very extreme and magnified. In the past few years my life's been getting shittier and so much better at the same time. I got unexpectedly pregnant 2 years ago in a not very good situation and my son has given me the motivation and the strength and really, is making my life worth living. On the other hand my realionship with his father was emotionally abusive and has broken me completely, I broke up with him in August but we have a kid together so we're still constantly fighting. When my baby has to go with him (he's not a bad father, he could do much better, but he's not the worst) my heart shatters, I'm in complete agony, not so much for my son, I know he has a lot of fun with his father, but for me, for everything I miss. My baby lives with me and spends most of his time with me since I only have a few hours of work atm, but I'm trying to get more, and hopefully will soon, and I'm studying, so I feel that everytime I spend and will spend less time with him. So I'm in a constant sway between feeling so lucky and thankful that I get to be this little man's mom and feeling the worst pain because I can't give him the life I wanted for him and guilt that we can't be together.And really, comparing, my situation isn't THAT bad, but I'm in so much pain that life's barely worth living. I can just imagine what mom's are going through that have sick babies, or can't feed them or clothe them. I don't know, I'm just overwhelmed and extremely frustrated and disappointed in the human society. I am loosing all my hope for something better and my ability to see the good in people has always been my lifeboat, now I can only see complete, selfish assholes.Thanks if you read my rant, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this but I just thought you guys would be the most understanding of how overwhelmed I feel right now.

MeyerLink [info] Where I am and where I've been. I keep posting in other people's threads with advice or consolation or whatever so I figured it was only fair that I introduced myself in this subreddit.  I am a guy if anybody is wondering.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with a psychotic component when I was about 7 by one of the few doctors that belived in childhood onset bipolar disorder at the time.  Now it's no longer a controversy.  Had my family not kept taking me to differet doctors and pushing until they found out what was wrong, I don't know where I'd be today.Did the mood stabilizer thing.  I responded well to lithium. I was on anti psychs for a good while.  A long time later in high-school I was diagnosed with adhd, but there was a chance that the meds would exacerbate my mood swings so I didn't do anything about it until recently.In college I went off my meds.  It was a disaster. I became even more withdraw than I had been in highschool.  I couldn't deal socially.  I wound up putting myself in some really bad situations.  Luckily, I am a good students so my grades were good.After college I decided to get back on my meds and to work on my problems.  I created a good circle of friends, all of whom I trust completely.  They have never let me down.  I started on a path that led to a career.Other than one awful year (my career nearly went in the trash, but it's all good now) I have been steadily doing better every year.  I have become more social.  I picked up some fun weird hobbies including roll playing games, hypnosis (super fun, actually), and martial arts.  I have had a few relationships.  I have ended them all because I haven't quite found what I am looking for.  Each one has been better than the last, and I have gotten over 9000 times better at dealing with the opposite sex.  I continue to push myself out of my comfort zone and it seems to have given me a better handle on myself because my mood swings are pretty mild these days when they come at all.  I also have a phenomenal psychiatrist and am on a good coctail of meds right now so I am sure that helps quite a bit too.  I feel pretty lucky that I have always had the support of my family, and that I now have the support of great friends.  I don't know where I'd be without them. [info] None [info] 1376414364
unwinding_cablecar [info] Hey! I have bipolar and I have been happily dating a girl for a few months :\) she is very understanding and helps me when things get rough. I was diagnosed about a year ago after multiple episodes and have worked through a DBT program and keep up to date with my meds; I've been stable since! A few dates in the past fizzled out once I told them I was a person with bipolar:/ I think it's key to keep managing your health and well\-being, first and foremost. I was married when my mental health issues started at the age of 25, and the person left me because I was diagnosed with bipolar. Probably for some it seems like something scary, maybe because they don't understand or have experience with someone with bipolar. My best advice would be to let people see who you are first, that you aren't really different than anyone else. You just have an illness that you are managing! Personally, I like to be upfront and honest as soon as possible, but everyone is different. For instance, I disclosed to an employer that I had bipolar and was fired a few weeks later... it is challenging, but know that there are people out there who support you and that you are still the same person! I'm still struggling with that, but things will and do get better with time! Wishing you the best :\)  [info] None [info] 1526482175

SunChild91 [info] I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was diagnosed with bipolar (and they definitely directly correlated) I still try to stay away from mirrors and I practically avoid showering even, but then I will completely binge eat for days, hate myself more, not eat, and so the cycle continues! I have started eating pretty much a zero fat diet, I stick to fruits veggies quinoa tea instead of coffee (although caffeine could definitely have something to do with it, I had to quit when I was first diagnosed, it had pretty much kept me hypo for like 5 years)etc.. That way things like yoghurt or a grilled cheese become really filling and satisfying like junk food. I seem to just become immediately addicted to sugar I feel like it does something to our bipolar chemical make up. If I don't have sugar like chocolate or something, I don't over eat as badly.. Oh and milo is good! I'm not sure if you get that in America but it's like hot chocolate and if you switch to tea (which also hydrates and detoxes and helps with weight loss!) after drinking tea all day if you get cravings for chocolate trust me, it's totally satisfying! Hope some of this helps...  [info] None [info] 1466725001

cupcakeninja2 [info] [Support] Meet my mother To get a little bit of an idea about my family read my post [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1uvvr6/long_story_but_need_to_vent/) in /r/parenting Follow up to that post:After I reported my mother to the authorities she decided to take revenge and filed a false report against me to CPS. I met with a caseworker and they determined that everything in my home is fine and my children are healthy and safe. So nothing came of it except wasting everyone's time and resources. I made a decision to try to fight my mother for guardianship of my disabled aunt. It seems the APS caseworker fell for their lies and fake smiles so that is the only other thing I can think to do to protect my aunt. After talking with my therapist about all of these issues I decided to see if there was any way I could force my mother to get a psychiatric evaluation. Well, the ONLY thing my mother cares about is money and her job. So I contacted her work and asked them if they could help me. In turn, they fired her. It was not my intention for her to get fired but the bitch in me is doing a happy dance because payback is a bitch. And now maybe she will hit rock bottom and try to get help for herself. Now, I do NOT want any form of contact with any of those people in my "family". I do not initiate any conversation, I live in another state and I just want them all permanently out of my life. I recognize that they are a bad influence in my life and the lives of my children. But every few days I get random texts from various members of my family.  They harrass me and accuse me and threaten me. And I just want them out of my life completely. I want to move on and just be happy with me little family. About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've had my ups and downs with meds and am currently not on any. I am waiting to get an appointment with my psychiatrist to get back on meds but it's not until the middle of May. So now I'm wondering if it was the right thing for me to do all those things. Maybe I took it a little to far. They are still my family, after all. Maybe I shouldn't try to fight for my aunt because maybe my mother will change after having the APS caseworker visit. They keep telling me that one day I'll need them and nobody will be there for me. But I know that I have my husband and his family, as well as my children who will stand by me through anything. Last night I looked up the definition of sociopath. I found [this]( http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/basics/symptoms/CON-20027920) list of symptoms for antisocial personality disorder. It all fits my mother to a T. I can go on for days about my childhood and how my mother has been throughout my adult life. This just makes sense. But what worries me is that some of those symptoms/traits fit me as well. My fear is that I'll become just like her. Mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed and many are hereditary. And now all I can think about is my poor young boys having to grow up with a crazy mother just like I did. Now I question whether or not I may be a sociopath and I fear for my children and how they will grow up if this is true. Maybe if I push my "family", specifically my mother, far enough away.. maybe I can save myself from becoming her. I just want to go on with my life and forget they exist because they bring out the worst in me. But how can I do that if they continue to text and call me? And what do I do when my oldest son continues to ask to see/call his grandmother? [info] None [info] 1391613440
Goldenboy451 [info] So this is a bit of a weird, personal...thing; I'm not even sure I'd really call it a question, more of a 'thank you'.Round about the time I was starting my final year of uni, I was in a pretty bad way. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for a couple of years, and medication can only really do so much. A few years earlier, I'd spent months doing little more than reading &amp; listening to music, since it was just about the only thing that could get me out of my own head. I ended up reading Kieron Gillen &amp; Jamie McKelvie's 'Phonogram: The Singles Club', which turned out to be just what I needed. It was something I really ended up identifying with, and gave me a lot of cause for thought.So when Jamie posted a couple of your early tracks; ZVVL and Science/Visions on his Twitter towards the start of my final year, I had to check them out. Each one of your tracks made me feel something I hadn't felt about music in a long time: excited. Along with some other synth &amp; pop albums, your early demos and live sessions were a constant on my playlist; during the months I was feeling shitty and deeply suicidal, there was some relief in just putting on a great track that was quite unlike anything else, and you guys were a big part of that.So I guess that's a long-winded way of saying that you guys have played a pretty big part in my life the last 18 months or so; both times I've seen you live you were absolutely fantastic, and I really look forward to seeing where you go in the future.Iain, Martin &amp; Lauren - thank you, and thanks for taking the time to read the angst of an early-twenty-something.  [info] None [info] 1396470432

Whatsthatskip [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II a few years ago (possibility of type I, but no hospitalization), but I knew long before my official diagnosis.  I have two wonderful, happy children and an amazing husband and this was my motivation for getting treatment.  I have to be healthy for them.  I was lucky to find a meds combo that works well for me, and spent a lot of time doing CBT and researching the illness.  My husband has been very supportive and helps me keep on track (with diet, exercise, sleep and stress management).  We had to make adjustments in our lifestyle, but it's been healthier for everyone.  Bipolar is like diabetes in many ways.  I hope you don't mind me sharing my experience.  I really hope your wife will get the treatment she needs, for all of your sake.  You may have already done this, but I would suggest you have a very candid talk about how it affects you and your kid, but make sure you do it when she is not in an episode.  If she won't seek treatment with full knowledge of how it affects her family, then it would be time to talk honestly about the consequences.  From one internet stranger to another, it is possible to have a healthy relationship and I sincerely hope that you and your wife can get the help you need. [info] None [info] 1397337346

dasoomer [info] It's a long story, but I'll truncate it. I was on the tail end of a 10 day party. I started in Austin for the F1 race, flew to Albuquerque, and flew to Vegas. There was a lot of alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA to help fuel the way.I stayed up the entire night doing MDMA and started drinking at breakfast prior to boarding my flight. I continued to drink on the plane and was sufficiently trashed when I landed. A buddy picked me up and we went back to his place. Needless to say I was sufficiently exhausted and needed to grab a few hours of sleep prior to continuing. This was my first experience with sleep paralysis and it TERRIFIED me. It was the worst experience of my life. I wanted to scream but couldn't. I tried rolling off of the bed with no luck. Regardless of what I did, nothing brought me out of it. I have no idea how long it was, but I know once I came out of it I started googling what was wrong. I looked through all of the potential causes and stopped after I counted 6 items that could have caused it. Once back home, I really reflected on everything and decided I needed professional help.

I was diagnosed with bipolar, and possibly co-morbidly with Borderline Personality Disorder (currently awaiting test results), three years ago and I also believe I have an array of other disorders that usually come with Asperger’s such as OCD, Dyslexia, and SPD. I feel really shittily about myself and I feel like I’m screwing up a perfectly good relationship, as I always seem to do. We haven’t been together that long, but we’re already in love, and I know he would marry me if I somehow keep from being so difficult. Problems that always seem to be an issue in our relationship are things like my constant need for affection, which doesn’t bother him, and reassurance. I’m compulsively checking and rechecking everything including how he and I are feeling to make sure we are still okay. I am also very paranoid, anxious, and have psychotic episodes. I know the reasons why I do everything I do, which has a lot to do with my childhood and also genetics. I know I am a very kind, talented, and relatively funny person, but it still doesn’t make me feel any better about myself as far as holding on to the first guy I’ve dated that accepts and loves me for everything I am. He is so amazing but I still know that he is human and will get tired of my insecurities eventually.

Cheeseballfairy [info] Zenzedi (Dexadrine) has changed my life in the best way possible I have had ADHD my entire life. I was always the weird annoying kid that never stopped talking. When I was in middle school, I tried Adderall and Adderrall XR, but the side effects outweighed the benefits (which were miniscule).I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 17. This complicated things a little, as so many side effects overlap, and the treatment for ADHD and for mania is different. After a good combo of mood stabilizers was found, the ADHD symptoms were still very much present, but I was able to work with it and still function fairly well and succeed in college, with the exception of social problems.At the age of 19, I got a bad concussion resulting in post-concussion disorder. With this compounding the ADHD symptoms, my daily life was significantly impaired by forgetfullness, concentration problems, and complete lack of motivation. My relationships suffered. People were understanding, but I was hard to hold a conversation with. I tried Adderall, Adderrall XR, and ritalin. We settled on Adderall. I did not like it very much and only took it on days I felt it was necessary. It didn't really help, it just took the edge off a little. But the come down at night was awful. My doctor offered one last option: zenzedi.Zenzedi, also called dexadrine, contains only one of the ingredients in Adderrall. There a couple side effects, but I have not had any whatsoever, and I'm usually the person who gets all the side effects.This is the first time in my life that I have felt like a normal person. I never realized that this is what a person should feel like and this is how they should think.I wake up without an alarm and feel awake. I want to get up and get my day started. I have to-do lists that I check and follow. I'm aware of my shortcomings and create routines that help me cope with them. I do things before they are due. I can do math in my head. I clean and organize. I feel like my goals are attainable and I know what to do to attain them. And I do it. I shower and brush my hair and put on makeup. I know what comes next. All of those things I just said have never happened before in my entire life. It's as if I'm in a state of hypomania all the time, but without the bad parts. It feels like my brain went from a tornado scene to a library. I still ramble, I still get distracted, I'm still me. But now I know what to do with me. I promise I'm not trying to promote this drug. This is just my personal experience to let others know that if you think you are out of options, you might not be. However, it's relatively expensive, it's new, and you won't find any pharmacy that  doesn't have to order it. tl:dr zenzedi is a lesser known ADHD medication that has given me drastically better treatment with no side effects.

niknak90 [info] Strattera is available as a generic. Either that or I am taking a mysterious unknown substance. It’s called atomoxetine, which autocorrected to “stomp stone” at first. I can relate to the feeling of hating having to take meds to feel “normal”. I was diagnosed with bipolar after a dramatic manic episode, so I’ve been on meds for a while. I think the diabetes comparison is apt, as it’s also a chronic condition that needs meds.

Elriuhilu [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I know what it's like to be actually depressed. I've been in situations where I thought about jumping off a building or something and I can tell you one thing, I never discussed it with anyone until after I decided not to do it. If I did kill myself, I would do it privately somewhere that people wouldn't watch or try and stop me. People who announce how depressed they are for pity points annoy the hell out of me because they're behaving like a life ruining illness is trendy. So, with that said, I agree with Chaim Witz there to a point, that people who make a great big show of killing themselves and make sure everyone knows about it are probably doing it for attention. That's not to say that they don't have issues, but they should talk to someone instead of preemptively traumatising their friends and family with something they might not even be committed to.

Jezabelle426 [info] The biggest thing is that it can actually take 3 to 6 months to get the full effect of the medication. If he's like me, where in the winter months it gets worse, he may need to start taking something,  if it's new, in late summer or fall. My previous doctors would have me on a combination of things for a month and if it didn't seem to be helping they would constantly change it. The pharmacist I spoke with (who had specialized in medications pertaining to mental health), told me to find a doctor and/or therapist who would listen to me and be patient. Best advice ever. I hope it all works out for him (and you). It's not an easy thing for either party to endure. My dad is manic depressant and I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I've had my share.

RCampbellSproul [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II as well. I for about a year or so I was diagnosed as major depressive, but about three months ago my psychiatrist noticed some patterns of hypomania and changed my diagnosis. I definitely know what you mean about not wanting to tell people about bipolar, and I agree about the stigma. I was willing to tell my friends or even acquaintances I was depressed, but I have a lot of fears about social consequences about telling people I'm bipolar. I've told a few of my closest friends who have all been very kind and supportive (which is of course a huge part of what makes them close friends) but outside of that I generally don't tell folks. I definitely struggle the most with the mood swings, particularly because when I'm hypomanic I can't sleep. At first it feels really good, but after a while of sleeping too little, things start to get pretty bad for me. I hope you get better, I know that this has been incredibly hard for me so I assume it is for others too.  [info] None [info] 1469840667

Manassisthenew6pack [info] When I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after having a psychotic break and needing to be committed, after that I ended up dropping out of college and basically looking to drug use as the only novel thing I did that gave me an identity. I moved back to the small town I was originally going to college in, and began attending a technical school where I would binge on adderall the night before an exam and stay up for 12 hours straight to pass the exams. Because I liked adderall so much I made an appointment with a psychiatrist, who proceeded to give me mood stabilizers but wasn't convinced I needed adderall. In the process of getting adjusted to mood stabilizers instead of the anitpsychotics I had been taking (and stopped taking), things had to get worse before they could get better, and my moods got into new weird areas, to the point where I wasn't comfortable just drinking my feelings away because they would come roaring back when I was drunkest. In light of this, I went to the gym nearly every day, no routine just going as hard as possible for 2ish hours a day trying to exhaust myself. That was all about 8 months ago, I've just been working in fast food since that happened, and my use of everything has precipitiously fallen off to nill at this point, I'm even on a five week quitting smoking streak right now. Lifting just keeps me sane I guess. [info] 165x1 [info] 1418328453

amareevita [info] Not sure if this is quite what you're looking for, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've been with my SO for two years, and I was diagnosed a few months before I started dating him. It was really rough at the start. I was still figuring it out and he didn't know any triggers... but to be fair, neither did I. Now, it's easier. I'm on medication for it and I am *strict* about taking them daily. I go to cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. We live together, so I know it's harder for him in that way. I try very hard to not show him the very worst moments, like the panic attacks, for example. I have them daily, but we're away from each other for most of the day, and see each other at night at home. He knows I have them, but he's never had one (I'm happy for him about that), so he won't exactly understand. It would stress him out greatly to see me in panic attack mode. He has before, because I wake up from sleep with them (when I can sleep, that is). He'll wake up right along with me and stay up with me for hours, talk to me, rub my back, and help me breathe. He is incredibly patient and understanding for being 21 (sounds bad, but I hope you understand what I mean).I don't want to lose him because of this. At the same time, I know it's incredibly difficult to be in a relationship with me. I try my hardest to be fair, but sometimes, some days, it just wins out. It's like dating two people at once, depressed me and then manic me. I am as open as I can be with him, but I don't lean every aspect of this diagnosis on him. Some days are better than others. It's incredibly difficult sometimes, but I really think how you approach it, attitude wise, is what matters. If you take your meds, go to therapy, and communicate, hopefully you can find someone who loves you despite your mental stability. Someone who doesn't see it as the thing that defines you, but rather something that is just another part of you.  [info] None [info] 1492746057
The_Durandal [info] I am also diagnosed schizophrenic, schizoaffective bipolar to be exact.  I was diagnosed with bipolar originally about 15 years ago, which changed about 8 years ago to my current diagnosis, and have been on a variety of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxyiolitics, and lithium, for most of that time.  Currently I am not on any medication from a Psychiatrist.I use a custom stack myself;Lion's Mane for Nerve Growth Factor,Omega-3 for nerve repair and dopamine receptor health,Brahmi (a plant that is a bacopa monnieri source)  for GABA receptor health and sometimes for sedative effect if I feel overstimulated.I have been addicted to alcohol 4 times in the past year, since I went off of my antipsychotics and lithium I was prescribed.  That is why my stack is so heavily skewed to nervous system health, as alcohol withdrawal damages the nervous system badly. There are two other aspects in my recovery that are helping tremendously.  One is sleep.   I've focused heavily on my sleep hygiene; I stop doing anything intense at around 10:30, I drink a reishi + red tea tea around that time, then 2-3 cups of a calming lemon tea to prepare myself for bed around 12:15am.  That works for me and I've had a ton of problems with sleep in my life (I've had sleep paralysis around 50-70 times in the past year as well).The other is socializing.  Working with my psychiatrist, I was given referrals for social activities such as addiction services, mental health support meetings, etc.  These are helpful as schizophrenia lends itself to isolation and drug abuse is a common effect from that isolation.This is working fairly well for me now and my sleep is improving as well.  I am engaging a lot more in the community and that is encouraging, and encouraging me to attempt more engagements as well.That's my 2 (or 20) cents.  Good luck whatever you decide and whatever happens. [info] None [info] 1564922393
schlongbottom [info] I was just diagnosed with bipolar type 1 less than 2 weeks ago, after my first manic ep (I think I was lucky to be purely positive in my mania). Before intake, I called my mom and she said to draw while in the psych ward, because when you draw, you can see yourself. Thank you for sharing this amazing art and insight into your mind, and inspiring me to get to know myself better! [info] None [info] 1573049676

d0pemagik [info] Bipolar diagnosis, not sure it's right. Need advice. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with borderline personality traits a few months ago. I was prescribed 5mg of abilify and for the first few weeks it seemed to be working fabulously. Now, I'm noticing I'm far more angry with little to no affect on my manic highs or lows. I've had some side effects since taking the medicine such as muscle spasms, headaches, insomnia and intense rage. Before therapy, I was 100% convinced I had BPD. Every symptom perfectly depicted my situation. But when I went into therapy i didn't bring it up because I didn't want to self diagnose. When first diagnosed as bipolar the symptoms were close enough to my feelings I felt perhaps I was bipolar. Now I'm second guessing my diagnosis. I guess I'm searching for others who were convinced they had bpd but were diagnosed with bipolar or something similar to my own diagnosis. I want to know if perhaps I am bipolar just on the wrong medicine or if I need to address more of my BPD traits with my doctor. Please let me know if there is a better subreddit for this. I just need some clarification and some answers. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1444625737

scubasam6 [info] Controlling irritability? Hey everyone, looking for some advice. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (amongst other diagnoses) 3  years ago but I still feel like I lack the skills to handle mood swings and episodes. Lately I’ve been hypomanic and especially irritable. The irritability is causing me to become irritated with people easily and I’ve been snapping at friends and loved ones. I’ve been kinda mean to people close to me and I feel so bad that I can’t control my temper. Does anyone have any tips to control the feeling or irritation? I find that every little inconvenience drives me crazy and i automatically react rather than responding.  Any tips are helpful!  TL;DR  I’m having a hypomanic episode and I can’t control my irritation/frustration with things and people. [info] None [info] 1541388668

han-duo [info] Could these symptoms be a result of long term lamictal and zoloft use? To preface, I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on April 7th. I visit her every three months for my medication management.I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder about five years ago. I am a 22 year old female. After trying numerous medications, we found an effective treatment with zoloft and lamictal, which I have been taking for about a year and a half, maybe two years.I started noticing some odd symptoms in October of 2017, but brushed them off as being unrelated. However, I am noticing that they have been getting worse pretty quickly within the past month or two. I'm starting to wonder if they could be a side effect of these medications due to long term use. Is this common? Or even possible?? I researched the symptoms (I apologize; I know this is generally frowned upon by medical professionals, but I couldn't help myself because I was becoming pretty concerned) and a lot of them seemed to match up. Here is a list of all of the symptoms I'm experiencing that I can recall at the moment.--often uncoordinated/dizzy --difficulty articulating my thoughts/processing information/completing tasks.  (for example, this whole post took me way too long to type. I couldn't think of the right words to use, no matter how simple they were. It's very frustrating as I was always considered a very bright girl. Additionally, I work in retail. A task that should take an hour on average takes me two and half to three hours.) --memory loss. I often forget what was said during conversations. (I forget questions asked/answers received, stories told, etc.) --involuntary twitching of my neck/head (my head jerks to the side violently and usually becomes very painful. If this progresses over a along period of time, it starts moving down my body, starting withmy back, next my arms, and then my legs. I sometimes lose the ability to walk due to the severity.) --hearing loss and rapid worsening of vision, both nearsightedness and long distance--incredibly vivid nightmares and dreams, sometimes lucid. I remember my dreams clearly every morning. I often confuse them with reality. --difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. --constant and severe pain throughout my entire body--Severe fatigue--irritability--gastritis, esophagitis, constipation--difficulty breathing/quickly exhausted --more frequent panic attacks I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I thought I should include plenty of background info as well as everything I experience that is very out of the ordinary. Do you think that this could be caused by my meds, or is it possible that it is something completely unrelated? If so, any ideas as to what it could be? Or should I not worry and continue to brush it off? Do you recommend I bring this up to my psychiatrist? She is very condescending and dismissive, so I'm kind of nervous to do so. Any help is appreciated! [info]  [info] 1521784988

thriller107 [info] Bipolar and ADHD? Hey everyone,I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year and a half ago, and I've done a lot of self-reflection since then. One of the things I've noticed is that I generally have a really hard time staying focused for long periods of time. It's never affected my grades, but it definitely took me longer to finish assignments throughout school than most other kids. I read recently that up to 70% of people with bipolar disorder also have ADHD. What have your experiences been?Also, how does one go about treating both conditions? Adderall, being a stimulant, does not mix well with BD. Are we just screwed? Lol [info] None [info] 1578435956
drifter265 [info] flunked out of college twice now I have a hard time finishing things. I only made it to the end of my sophomore year of high school because I dropped out. At 18-19 I finally got my GED without having to study for it and in 2011 (at 20) I started community college. Two and a half years later and I got my AA with a 3.83 GPA. Come fall of 2013 I started at a big time university. Oh what a nightmare. I was 22 (almost 23) and I was only taking three classes at the time. I dropped out of two and scored a c- in the third. The next quarter I took three classes again and this time failed two and got a c- in another. I took a break after that and jumped around different fast food jobs until I wanted to go back to school in 2016 (I was 24). I went back to the same university and my first quarter was great and I got two A’s and a C. Then the next quarter I got a B and two D’s. I got expelled. I really suck. Now I’m 25 and looking to go back to the same university to get my degree still. They’ll let me back in if I petition or take four community college courses and earn a 3.3 GPA and I’ve already done the former. I can’t believe this is how my life is going.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the end of my last quarter where I got two D’s. I was put on a 72-hour psychiatric hold for suicide prevention and am now medicated with mood-stabilizers and anti-depressants. I don’t feel great but just normal and not a good normal. A normal that’s just normal. It’s being at the baseline all the time. Each day emotionally is the same for me. I don’t get happy and I don’t get sad anymore. I do get sad but only for a little bit; mostly I get frustrated and bored. I used this reason in my petition and hopefully they accept it and in six months I can go back to try again. I want these meds to work and have my disorder be the answer to why I failed and couldn’t repeat my success I had with community college. My GPA at university is now a 1.80 and if I just retake the classes I failed and did poor in by a letter grade, it would bring my GPA up to a 2.50. I don’t know where I’m going with this. Maybe I’m just stupid. I do remember being heavily depressed in college and skipping classes and not turning in assignments. I always tried to be the first one done in a test because I couldn’t focus for that long and just tried to answer the questions really quick. I told my psychiatrist that I might have ADD (this was after I dropped out for the second time) but she doesn’t think I have it but hopefully I’ll have convinced her by the time school comes around because I really think it would help.I feel lost. I was doing so well and now I’m not. I feel the only answer after this if I don’t get my degree is to kill myself because what’s the point of living anymore if you’re just going to be a failure for your whole life? I need some advice.

Big_Rig_Jig [info] Since I was a sophomore in highschool I've been 6' tall and never heavier than 150 pounds, usually floating around 140. I get made fun of, or told I need to eat more all the time. I'm extremely self conscious about it now. I don't like people seeing me with a shirt off cause I'm afraid of getting some negative shit coming my way. I really think the US doesn't even know what a healthy person looks like anymore; from the media's unrealistic expectations and our alarming rate of obesity, how could you really expect someone to?Never thought I'd ever have to diet, I started keto/carnivore when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Pretty amazing results so far. Only a few months into it, but my mental stability and clarity haven't been this good since before I hit puberty and a lot of bipolar symptoms started showing up.

RR_fightclub [info] Temporary blindness and some more 18F, 174 cm 62 kg and whiteLately i've noticed reoccurring episodes of almost total blindness. Unable to read from my phone or distinguish shapes. First time it happened was 2-3 weeks ago. My left eye was alright but when I covered it I couldn't find my way in my own room.I'm diagnosed with bipolar, currently taking promethazine and adderall. I do smoke weed daily and deink. Details that may help: I felt some itching, heaviness and uneasiness in my eyes. I wasn't maintaining hand hygiene (6 on the 1-10 scale) during quarantine and I was handling flowers, dirt and turpentine. I did rub my eyes often and the two worst episodes happened directly after rubbing. Never had eye problems before.Edit: I went to a doctor yesterday morning, she wasn't able to find anything wrong. All she said was go to the ER next time it happens. [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1585777771
quesojacksoncat [info] I used to work as a behavioral counsellor for a residential treatment home for developmentally and physically disabled adults.  We took the ones who had been kicked out of other homes because their behaviors were too violent, extreme and disturbing for those homes. I quickly learned that as the staff we were expected to risk our lives and wellbeing for these clients with zero back up from management in regards to our safety &amp; well-being.Here's a few examples:&amp;#x200B;My main client, a 28 year old woman with violent tendencies towards herself and others (she's put people in the hospital and has nearly lost several limbs and a breast because her self-harm is so severe... she's used an uncooked piece of rice on her skin hard enough to open a vein and don't even get me started with what she can do with a plastic button.. She managed slit her throat quite deep with a broken button once). Anyhow, I worked with this woman in her small apartment along with one other staff member around for support if needed. I'm a 120lb female and while I was confident in my ability to restrain her if needed, she could easily get the upper hand if I was caught off guard and do some serious damage. It wouldn't be the first time. This client developed an obsession with scarring my face and wrote me notes that she wanted to pour boiling kettle water on me while I made her tea sometimes.  She expressed a desire to push me into the oven while I was cooking for her and also said she would grab the wheel while I was driving the company vehicle and make us crash off a bridge.   I no longer felt comfortable cooking foods like pasta or making her tea in the tiny apartment after we had a few close calls and she almost burned me with boiling water.  I brought this to the clinician who makes up her program and he told me I had to continue cooking there (there was an upstairs kitchen for other clients I proposed using) because if I cooked elsewhere it would destroy my clients sense of normalcy.&amp;#x200B;I began asking my client to sit in the very back of the van when I had to drive her places because I feared she would grab the wheel or attack me while I drove (she always sat in the passenger seat before she started up with these threats) and she retaliated by punching the mirror off my personal vehicle which was parked in the same driveway.  Again the company refused to compensate me for the damage to my car and seemed unconcerned by the danger I was in.  Eventually, my mental health got to a point where I was anxious constantly.  I transferred to a different place within the company, hoping that since it was a "Day Program" with a lot of clients and staff doing activities together I would have more support.  This was not the case.  Now, I was expected to take up to 5 clients in a van into the community, all of which had the tendency to run away and become violent in the van or at the outing location.  At the main office, one of the clients beat a staff member with a fire extinguisher and she suffered permanent damage because there wasn't enough staff to keep her safe or stop the attack once it started.&amp;#x200B;At this time, I started to realize I was going to get badly hurt or have someone hurt under my care, both of which would effectively end my career. Addressing my safety concerns  with management only led me to retaliation from my supervisors and being slightly ridiculed.  This entire time, I had a psychiatrist who was truly amazing and even better, his son worked at the same company as me and was experiencing similar issues.  I couldn't believe it, as we live in a capital city and the odds of that are just insane. My psych offered to put me on temporary disability due to my deteriorating mental state but I refused because I believe disability should be a last resort and I wasn't at that point.  During this year and  a half is when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I had some extremely dark times, for sure exacerbated by my work environment.  I had to be on a variety of medications to make it through the days and  I accepted this may be the case for the remainder of my life. One day, a coworker of mine was severely beaten with a rake and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance.  That day I sent in a brief email to my manager stating I was resigning, effective immediately, and would be happy to provide  a doctor's note if they had any questions.  They didn't.&amp;#x200B;After that, I did a few interviews while my boyfriend supported us (not ideal, but we made it).  Within two weeks, I was hired for two jobs in one day.   One was as a waitress for a restaurant and the other was as a health support worker for a health care company.  I waitressed until my job at the health care company began and then began doing that full-time.  That career had it's issues but it supported me for the next 8 months until I found my current job. I now work in an office and the change in my mental state is absolutely incredible.  The lack of stress, financial stability and routine schedule has changed my life.  I've been off all my psychiatric medications for a few months and I've never felt so clear headed.  I  felt so hopeless before.  I look forward to most days at work now.&amp;#x200B;Sorry for the novel, if anyone can relate to switching fields and positive effects on their well-being I'd love to hear.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: spelling/sentence structure [info] None [info] 1560606611
cloudarasoi [info] I’m Tired of Pain I don’t even know where to start. I’m so fucking tired of living. Last year was awful. My best friend and housemate died by suicide and I was home when it happened. Then my grandpa died. Then my emotional support animal was taken from me. Then last month, another friend of mine died but it was due to medical error. And then last week there was another death in the family. I’ve tried. I’ve tried so fucking hard to be normal my whole fucking life. I’ve been physically, emotionally, mentally, and sexually abused from a young age. I finally moved away from that house and found a friend group that was great. They loved me, accepted me, everything. Then I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychotic features, CPTSD, GAD, ADHD and panic disorder. That was seven years ago. I’ve been medicated since. My life has gone to shit. In early 2016, I became disabled due to physical and mental illnesses. I live in chronic pain now and doctors won’t give me anything for it because of the stupid opioid crisis. Pain patients are dying by suicide every single day and a blind eye is turned. I finally hit a low point last month and ran out of meds. My insurance changed and I haven’t really been back to the pharmacy to sort that all out because I’ve been too sick. Being off meds for nearly a month now has taught me that the medications helped but that they were numbing me on a deep level. I’ve been in and out of psych wards for years. I’ve tried therapy ever since I was diagnosed with mental illnesses. And I just want to fucking die, you know? I’m in constant physical and emotional pain and nothing helps. I’m really tired of being a drain on the people around me. I’m really tired of death and trauma at every turn and of therapists who don’t have any real answers for me. Life sucks and it’s been particularly rough with me. I just want a break. Or maybe a permanent solution. I don’t fucking know. I’m drowning. I’m fighting so much to stay alive right now but I don’t even know why I bother. Please, make it end. [info] None [info] 1580802251
edgar__allan__bro [info] Maybe a bad example, but I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder yet every group therapy session I've gone to and online support group I've been a part of... I can't relate to those who really seem to be heavily affected by their symptoms.At the least I think that there need to be more than a few classifications. Really though I think that these things need to stop being diagnosed as permanent conditions. In my case, I really only exhibit symptoms when under a ton of stress... And I feel like that just makes me a normal person. When you have the flu, it's common knowledge that you're temporarily ill. When you start flipping out because you're under immense levels of stress, you're labeled with a permanent disease and stigmatized by loved ones and medical professionals alike. I'm not fucking crazy. I just need to learn to cope with stress in more productive ways, just like some people with the flu might need more help recovering than others do because they don't cope well with physical illness.

slaughteredlamb1986 [info] Here in the UK I know people have been saying since long before I was a kid and still use it this way today. I had a manic day, or my job had been really manic. It's the correct usage of the word is the only use of the word I have ever heard before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now if people where going around saying I had a full manic episode at work today , then I would question what the fuck they are talking about. But if they said I've just been so manic today been so busy rushing here and there. I wouldn't question it and nobody I know with bipolar or not would question it because it's a common usage of the word and had been for a very long time. I think your holding on to that word as special to your situation for some reason when it's actually a word that been in common usage to mean something non clinical for a long time and is still used that way. No if they said I'm so bipolar I'm my moods are just so up and down and they weren't diagnosed. Or they started saying I've been so hypomanic today then I would take offense to it because it's never been in common usage . But this thread sounds like a lot of people who have only heard that word in a clinical sense and are getting offended when it's used in one of its more common ways that it's been used for at least a couple of centuries [info] None [info] 1514678242
hey-its-me-your-mom [info] I’m spending Christmas alone for the first time. I feel alone. I’ve basically alienated everyone around me.I have no friends, no family, no parents.A few weeks ago I was admitted into a hospital for planning my suicide. I had a hotel room booked for two days. I had a concrete plan. I was going to take my life on the first day.Anyways I’m better now. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd during my stay there and I’m getting treated for both now. My mom hated me for my ptsd diagnoses, she took it as a personal offense. I had to move out and into my grandpas as soon as I got out of the hospital.Everything started alright at my grandpas. My cousins who I grew up with lived across the street and my aunt was always happy to have me. The thing is I wasn’t the only one living at my grandpas. My cousins ex boyfriend lives here too and my cousin led me to believe that he was a shady kid who got onto a lot of trouble. I didn’t feel safe with him there and when I told my aunt about my concerns she brushed me off and all of my cousins turned on me.Well that was a few weeks ago. Yesterday everyone left to go on a family vacation in another state. My grandma, all of my aunts, most of my cousins, my grandpa, Everyone except for me.My cousins who didn’t go are going to hang out with their SOs. My dads wife despises me so I can’t go with him. Anytime I text my mom she uses it as an opportunity to mock my ptsd diagnoses. I have no family to celebrate Christmas with. No friends either.I’m going to be alone for Christmas. I don’t want to be alone for Christmasz. [info] None [info] 1577064339
lumpsthecat [info] Whatever is wrong with me, it is invisible. Hi folks. I just discovered this sub.I've been diagnosed with bipolar II for many years, which is an invisible illness in its own special way - but that's not what this post is about.For the last 4 months, I've been struggling with an unknown illness, consisting of low fevers and increasing weakness. My sed rate and CRP are high, indicating inflammation, but no one can figure out why. I've had pints of blood taken for analysis, rays shot into and shot out of me (CT and WBC scans, respectively) and nobody knows what's wrong. I'm on my second specialist (a rheumatologist, first was infectious disease) who is taking more blood and promising no answers. Upside: an echocardiogram is super cool. Thump-thump.I am increasingly unable to do normal things in my life. I haven't been working for most of the last 4 months. I can barely grocery shop for myself and take myself to appointments - by the time I get home I'm so exhausted I can barely move. I honestly feared I wouldn't make it from my car to my apartment today without sitting down for a while after going for a blood draw. I made it.I'm lucky in a way - I see a therapist weekly for my mental illness issues anyway, so I've had someone to lean on. It's great to have someone to say "I'm afraid I'm going to die" to that isn't my family. That would freak them out a bit.My boyfriend is incredibly supportive, but as any caregiver does, he has his limits. There are times he's been incredulous at how little I can do - a few times I've said I have to go lie down, and he says without thinking, "But you haven't done anything!" I've since explained how that makes me feel bad, and he's been more careful in his words, but of course it's dismaying that I can't even go for a short walk, never mind take the weekend vacation we were talking about.My family hasn't really understood how sick I am until recently. They're starting to see that I'm just not functioning. Of course, that makes them scared and upset... so I don't even know.I don't know if this is going to be chronic or if it is treatable or if it will go away on its own or if it's something really scary that will kill me. I'm scared and tired all the time. I just requested a temporary handicapped placard from my doctor, since just walking from the car to the store can wear me out. She said no problem, but I'm afraid the DMV will deny it, since I don't have a "visible handicap", which appears to be one of their criteria!My new rheumatologist wants to try putting me on prednisone -there's logic in that, but it scares me that it's just throwing drugs at a problem without having any idea what it is. I'm of course going to try it, despite *hating* prednisone, because what else can I do?I play a lot of videogames on my laptop on my couch. It is about the only thing making me happy right now.I feel like I'm doing fairly well coping with not knowing, despite my personal need for control in my life. I'm doing less well with the fatigue and exhaustion and inability to do anything without falling down on the couch, feverish and sweaty and panting. Not sure what I'm really looking for with this post - I don't even know what questions I would have. If you made it this far thanks for reading, and I honestly an desperately welcome any advice. Even if it's to meditate. Which my psych doc keeps telling me to do. :) [info] None [info] 1406679143

yellow_fleurs [info] Confused about/questioning diagnoses Not sure there's a point to this exactly, I know no one could give me medical advice or anything. I guess mostly interested in hearing other's experiences with this kind of thing. I am just trying to navigate the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (unspecified) after a reaction to Lexapro last year. That was a horrible couple of months and I was told I had a mixed episode. It continued after stopping although it improved. With a lot of lifestyle changes I am doing much better now. I also have symptoms of OCD.My current therapist agrees with the symptoms of OCD, but disagrees that I have shown any signs of bipolar disorder. I definitely have mood symptoms with seasons and hormones (also diagnosed with PMDD), but not sure about hypomania. I really like my therapist and overall trust her. In a sense it doesn't matter too much as long as I continue to do well and improve, but I wonder if I might be ignoring a problem that I should be medicating or at least looking out for. I will say that I tried Lamictal after that mixed episode and was less depressed, but extremely agitated and irritable. It was symptoms maybe from the Lexapro still, but it improved when I stopped the Lamictal. I kind of wonder if I just have problems with meds for some reason. Also my friends, including my friend with bipolar, all say they don't see bipolar either. So yea, I guess I am just curious about other's experiences with anything similar.

ATLgypsy [info] Edge of Seventeen's impact on me*SPOILERS* I just wanted to post my thoughts on this movie because it was very impactful and wanted to pick someone's brain on it too. I know I am late in seeing it, but I will say as someone who has struggled with mental illness, all beginning when I was 17 myself, it was very accurate to a point where it even triggered me. I was a little different than Nadine, I had a ton of friends, but I didn't understand my own actions/reactions and I was always unhappy on the inside. Everything in the world seemed so superficial and I had a lot of trouble actually relating to others even though I didn't have trouble making "friends".I related to her so much because my family is very "normal" and a little cold and viewed me as dramatic, abnormal, and problematic and I couldn't understand why I was so dramatic or difficult. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the spring of my junior year so I really related to when she says in the end the part of her watching herself outside of her body and not liking the things that she does or says but she can't control it. That was exactly what I would feel like when interacting with my family. As I went to college (I'm a senior now), I stopped caring so much what people think about me and, added to alcohol, would react in ways I didn't understand to more than my family. All because I was mad on the inside, but not at anyone, just at the entire world. I have been in Nadine's similar situations in thinking that a boy would fix things in my life or needing a boy to open up to so I would give them what they want just for the comfort of someone wanting me there and the chance they would listen. Her self-realization at the end, where she realizes that maybe she is the problem and that she can fix it is the same thing that turned things around for me. I know think that there is anything wrong with me, I know I have a mental illness, but I take it into my own hands and take responsibility for my own actions. I also take time to step outside myself and see what I am doing to other people and I really appreciate the people in my life that do actually care about me. I also really appreciated that she realizes that it is unfair to expect others to make her happy and that everyone else also has problems so it is selfish to think that yours are worse. I came to this realization myself. It was a great movie that people like me and Nadine really can relate to and I am so happy that young girls have a movie like this to watch.

Miss_Management [info] I've never been diagnosed with Aspergers butI was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 10.  It runs in my family both fortunately and unfortunately.   I don't have any children myself (yet anyways) but I've come to believe that the real secret is NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  Upon reaching my 30s I kinda feel like the end scene in the movie The Big Short about the collapse of the housing market.   These two young men were standing in an empty cubeville building looking around when asked what they were hoping to find replied something like 'I dunno,  adults. ' to paraphrase it.   That's how feel now.   We're all just kinda trying to figure out the "right" way to do things and people act like they know what they're doing and act like an authority figure but the truth is they don't really know what to do either.  I think as far as parenting goesI would say just be a good example and expect to fuck up.  A lot.   My parents did,  their parents did,  my friends with kids do,  etc.   It sounds like your life is stable enough and you're already raising two great kids so maybe consider going for it and take the plunge, so to speak.  Just do me a favor and don't treat your biological child differently then your daughters.   I had to deal with that growing up and it was a nightmare.   I wish you all the luck in the world and a happy New Year.  [info] None [info] 1546278403
novaVillian [info] Removing someone as representative payee with disability? (I posted this about an hour ago but I accidentally said "power of attorney" .. She's my representative payee.)Hello, I live in Texas and I have a situation and I need as much help as I can get.I have lived with my aunt since I was 12 years old. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the age of 14. At the age of 18 I was told to get on disability because I was at risk for my own life due to working, plus the risk of severe psychosis while on the job would not have been pleasant for anyone.Anyways.. if you do not know, bipolar people are known for impulsivity. I will admit that I have impulsivity, but more along the lines of being impulsive about what I say to people and then thinking "Oh, man.. I should not have done that." My impulsivity has not been in regards to money.. if anything I spend too much time freaking out over if spending $2 on something I need is okay or not.That being said.. my aunt used my bipolar disorder/impulsivity against me.My aunt has always been manipulative. I have been told by many professionals who have to deal with her that she "bullies people until she gets her way," which is very accurate. When I was applying for my disability and speaking with people, she was continuously bringing up that I'm way too impulsive to be handling my own money. Anytime I would try to sit and say that wasn't accurate, she would shush me and she wouldn't allow me to speak. She basically became my representative payee, meaning she has access to all of my funds.The thing is.. she abuses it. She always has, but the last time she abused it my medical condition was at high severity and due to her actions I could not get to the hospital I needed to go to. I could have called 911 but the mental facility they would have sent me to I have been there before and had to file physical abuse charges against them (which are still pending) so of course I REFUSE TO GO BACK. The hospital I wanted to go to, and have been to before and loved and got good care at, was a $30 uber drive (I cannot drive due to my disability/psychosis issue, but I was willing to shell out $30 for a damn good cause.) But.. my aunt had overdrawn my entire bank account 2 weeks prior. Why? To pay her and her children's phone bill. Because of her family's phone bill, I did not have access to proper medical care. I had to put the people I am living with through hell to try and get as stable as I could, and I am still not in a good place at all.Long story short.. with all of this.. how do I get her off of my power of attorney? There have been SO MANY other situations of her doing this to me but this was the final straw. I've done a little research that says I need to get an attorney.. I cannot afford that while I am making $600-$700 a month, I have to pay rent, and one doctor visit costs me $150-$200 alone. Not to mention medication.I'm sorry if I posted too much info but I wanted to be as detailed as possible as I really, really need help. I don't know what to do and I'm very concerned at this point. I have tried calling my social security office but the past two times I've called I haven't gotten very helpful people. Simply making phone calls right now is incredibly difficult due to how low my health is at right now. [info] None [info] 1515723241

daltonminor [info] I was on those two (alone with quetiapine), but only a small dose of abilify (5mg). This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar.It was a while ago, so I don't remember exactly how I felt. I was pretty depressed, but had no manic/hypomanic episodes. I ended up going off them cold turkey as I left them in the southern hemisphere by accident. There was a honeymoon period after that, but then I went "full bipolar", and started different meds. I'm back on abilify now, at a higher dose. The only side effect I've had with abilify is weight gain (in particular, it makes me hungry all the time).I hope this combo goes well for you!

britahto [info] How can I stop this? Please help There is honestly too much to explain. For nearly my whole life I have seen things, heard things, been physically touched, targeted, predicted deaths and felt a dark presence around me. I'm really fucking sick of whatever this is and I just want it to stop. I moved across the country and whatever this is stopped for a while. It started again recently... I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and sometimes it's hard to distinguish between what's in my head and what's real.... I have no one around me to be completely honest with and to ground me in an unbiased reality.Lately, it feels like whatever this is is amping up and has more power over my life than myself. Am I crazy? If I am then how have I share experiences with others? By complete coincidence?I need an unbiased friend right now who can help guide me through these days. Being isolated makes this so much worse and I'm tired of being afraid and drained every day...I just want to own my life again. I don't know where to turn. Please help if you can :(I want laughter back in my life. I want to come back into myself and what I value. I get afraid sometimes but for the most part I am just so damn exhausted and it feels like all that's left of me is just a husk of who I once was...Apparitions, lights, voices, rumbling coming from outside at night.

lady_stardust_ [info] Myself. I was in a string of bad relationships with people who brought out the worst in me. I’ve had very low self esteem my entire life despite excelling in school and being (I’m told, but still sort of don’t believe) witty and fairly good-looking. I also struggled with undiagnosed bipolar disorder for ten years. This translated into accepting awful treatment from people who claimed to love me. Sexual and verbal abuse, cheating, alcoholics, run-of-the-mill jerks with stagnant lives. Don’t get me wrong, I was a shitty partner too. I was often emotionally unstable, selfish, and had bad habits of my own, like smoking weed and cigarettes constantly, drinking too much, and eating mostly junk food. I was a broken person and I fell in love with other broken people.After ending my last relationship in the midst of my first full-blown manic episode, I finally had time to be on my own. Being single for the first time in almost a decade allowed me to step back and look at the patterns in my life for what they were. I was diagnosed with bipolar and started treatment but I couldn’t come to terms with it and was struggling to figure out what my life would look like in this new reality. I also still couldn’t shake my unhealthy habits and didn’t really want to. My current partner helped me accept my mental illness, quit smoking cigarettes, and deepen my interest in healthy activities like writing, cooking, and exercise. He helped me change my relationship with alcohol and weed, which I now use in moderation rather than to numb myself from reality. He also provides thoughtful, nonjudgmental alternative perspectives that help me to reframe life challenges and work through them rather than avoiding them or feeling helpless. My personality hasn’t changed fundamentally; it’s more like I’ve finally been able to let the best parts of myself come to the surface. I feel stronger with him. He’s helped me shed the things in my life that I always knew were weighing me down.Plus the sex is ridiculous. [info] None [info] 1528572063
gaifish [info] How do you accept that theres something wrong? Hi everyone! I hope this question doesnt get asked too frequently lol. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 like a year ago but its still so hard to admit that somethings wrong with me. I can acknowledge that i have highs and lows, but its so hard to wrap my head around the idea that this isnt just how everyone feels all the time. I feel like ive somehow tricked doctors into believing that theres something wrong with me. I guess just because like, for so long i managed to get by without help that its really hard to admit that there was a problem. And like, now that im on antipsychotics that actually work its hard to really believe that the psychosis and mania i experienced was real.  Also, its really hard to admit that i cant just overcome this by working harder and that i really might need meds and that this is like, a chronic problem that wont just go away one dayAnyone else feel this way?

L7weeniez [info] I never thought I’d fall in love, let alone, have to leave the one I cherish most. Any person will be quick to talk about their ex that was horrible to them, and eventually be happy to leave them. Nobody tells you about what it’s like to have to leave someone for your own good, and theirs- even though neither of you want it to end. Last year, I fell in love with the sweetest man I’ve ever laid my eyes on. he’s truly my best friend. Today I had to tell him I’m too unhealthy to be in a relationship. Recently, I was diagnosed with bipolar after self medicating to the point of going into psychosis. I’m in a depressive phase. Without medication, I’d be crying upward of 8 times a day. With medication, I feel subhuman. In the last two years I’ve failed out of two semesters of school after being date raped, and attempting suicide. I’m a Grade A disaster. I have to be happier and healthier before I can be in a stable relationship. Otherwise, I’m just going to keep hurting him and disappointing myself in the process. my heart hurts.

taytay9955 [info] Some people who have medicine resistant bipolar have better results from the keto diet ( which was designed to treat epilepsy) so maybe that is an option if you notice that it is responsive to changes in diet and exercise. I think if you check the boxes you check the boxes and it is just extra shitty that it doesn't respond to drugs, but if you have never had an EEG it might be worth having done. Sometimes epilepsy can seem like bipolar disorder. I have a really long story about this where I was diagnosed with bipolar, then diagnosed with epilepsy only to get a second and then a third opinion who told me I didn't have epilepsy. However, it could be worth looking into if you have any other warning signs.

sparklingdino [info] So how do you know/did you learn the difference between your normal mood and hypomania? I have been diagnosed with bipolar unspecified after a SSRI reaction, and am trying to figure out if I really get hypomania ever. Thing is I have had mood issues for like 15 years that cycle with the seasons and so there is fall/winter me and spring/summer me and yeah I feel way better during the spring/summer, but how can I know what my baseline even is at this point? Like I am way more productive and need less sleep, but couldn't that just be in comparison to my winter self? I do kind of think I have SAD. Plus I also have PMDD to further complicate things.So, did anyone else have issues with identifying hypomania, and how do you identify it now compared to a normal mood is my main question. Thank you!

wolfboy42 [info] It can be, but it's different for each person.  I was diagnosed with bipolar II, which was mild enough that the doctor put me on antidepressants to get through the lows along with guided mindfulness meditation sessions.  My manias only amount to me needing very little sleep, talking a mile a minute while jumping from topic to topic, and losing weight.  Sometimes I also become very irritable and get angry over what seems like little things in hindsight.  That's my least favorite symptom, but the mindfulness meditation helps manage it well.  I also think I get on my wife's nerves more during those times, but she is awesome and understands what's going on.Edit: added mindfulness treatment as I forgot it was something that was originally used but that I use on my own now.  Also added irritability as a symptom.Edit 2: As another user pointed out, Bipolar II doesn't experience true mania.  It's also not the symptom that I went to the doctor for.  At the end of the day, make sure you are open and honest with your doctor or therapist so that they can help you. [info] None [info] 1572322445

danaofdoom [info] That sucks man, I'm sorry. I think you should confront her directly. Tell her that it was really not any of her business (in fact, its almost never appropriate to discuss someone else's medical history without their permission), and very embarrassing, and that you're disappointed that your own mother would humiliate and degrade you like that. Do this calmly. If you can't do it calmly, then write her a note. I guess you could have her retract the story but I'm not sure it would do much good. At the very least she owes you an apology.As for similar experiences, well, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school (turned out to be a bullshit diagnoses, btw), my mother pretty much told her entire family and friends (I think it was some sort of "Oh look at how tough my life is! My daughter is bipolar!" thing). I had relatives that I hadn't spoken to in years coming out of the woodwork with unsolicited advice. Very humiliating for me. I eventually told her to knock it off, which lead to a huge fight, but she eventually did. [info] None [info] 1348012698

alaskagreen27 [info] For starters, the public system is bollocks. Secondly, 10 subsidised psychology sessions are not enough and still very expensive. Psychiatry and psychology go hand in hand.After the Medicare rebate, I pay $115 to see a psychiatrist. But I have to be able to pay $230 before being refunded. Lucky for me I only have to go every couple of months now. Then I pay $75 for a psychology session after the Medicare rebate. I can only get 10 subsidised session per year before the costs goes up to around $150 per session. Then I get to pay for medications. Joy. Luckily I usually only take one medication which isn’t that expensive. I also pay for health insurance - because if I ever need to go to a psychiatric hospital, only a private hospital would provide suitable care. There’s a 2 month waiting period, so it’s better to stay insured if you’re at risk. Public hospitals really only aim to keep people from hurting themselves, or to treat those who are severely ill - they don’t take on patients just to rehabilitate them. I used to be on the most expensive plan because only top hospital cover will insure for psychiatric care. But now you can have one lifetime upgrade without serving the waiting period, so I’ve switched to basic cover.On top of that, mediations can cause side effects which might require you to see another specialist. For me, I have just been referred to see a dermatologist because my medication causes next level acne. Yay, more $ for specialists. I couldn’t imagine having to pay for my medical expenses while unemployed and on government welfare. I’ve heard of people spending about 25% of their welfare payments just on medication alone. I also couldn’t imagine being treated in the public system - imagine the waiting list and frequency of appointments.Also, before you are diagnosed properly, some medications can be more expensive because you are not covered by the PBS scheme. For example, a few years ago, before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given an antipsychotic by a public hospital. This is a typical treatment for acute mania, but I wasn’t diagnosed yet and the hospital wouldn’t diagnose me after seeing me in emergency once. They only gave me about a week’s supply. I went to my GP for more, but she couldn’t diagnose me either so I had to pay $40 for a box of medication before being able to get into see a psychiatrist a month later. This is the type of medication which I only take in a time of crisis - and is generally only prescribed to bipolar and schizophrenic patients. You can only imagine the positions people are in when they need to take these kinds of drugs. I also see a GP who doesn’t bulk bill. I used to though. As someone with a lot of medical problems, I’ve realised that you often get what you pay for with GPs. Bulk billing GPs are usually ok strict time limits, or get booked out.

kissablyliterate [info] I recommend calling and speaking with your potential schools' mental health services department; most colleges have one. They can tell you about the services they offer, which usually include free therapy and granting accommodations. Accomodations could include things like a single room, or having a reserved seat at the very back of the room, and so on.I was diagnosed with bipolar during my fourth year. I absolutely failed every class my fall semester before I was diagnosed in December. I reached out to my program director and the campus mental health center. I was retroactively withdrawn from the entire fall semester, so it did not affect my GPA. I was able to maintain my status as a full time student while taking only three classes. My fifth year I lived in a single. I went to therapy at the MHC every week for a year and a half and never paid a dime. Without these accommodations and support, I absolutely would have flunked out. Having support from the college itself can be the key :) [info] None [info] 1522101643

Probably because when I'm alone, I tend to get depressed... And because I panic when in social situations and tend to talk a lot. [info] None [info] 1445909862
yankowitch [info] I don't have bipolar as part of my identity. As a woman, I identify most strongly with my identity in relation to others. I am a wife and mother. I am Canadian. I work with computers and I'm pretty smart. These are the things that are me, help draw a picture of what I'm like. I identify myself as disabled in diversity questionnaires but that's just so I can get accommodation and treatment,  a label only in relation to the medicolegal complex.Having bipolar is interesting but so was my accident and bursitis. Both give cognitive effects, the hip condition counterintuitively can affect the brain more due to the damaged proprioception and cognitive effects of pain. Although the experience of both "builds character" I choose to frame the experience just through the lens of suffering, recovery, chronic disease management,  etc. My feelings and behaviors are part of the experience, not part of my identity. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 10 years, it never made it into my identity. I guess I just look at identity politics differently. [info] None [info] 1420393344
nafrodite [info] Thank you for the kind words. I am already studying in Sydney, but I don't think my marks are anywhere near good enough to get me an entry level position given how many graduates there are compared to how many jobs are on offer. I had some issues halfway through my degree when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It sucked at the time, but I have it somewhat under control now.But I have to keep trying because what else can I do? I know that sounds a bit deflating, but I'm going to keep applying and hope something sticks. [info] None [info] 1424775346

robot_prez [info] I have a lot of intrusive thoughts when I'm in a depressed episode ad well. Not so much when hypomanic. I know the antidepressants I was on before I was diagnosed with bipolar made them really bad, my condolences.My therapist suggested writing down the intrusive thoughts on a piece of paper because the idea is that you'll give them tangible attention and will be able to ignore then sooner. Though, I always thought writing down "I keep picturing me bashing my head into the wall until my skull ruptures" a little awkward if someone was going to read over my shoulder.

sparkingthefire [info] I guess is feels like months. It's probably much shorter as I did start having issues when 1.55 came out. When I try to install my disc, first it wouldn't handle the updates. Now if I install it then go to run it it crashes. It's taken so long because it's frustrating and I'm also in college and work part time, plus I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and one of the medications made it known after a few tests that I have a very TINY brain tumor thing. So lot's of doctor's appointments. My discs won't do anything now, but now that I'm downloading them, base game will run, and it has downloaded every expansion with no previous issues. I'm just very excited, and sad that my discs are somehow no good anymore. I know I can get everything from the internet, but I like having physical copies and supporting the brand too :/ [info] None [info] 1379084328
narwhalactivist [info] I've had my moments. I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was 16. My advice is a little different and I find it more effective in reminding myself why I'm here. In all reality, we're going to die. Awesome, right? As an atheist, I believe once you're done, the lights go off. Poof. The best part? Our lives are so fucking insignificant that none of this matters. Hear me out, we're here right now. Life throws a lot of shitty things at you, but it also has a lot of great experiences to offer. So you know what? Suck all the life you can out of this world before you go out. This life, your suffering, even happiness, it's all temporary. Find something worth living for. *But narwhalactivist, that's so easy to say. Don't tell me this generic bullshit.* Seriously, it could be anything. Learning something you've always wanted to learn. Turns out it wasn't your thing? Fuck it! Find something else! I've tried learning an instrument, crocheting my favorite LoL characters, making Youtube videos, etc. And guess what? I sucked at all of it! But you know what, I was excited to learn and progress, and even though it didn't turn out to be my cup of tea, I'm still alive. Take it day by day. Help yourself out. Family sucks? Use that as motivation to put yourself in a position that gets you out of there. You have three people inside of you. Past LibrtyUniversity, Present LibrtyUniversity, and Future LibrtyUniversity. The game is to help each one out. Set Future up for success so that when the time comes, that Present you can be like "Hey, thanks Past LibrtyUniversity! Because of you, I'm happier than I would have been if you wouldn't have done xyz." Set yourself up for success. Not only do you deserve it, but you'll thank yourself and be so happy. I'm not going to make any comment on the girlfriend situation because I don't have enough details on the reasons why you're not digging her.Student loans? /r/personalfinance has you covered. Bull fucking shit you're alone. My inbox, as well as other users on here have an open one. Dude, prediagnosis (fuck, even after) I've done a lot of self-destructive things. You're not alone. I don't know who the hell you are, and you don't know me, but as a fellow homeosapien, I'd hate to lose one of my own to a state of mind that may just need a little nudge in the right direction to get over.I would also highly suggest looking into the basic principles of Buddhism. It helped me loads in dealing with "suffering" and how being mindful gives you a whole new outlook on life.Day by day, til' the thoughts go away&lt;3 It gets better, buddy.

paperplanesss [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, but i think that it’s incorrect and my impulsivity and elation from BPD is being misconstrued as mania, so I’m not really sure on the subject. Maybe it’s because I’m so new to trying to control it that I can’t see a “light at the end of the tunnel” so to speak 😣Would you mind elaborating on the stigma if possible? I’d only ever heard it briefly mentioned until now and would like to hear from someone who has worked through it.  [info] None [info] 1513139619
Winter-bells [info] Not that I know very much about it but there are certainly different paradigms that you can see your symptoms through. My friend has acute psychotic depressive episodes and prefers to see their experiences through a more shamanistic lens. Schizophrenia isn't at all shameful. My mother has schizoaffective disorder and I am diagnosed with bipolar 2, though I have hallucinations and delusions as well. I used to cry and feel a lot of shame, but now I just see it as the same as any 'disorder'. Some of my friends have fibromyalgia, some have diabetes, and I have bipolar.   That my brain sometimes glitches isn't at all shameful, it's just what happens sometimes. You're special for sure. You have a rich inner world, and the subjective experiences you had as a child are just as colourful as they ever were. Just because you now have the label of 'schizophrenia' doesn't invalidate your experiences a jot. Stigma is terrible -- but do you have one person who can understand? Who will listen?Your medicine is important to take, but can always be adjusted. Your colourful world isn't gone forever, you're just getting your dosages right to be able to function as best you can. You're still special, and your experiences are still valid, no matter what.  [info] None [info] 1485688205
thewhowithin69 [info] Burst my bubble?? Lmao. You really don't have a clue and should be cautious with your sterotyoing. I need kratom for pain (I don't care if a spinal tumor is a "legit" reason for needing pain control or not) because after too many years taking synthetic meds my body will not recognize them (genetic disorder) so you are assuming many things about me which is what frustrated me to begin with!! I know all about addiction and tolerance, first hand. And I know all about the damage that can occur thru injesting any product long term. I do not think that kratom isn't addicting but my point was it's not the plants that's the problem and I stand by that. If you struggle with addiction you can put anything in that spot (sex, food, etc) and still have this problem. Instead of focusing on this plant (or whatever your addicted to) it's internal personal work that needs to happen! So please don't think I'm just blindly prancing down the kratom to hell pathway because I know that isn't accurate. I am curious what you seem to think might be a good option for long term mood disorder?? And why do you have an opinion?? Because I was diagnosed with bipolar as a young person and have been treated with everything there is and so I actually come at this topic as a 50 yr old with some very strong opinions and experience!! Just saying that generalized statements are rarely helpful... [info] None [info] 1546532641

cheddarmoonbean [info] Going back to work... How to stay sane? I've been on a work leave for about 3 months now because my mental health really tanked. During that time I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have been taking lamotrigine for a few months. It's definitely been helpful, and it's been nice to have some time off to recuperate, but I go back next week and I'm kind of worried. Work has a tendency to send me spiralling down into depressive episodes, and I'll be working full-time for the first time ever... Does anyone have any experience with this? If so, how do you navigate/cope with working? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated! [info] None [info] 1582667583
Sporie [info] When I first was diagnosed, I thought of this. I have obsessive compulsive disorder. I was diagnosed with bipolar II......and when I told some of my friends, they'd say, "So you're bipolar?".. I thought "Does this illness define who I am more than having OCD?". They'd never said "So you're OCD?". I thought about the differences between the two. OCD feels more like a glitch in my mind, however I thought about my bipolar diagnosis. It feels as though it's coloured more of my perception of reality than OCD did. I'd prefer to say "I have bipolar disorder", though... but I'm really not sure why exactly.. It's definately a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'd take it back though, it's made me who I am. [info] hypomanic hugger [info] 1353474390
Kyle7979 [info] That's what I thought too, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 years ago. Not being on medicine and being manic could definitely make someone act like this.

I just wonder how many promotions are going to be willing to take a chance on him after yet another set back. [info] None [info] 1568532419

I have two bachelors degrees, working on my Masters, married, two kids and lead a successful life.  It's taken about 8 or 9 total appointments and new meds or adjustments to get it right.

termedea [info] That's a tough journey! I'm proud of you for getting this far.I didn't know about mental health awareness month. It's a great thing that I'll spread here too. It isn't a thing here where I live, but it should be. Now, considering your post, I've stopped to reflect on my own progress. I've been on sick leave for about 3,5 years for what started out as a burn out and later unraveled a plethora of issues and diagnoses for me. I've been depressed for most of my life, without knowing I could get help, I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2, and now I'm awaiting an assessment to see if I'm suffering from a neurodevelopmental disorder.  It's been a tough couple of years, but I've finally started to move forward - and I've gotten far.  I've got a much better understanding of myself now, my strengths and limitations. I can work part time again and even push myself, because I know how to recharge and balance myself after challenges. I've got a better understanding of what I need from others. And probably most importantly of all, I'm more calm toward my bad episodes, and I rarely go into a depressive spiral where I fear nothing could get better again when they happen. Best of luck to you and happy Mental Health Awareness Month. Thanks for bringing this to my attention! :) [info] bp2 [info] 1556802702
lordvoltano [info] I went a long time without being diagnosed. I suspect my behaviour was due to my hypomania. I owe a lot of my betterment from my previous medications when I was diagnosed with bipolar.

ElfinShirring [info] I’m so tired. So emotionally and physically and mentally tired. Just like the title says. I’m tired. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a young age and I really think it was a misdiagnosis. I work a shit job because I can’t hold down a decent paying job. I never have the motivation to clean my home. So it’s dirty a lot, which bums me out even more. Which makes it harder to clean. My relationship with my father is fucking bullshit. All over some money. Whatever. I have one friend who gets what I’m going through. I have one other who doesn’t understand but tries. My S/O has a lot of mental health issues which I empathize with but sometimes it feels like her needs ALWAYS come first.    I honestly don’t have any clue where I was going with this post.

nicrose8 [info] Great day, horrible day, same day. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in March and it has been a mega roller coaster. And now it feels like things are leveling out, I was having a great day. I've done things in manic and depressed states that I regret and have been trying to atone for them but some bridges just can't be mended. I was having a great day, made big headway on my disability application, went to the dog park with my service dog in training. The sun was shining in every way. Anyway, after a confusing situation, I get an email from a supposed friend telling me that I am narcissistic and selfish and more. So I do what I've had to do a lot post manic state, I apologize profusely. Too bad, email back is all negative. So again, I apologize profusely but use fewer words for her to turn around on me. I just wish I had friends. Friends that I have been shitty to in a state of insanity but that can be understanding. It's certainly taught me to be more empathetic but I need some friends. I'm tired. I need just one day that's just good. [info] None [info] 1375844391
holdtheearthinplace [info] So, first time posting here, I don't know what to expect or why I'm doing this (so much text). I just felt really shit, like to the point where I don't know what to do. I'm not going to do anything, I think I just lack the ability to muster up the enthusiasm.I'm 22, and I've been diagnosed with bipolar, but I'm depressed 99.98% of the time so here makes more sense, hope that's okay. I have a psychology degree (how ironic) that I'm never going to use. I'm back at uni to study english to hopefully do teaching later, I just have no energy. I thought I wanted to be engaged in something meaningful but I guess I don't. I kinda just make it through each school day, then I go to my job, I work with kids. It's stressful because it's casual. I'm just complaining now.I just want someone to talk to about it. I can't tell anyone. I stopped taking my meds (it was an accident) and then I couldn't get an appointment but I wasn't feeling so great before that anyway.  It's the first question out of everyones mouths. 'Did you stop taking your meds?' Yes. Oh just take them and you'll be fine again. Plus I think I've worn out the one person that cares about that kinda thing. I just don't know.Hi, I suck.I just want someone to care even though I know I don't deserve it. I'm short tempered and all around not interesting when I'm depressed. Urgh. I'm sorry.

DailyDayDreamer [info] What is it like? (Long Self Discovery &amp; Realization Post) I am 20 years old, and bipolar type 1 according to the many psychiatrists I have seen, and my therapist said with my history I have the history of someone with bipolar. If these people are correct which I doubt all the time; I mean I was using drugs at the time, but when I quit using drugs I went in to the hospital a few months later for some very bizarre behavior, and suicidal ideation. Again I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I mean the only time I get crazy crazy manic is when I put a little bit of a stimulant in my system like when I take Adderall it triggers this thing in my that engulfs my entire life with motivation and creative force even when I only take like 1 or 2 its like the effects don't wear off for months. I do not know honestly why I am diagnosed bipolar... My father was diagnosed bipolar 1, so maybe I got it as well. I have tried to kill myself more times than I have fingers on one of my hands. Also I did spend my entire trust fund on drugs, crazy investments, and misc. items $60,000 worth to be exact. Also I am not sure if at times I am an ego maniac, or a maniac... Doesn't everyone think they are the next president? The next famous musician? The savior of the earth? The brilliant mind who is capable of anything, and everything... I have been stable for about 8 months now on the best medication regime I have been on; 20 mg of Latuda, and 200 mg of Lamotrogine. I have enrolled, and not dropped out of college, and have been maintaining my job for about 6 months( longest ever), and I recently got a girlfriend. Through the hours of intense therapy, medications, and AA; I guess I have the chance at a normal life and normal relationships. I do not know really, but what I am asking is what is it like having Bipolar disorder? Rereading this post, I can clearly see the behavior, but I guess I am still in denial about everything. I just want to know if their is anyone else like this here. What is like being bipolar? Is it like anything that I have experienced? Am I any different?I have recently found this forum, and I think it could be a valuable resource for me. Thanks! [info] Bipolar I [info] 1414443304

IzThisMyLife [info] Ok this is a long one...... ready?TLDR at bottom. Hello I just want to say I'm so sorry you are going through this. I cannot imagine what it is like. Just remember you are doing the best you can and you're doing it for her father. It takes a strong woman to stick with someone after all of that most women would not be able to handle so many years with these issues from his daughter. I for one would be furious but I know what it's like for someone to leave because you have a problem child. So if nobody has told you or if he has not yet thanked you for the sacrifice and the effort that you are making I just want to say that I've noticed it and you should be proud of yourself for even trying. Reading this makes my step daughters look like angels. Even though they are truly good girls they are 18 years old and 21 so it's only a matter of time before they start being a little reckless. But this is okay with me and I especially don't want their father to think that I don't want them around.You guys are good parents and you're doing what you can. I also grew up with good parents although my father died when I was 14 my mother did her very best and I can truly say that she raised us very well. However that didn't stop my older sister from being a stripper and it didn't stop me from leaving the house at 15 because I wanted to party all night with my friends and take pills. I'm sure this is not what you want to hear and maybe I'll be singing a different tune when my little girls become teenagers. My youngest is 7 and my oldest is 9. My 9 year old is a hell-raiser she's been since she was a toddler and she is exactly like me and I am expecting the worse. I love my mother and I got arrested I used drugs I tried to kill myself the whole 9. She did what she could I've been in the psych ward like 11 times. But nothing seemed to help. I think when a girl gets a certain age she wants to have sex with boys and party and experiment with drugs as I did. There was no reason for me to do such a thing although I was diagnosed with bipolar Mania. I can say even after I got clean which was many years later I was still sort of crazy. Definitely emotionally unstable. I saw a psychiatrist and I tried medication and sometimes that's necessary. However I decided that I did not want to be a slave to another drug just because it was acceptable in the eyes of society. But that is my experience. What I'm just trying to tell you is that sometimes no matter what efforts you make or how hard you try you need to understand that it's not a mistake that you made especially since she's only been living with you since she's 9. I know this is tough for you guys but I think for your own sanity you guys need to let her be and I promise you she will come to her senses you just need to be there for her when she truly needs you. But at her age she's an Unstoppable Force. At least that is what I was and that is what I believe because I truly felt that nothing could stop me. No matter who I hurt. I was young and stupid.The issues with her lying though concern me also the incidents with the bloody sheets and pads in her room those are definitely signs that something is wrong. I suspect she has some type of mental illness.  but I'm not a doctor so I shouldn't comment. I think if you're truly desperate your last resort should try a psychiatrist which I think you may have reached that point. But if not, you need to just let her be she will go out and party and then she will struggle to find a place to live she will be hungry and only then will she appreciate all that you guys have given her. And then she will probably come back and try to be the good girl that you have been trying to raise her to be however there's going to be many f*** ups more lies and definitely stealing if she doesn't have a job and she's broke and hungry and living couch to couch. I know it sucks to worry and wonder where your child is but you have to remember she's not a child anymore and sometimes you have to let them learn the hard way which is the only way that I learned it sucks and I went through a lot and I feel sometimes that I could have been killed from being on my own at such a young age but what's important is that I learned from it and I'm an amazing daughter and I help my mother with everything that I can and it surely never thought that I would be the person that I am today I would even call myself emotionally stable and everything. But it took a long road I'm 33 years old and I can finally say that my mom is probably no longer worrying about me or what I'm doing. Now it's my turn to worry about her. Her time will come unfortunately nobody knows when. This may be bad advice but in my opinion you have two other girls that you have to raise and you and your husband cannot be at your wit's end because it's going to affect the lives of your other girls. Talk to your husband and either do the psychiatrist or stop pushing a girl who doesn't want to be pushed and will eventually push back and even ruin your lives possibly. Like I said be there for her when she truly needs you she will reach out to you when she's in trouble I promise you that. But until then it's going to be tough but you have to let her go.TLDR: the girls going to do whatever she wants anyways no matter if she's 15 or 19. She's got recklessness on her agenda and nobody's going to stop her. Let her go now and let her learn her lesson the hard way in order to save your sanity. [info] None [info] 1522714262
BeautifulGhost [info] From what I've learned with my doctor and research over the years it's a lot to do with medication and our unstable lifestyles when we stray from routine. Most of the medications cause weight gain and during episodes it's easy to stray from a healthy diet to over eating or not eating at all. I've had bipolar since my childhood but it wasnt treated until 7 years ago. I'm a rapid cycler so the ups and downs can sometimes change in as little as minutes. When this happens I CRAVE sweets. I can't control it and I'll cut anyone down who gets between me and the vending machine at work lol! My psychiatrist believes it's due to the instant release of dopamine that sugar gives us. Like a quick fix and a way for me to try and stop my sudden shifts. My metabolism is fast, my weight stays around 125lbs and I'm 5'6. My concern is all the sugar intake will cause me to have diabetes, it's a misconception that people who are overweight are the only ones who get diabetes.  Bipolar and diabetes are so toxic together because just like our mood shifts with bipolar our sugar also shifts constantly with diabetes. 3 years ago I went to a hospital because I was in a lot of pain and had a serious flu like cold.  I was also dizzy and my equilibrium was off. Once the doctor returned to the room she asked me how long ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She then went on to say that "sometimes, when those who suffer from this disorder have episodes, they often make things up in their heads that seem real but aren't." She gave me a xanax and released me with a pamphlet stating I had been treated for psychosis. My sister was with me and she about lost her shit in the room when the doctor said that to me. 3 days later I couldn't breathe and my mom rushed me to urgent care. I fainted when they took my blood pressure and was rushed to another hospital where I was admitted for a pneumonia, kidney infection and an unknown virus. They couldn't stabilize me and my doctor spent over 3 hours at my bedside trying to figure out how to treat the virus they had never seen before. It was so bad he started preparing my parents for worst case scenario and had a priest visit. I pulled out of it and was discharged 3 weeks later. Moral is a lot of doctors and providers write us off as being psychotic before actually treating the symptoms. I still remember hearing the nurse outside my room say "just a heads up this ones bipolar" and giggle to another coworker. When doctors dont give proper health care that can cause early death as well. [info] None [info] 1569165572
hallucinatingemu [info] I am having trouble thinking before I act. It seems like all I do is make bad decisions. I was diagnosed with bipolar a few yeara ago. It explains a lot of my decisions/actions in the past. I was self medicating with pot/pills/coke/alcohol but quit. Now I just smoke pot but because of a recent car accident that was entirely my fault, I have decided to give it up. I wasn't high while driving but I've decided I need to clear my head. I started taking lithium a month and a half ago and it has helped a lot. The problem is I feel stupid and I feel that no matter what I do I will always screw up. I am where I am in life because I keep making the wrong choices and it's hurting my marraige. My husband is afraid that I'm going to keep screwing up. My daughter (different dad than my husband) lives with my parents until I'm mentally and financially stable. I was on the path to success until i wrecked our only car. I just don't know what to do to change my way of thinking so I stop messing up. [info] None [info] 1532031160

This is family I see on a semi-regular basis, I was OBVIOUSLY not going to ignore the huge scar across my neck, but come on?! Was it that hard to allow ME to break the news about my situation? I don't think so. So far I've been going to other doctors (cardiologists, radiologists) and she's asked how it went (despite the fact that I'm not talking to her), and I'm giving her the tl;dr of everything: "fine", "I might look for another doctor", "I'm on meds now", etc. I think it's funny though how some things are worthy of telling, but others are worthy of shame. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a year ago. NO ONE in my same extended family knows. Maybe because it's mental illness isn't cool or glamorizing and tragic as cancer can be and wouldn't bring her much sympathy. Never worth mentioning. [info] None [info] 1533074048
destroying_maps [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and complex PTSD, and I don't take meds for it. I do, however, go to therapy every week, and have to arrange my life carefully to allow for management of my symptoms. When I started T, we had to be careful about making sure my levels stayed stable as my body adjusted. This meant, in my case, breaking up my weekly dose of T into two shots per week. Did it suck sometimes having to stick myself every few days? Kinda. I also experimented with daily micro-doses, and that sucked too (and was thankfully unnecessary because it didn't differ much from the twice a week for me). But being on T has improved my ability to cope with symptoms and has removed an added level of stress that often triggered episodes, so being careful was worth it. [info] T - 10/'14. top - 07/'15.

caraconcerta [info] Why not both? WLS is a tool to help us realize our limitations, therapy is a tool used to help realize our mental limitations and overcome them. They can peacefully coincide and work with one another, no? They certainly have for me thus far. I am diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder, had binge eating issues and the first two months have been nothing less than unendingly agonizing. But that being said, it was the care I got through bariatrics, my psychiatrist, and my therapist that made the difference. I mean, that's what hospitals strive for right? Coordinated care? That's why nutritionists work with bariatrics, and most programs have us go to support groups. I'm sorry therapy did not work for you. That is unfortunate.

cmdr_felux [info] Sort of. They put me on a medication when I was diagnosed with bipolar that had a very convenient side effect of getting t-boned by a freight train shortly after digestion. I went from sleeping 3-4 hours to sleeping 9-10 hours. My body built a tolerance to it after being on it for 9 years and it stopped being effective as a mood stabilizer and sleep aid so it was back to square one. Traditional sleep meds haven't been effective since then so I've been sleep deprived these last 2 years as I tried all these other drugs. I'm waiting to get into a CBT-I program now to see if that'll help! I hear good things about it. [info] None [info] 1547561991
kykapoo [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar, a misdiagnosis, but during an internship I needed to take some days off so it was suggested I speak with HR. I didn't know what I had to say so I told them. I didn't get a job offer, everything pointed to me getting one, and after the intern head was let go she told me it was because everyone found out I was bipolar. That was five years ago. I have never had an actual job. No one within my field would hire me... And in interviews they'd mention they knew the previous place's CEO. Fun. [info] None [info] 1538882627
mayidescend [info] I got diagnosed with BPD as soon as I turned 18, the psychiatrist i saw refused to diagnose BPD or any other major disorder until official adulthood- so I got diagnosed with basically everything else instead until then (it was annoying).At age 19 I started going to a different psychiatrist and decided not to inform her of past diagnosis to see if what I was diagnosed with truly was right. I even saw a therapist who I practiced the same thing with.I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, with small mania symptoms (the grading scale each of them used had mania with bpd 1).I learned how to manage my symptoms through therapy and eventually, at 20, was taken off medication (which I’ve been on different medications since age 11), and later in the year was released from therapy after being in it on and off since age 6/7. I wasn’t fully better, but I had the necessary skills to become better than I was in the past.Im nearly 22 now.I go to the same Psychiatrist every 3 months now. Just to make sure I’m managing myself alright: and She says I’m showing more mania signs off the medication, but all together, all my symptoms have gone down drastically to the point of me being considered “healed” if I maintain it for two more years.I still have bad spells, but I also have pretty good days as well. When I notice myself getting low, i practice what I’ve learned.

123BuckleMyFuck [info] Sometimes I have no idea how some doctors are allowed to practice. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I was let out of the hospital I was assigned to an outpatient psychiatrist. This man believed that all my problems stemmed from me not being respected by people and that my psyche was damaged because I wasn't the head of a household. He then proceeded to tell me that mental disorders are created by the brain and there is no such thing as a legitimate mental disorder. This man was a medical doctor. [info] None [info] 1470291700
devilwriter [info] Can't take it anymore and I really could use some advice.  I'll keep this short. I'm 26f and just graduated with my masters degree. I have a wonderful job and support system. I am clinically depressed. I've been adjusting and readjusting medications since I was 14. I've been in therapy for years but it never goes anywhere. I've dine research in my own and have decided that cognitive behavioral is beat for me but it always lacks. It goes in flows and in fact I was diagnosed with bipolar II two years ago. Everything is great in my life except I have no interests except work and school. I can't afford to spend more time going to school and I'm afraid additional work will be unhealthy. I have heard the mantras about finding a hobby, working out etc. I get it and agree but frankly have no energy to do much. I know I am in remission because I'd rather be asleep than awake. I am NOT suicidal I just like sleep more than activity if that makes sense. I'm not looking for sympathy but instead solid advice. There are a few more details I guess (we humans are so complex) but I think I gave enough--if not I'd be happy to clarify. Any and all feedback would be helpful at this point as my quality of life has dropped dramatically the last week or so. Thanks Reddit. You have at least kept me company.

manku_timma [info] See. I think it is rather insensitive to think of it as something "edgy". It's trivializing the issue. There *are* people out there who don't give a fuck. Why does one fear death? Because they are comfortable with life and don't want to lose it. Now think of a person who hates even waking up in the morning. He hates life and has nothing to lose. Why would he fear death?I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I am suicidal, and tend to punish myself by self harm, and I am aware this is because I am mentally ill.The fact still stands that, people who have nothing to live for and have nothing to lose, don't really give a fuck about death. Yes they might be mentally ill and need help, but they still exist. I mean I will raise my hand and volunteer myself for the hydraulic press channel lol. I know how it would be. Head slowly gets crushed. As the pain builds, you have instant regret. Panic builds and you want it to stop, but it's too late "I want to live! Wtf did I do!". Then you cry about doing this to your parents. And then crunch, your head's a patty. I am aware of death. The only thing I fear about death, is the affect it will have on my family.

Motion_ambient [info] Hating someone so much that I want to hurt myself. Hello. I realize this is an odd thought pattern/behavior, but I find myself struggling with it and was wondering if I was the only one. I was diagnosed with bipolar II last year. I have an ex friend who defended my abusive ex (that she knew I was sensitive about) which triggered PTSD flashbacks, which caused me to lash out. She then said that I was just looking for attention and that I was crazy. One day she consistently sent me text messages, taunting me. She continued doing this even when I told her to stop and that she was overwhelming me. I eventually had to block her. Basically, whenever I think about her and what she said to hurt me, I get so angry that I have the desire to inflict pain onto myself. Usually I scratch my arm as hard as I can, and I will sometimes make myself bleed. I’m not sure why this happens, but the anger and hatred for her that I feel inside are so overwhelming that I can’t seem to control it. Has anyone else dealt with similar thought patterns? Does anyone have any recommendations on what I can do to stop? [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1541572728
HeisenbergSpecial [info] One of the more valid reasons that I've heard from people who don't want to try drugs is that they don't want to lose control of their mental faculties.  Ironically, that's precisely the reason I started using drugs in the first place.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for the last ten years, and drugs can allow me to have a lot more control over my moods and my state of mind than I'd be able to without them.

blackjustin [info] Feeling a bit lost. I'd like to share. I feel like I’m actually going crazy.    If it’s okay, I’d like to share and ask a couple of questions. I’m not looking to be diagnosed– I believe I may have aspergers and have an appointment set up, but my therapist is one of those “that isn’t what’s wrong with you!” type of people. I’d like to hear from others and maybe see if our experiences match up and get some evidence to present when we meet.    I’m a 34 year old male. At 15 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Recently I was diagnosed with having ADHD, a memory/spatial problem, and a specific learning disorder (math). I think I may have been wrongly diagnosed. I’ve always had a bit of a social problem. Basically, I’ve always felt disconnected, or maybe alienated from other people. I don’t understand why people do the things that they do, and it’s been my lifelong mission to understand human behavior – which I still fail at. As I got older, this has only gotten worse. Sometimes when I speak, I feel like I speak in the most plain English possible, and I’m still not understood. Sometimes when I express intellectual ideas, it’s like me and the other person are talking about the same topic, but we aren’t talking about the same thing, if that makes sense?I was recently in a relationship that ended. I got broken up with. She said she felt an emotional disconnect, which really took me by surprise. I felt like I was doing everything right, but she said there were a few nights where she really felt like she needed emotional support, and I didn’t provide it. I missed this entirely. I don’t exactly operate like that; when a loved one has a problem, I fixate on trying to resolve the issue. Sometimes I feel like I understand feelings based only on an interpretation of that feeling. What I mean is – I think I may understand emotions based on what they look like, but not because I’ve ever truly felt them normally. A type of mimicry.  I’ve long realized I don’t experience emotions the way others do, and every time I meet someone I like, which is rare, that thought is only reinforced. It’s easy to say it’s others initially, but this has happened more than once. Pretty sure it’s a “me” thing at this point.       Other things I’ve noticed…I can only thrive with an incredibly rigid schedule. I’m at my best when my day is planned, almost down to the minute. Intense obsessions: I get obsessions with things until I know everything about them. This has included African Lions, snakes, MMA (spent seven years there), psychology and philosophy (which are both my majors). My current obsession is Nietzsche. I’ve been reading him for years, over and over. This also happens with TV shows – I have three TV shows that I watch over and over. Otherwise, not interested. Also, writing. It isn’t unusual for me to sit down and write a several thousand word essay in one sitting. If I don’t write, I get a panic attack. Sometimes I’ll even scrawl on the walls if there’s no alternative. Extreme social isolation without feeling lonely.Need for sameness: If something slight is different, it really, really throws me off. Last week someone switched seats in a classroom, and it really fucked me up. This type of thing has happened many times over my life. Overstimulation: I sometimes go to public events. When there is loud music, screaming children, painted faces = overstimulated, which usually expresses itself in hostility and the feeling of being trapped.  I also get overstimulated physically during intimacy with another person. Repeated movements: This used to be pacing for hours on end. But since I started taking Adderall, I’ve (mostly) stopped pacing and now I rub my fingers together almost non-stop. I’ve literally rubbed callouses onto most of my fingers. Is this what it’s like? I've never had anyone directly mention anything to me - but I also haven't known many people that deeply. I do have one or two professors who have noticed something is up - they occasionally send me random emails that more or less ask how I am - but otherwise, it's never been brought up.

PM_me_punanis [info] This is basically me except I have no affinity to certain noises, textures and smells. I thought I was just an angsty teenager. Or it was just a phase. Or just stress from school. At age 27, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought I was just depressed from the stress of medical school. But no. I graduated, moved to another country for a fresh start, got married, now a housewife that supposedly should have zero stress... And I still feel the highs and lows. I get anxious and can feel my heart rate going up in social situations. It is crazy and it's been getting worse. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have wasted the best years of my life in nursing school and medical school, aggravating my symptoms even further with so much physical and emotional stress. (We had 36 hour shifts for 2 yrs, no holidays, exams all the time, plus the fact that I see so much suffering every day, with the very real feeling that you have zero capacity to help someone because you aren't god.) Working in that field would kill me. Also, if I had known how much the medications would ruin my brain, I probably wouldn't have taken them. Yes, I stopped trying to kill myself after the 3rd time with the help of meds, but my entire life, I was the "smart one" and now my memory is shit.What am I if I wasn't the smart one? It's been a struggle but I shifted my focus on being the best wife. If my purpose in life is to support my husband, then that is what I am doing. I will always do my best in whatever I do, within the bounds of reason and within my limited capacity. I still feel so useless, from being so productive, I just spend my days doing housewife things.. But I'm proud to say I have made a bit of progress. [info] None [info] 1534593428
refrigerators101 [info] I really enjoyed this story. Growing up with my dad having bipolar and addiction, I can relate to a lot of what was told in this story. Since I have been diagnosed with bipolar three years ago, this has been my constant fear; the fear of having the good mommy/bad mommy swings. There will always be a high risk for me to get worse, to pass it on to my kids, to break up relationships...but why should I fear the unknown when I can learn to better myself day by day?

KnittedOwl [info] I'm a little younger than you but I've been dealing with mental illness since I was 9. My parents threw me into the psych department of my hospital for "anger issues" that no one could see. I was just a moody kid that didn't like talking to people. I never stopped seeing a therapist and psych. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder the day I turned 18. Now with a back story where parents seem to think something is wrong, you would think they are supportive of me having a diagnosis but having bipolar might as well have been a death sentence to them. They don't allow me to drink, though I'm 21. They don't allow me to be moody. I've learned to "fake it until I make it" until I reach my room where I lock my door and get to be however I want to be. I've given them the bipolar disorder survival guide book to read. I've had my psych write explanations to them on what I have.I think the biggest thing is that when they grew up, being bipolar was a bigger deal then it is now. People could be put in psych wards for a very long time just for the diagnosis. I have an aunt who was very helpful in explaining it to me. She said "If you had cancer you would get treatment for that right? Your head is just a little sick and it's something people don't understand and will want to say you don't have, just like cancer because it's scary, but that doesn't mean you don't have it. You just keep treating it, going to the doctors and doing what is best for you"In the long run I started ignoring most of what my parent's said that was discouraging including the most recent "you should come off your meds so you can be skinny again" and I'm doing really well.

Hollyxmas [info] (SPOILER)Looking for some kind of help? Excuse my spelling and grammar.  I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was about 13 and put on multiple medications(I don't remember witch) I'm now 21and have been off pills for 7 years and don't really want "help" from pills. I've always been moody and extremely  irritable at times but for the past few months now its been getting a lot stronger. Its making everyone around me miserable including myself. I'm not suicidal but i REALLY need to change for me and everyone around me . I defiantly self medicate and its taking it's course and making it worse. This is really hitting me hard right now becuase I just realized I'm not the only miserable person. I guess im just looking for feed back or some sort of help. Like I said I'm not suicidal. Life is heaven but I'm struggling. If someone has a similar story or advise on how you over came your hole that'd be cool. [info] None [info] 1459715371
Camden_Chaos [info] Thank you for your time. I agree, and I would add that schizophrenia is not well-understood, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder following a psychotic episode a couple years ago. It's a terrifying concept at first to one who fears the loss of his ordered thought structure and routine. Drug use primed me for a shift in consciousness, which of course is like another 'eye' in the body that adds a dimension to the information processed. It gives you another view of reality, and more information can be obtained through the process of experiencing them (with different filters that show a bigger piece of the whole).    Semantic understanding of these relationships can be reduced to a universal whole, but the problem has been communication this from person to person. Entropy represents the loss in translation through a medium. Symbols repeat themselves in patterns that can be recognized time and time again, but in an attempt to communicate this same truth in an infinite number of languages, accents, and so forth, it's easy to get confused. Imprinted symbol systems lead to an interpretation of nonsense from someone else.    What is schizophrenia? Why do we see people developing it over and over? Mental health is not well understood, and that is due to all of the social symbol imprinting out there. Try to describe something as "big" and the choices and ways that can be expressed over the whole of humanity is crazy. It is thus a goal to reduce "big" to a direction relative to an observer. The more elements you define, the more confusing everything becomes and the more misunderstandings we have with other people. More people are suffering as the world becomes more technologically charged, and ideas can move more quickly. A life out of balance that will generate negative feedback until we return to a simpler paradigm.    This relationship exists in art and the communication of symbols without discriminatory filters that we might find in other areas of judgment. I have written in my spare time throughout my life, and my creative endeavors spontaneously arrived at a meta-concept. Sure, at first, it appears to be disorganized thinking that is drawing lines between dots that aren't even there. But I kept returning to it, changing it, seeing how it was reflecting issues of my life, elements of fantasy culture and mythology that sparked my childhood imagination, and adding new concepts. I integrated more things, and it seems apparent in the moment that everything is connected. So the natural pursuit at first is to create a beautiful story and share my thoughts, and once I discovered this, the next natural progression is realizing that the physical body is only one component of a continuous infinite experience leads me to not fear death (nor to actively pursue it) but to spend the rest of my time and energy trying to communicate this revelation so that we are not afraid and can align our goals toward increasing future awareness and enjoying the remainder of life unified by this truth.    Perhaps this schizophrenic pattern we see that continues to manifest itself in individuals for an unknown reason is an evolutionary attempt to make sense of this, or of an active process of awakening. It keeps happening until a perfect form is achieved, getting closer at each step. Not sharing this information out of fear of judgement or prosecution is ridiculous. I will acknowledge that in previous "cycles" of my attempts to make this realization, the momentum to proceed has always been in integrating the previous works into a meaningful whole.

MarnietheDoug [info] &gt; Another thing I want to add is that sometimes they may or may not say some pretty mean things to you, but just remember it's not her fault and she doesn't mean it.Thanks for saying that. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was having periods of extreme delusions and that all my friends hated me. My SO couldn't understand because he got nothing but love from them and why I wasn't registering the same way. I would say mean things about them to my SO but he knew that I didn't mean it. I mean, I felt deep down that there was some sort of conflict in what I was saying and what was going on in reality but I couldn't sort the difference between the two. Which one was true and which one was false. I'm just glad I never said anything to them because they are really good friends. I had a really bad manic breakdown last week where I was paralyzed at work I was freaking out so bad. I told my good friend about it the next day, we work on the same floor together, and she told me to contact her the next time that happens so she can come over and take care of me. I was like, I hardly wanted my SO to know that I was in that state let alone her. She let me know that was for her to decide and that she loved me. What an angel. I don't know what I did that she let me into her life. Just a sweetie.   [info] None [info] 1468851278
blackeyes1 [info] bad breath I remember smelling bad breath from somewhere it was just in the air but it was really starting to bother me. I even checked my own breath and I knew it wasn't me it was something else and it one of life's most annoying things to smell bad breath and embarrassing to have it. Talking to people or people talking to you with bad breath can be a very awkward situation. I could keep on smelling it though and I tried using air freshener and I even started to have mints and use more mouth wash on myself, just in case if it was me. It started to become really distracting and I always have been that sort of person to really zone in to small things like bad breath and dandruff and I don't know why but I have always been like that. I fell asleep on the couch one day and it was one of those power sleeps and you know where you find it difficult to wake up but you try your hardest but your eyes seem to keep shutting down. I remember trying to open my tired eyes and it kept on closing and when I peeked through my slow opening eye lids, I saw a ragged. sad and rough looking man opening his mouth and breathing on me and his breath was just terrible that it literally knocked me out. I experienced an out of body experience and I was floating in the air and then I went back into my body. I awoke straight away and what I had noticed was that I had some straw under my couch and I started to bend it little by little until I had a zig zag straw and straightened it and re did it. It was the weirdest reaction to a weird dream I had though to myself at the time, thinking it was a dream. I knew it wasn't my breath and I could smell it you know still in my memory and I could still feel the disgusting texture of the bad breath. I came home from work one late night and my wife was a sleep and my child was also a sleep and I found many zig zag straws  on the front room table. I knew it was me that had done this but I didn't have clear memory of it and I un-zig zagged the straws and kept on doing it. It helped with dealing with the bad breath and my morning started to become extremely hard to handle. I would awake half a sleep while seeing many ragged, rough looking, people in my room all breathing on me and all with terrible bad breath. It caused me such agony and my brain was in pain and my body was shaking and shivering. I would desperately go the bathroom sweating as if I had sprinted in a hot country and wash myself. It became so bad I peoples breath even if it wasn't bad breath I just hated being breathed upon. I would always find straws on the floor or settees and I knew i had left it there but the memory of the act. I started to find comfort in zig zagging straws and I even started to chew them as it helped with the stress. When I started playing with straws that I left on the floor it started to bring back memories of those people causing me pain with their bad breath. Then I started zig zagging another straw which I had done before and just left somewhere and it gave me a flash back of when again of me being a victim to their bad breath. I was forgetting when I was being attacked and these straws started to become my way out and dealing with it, but it made me forget some of the attacks that had happened to me in the past. I started to become delusional and I was diagnosed with bipolar and my wife was started to become irritated with my behavior.   Then the worst still had to come when my young son just a toddler, found one of my straws on the floor which had been zig zagged by me and he started to chew it. i found my toddler on the floor shaking and looking petrified. I chewed the same straw and It took me back to when I was being attacked by those disgusting looking people all breathing on me and causing immense misery and then my son appeared as he chewed that straw which had a connection to that moment. I saw my son smelling their horrendous bad breath and even though it was causing me physical/mental and spiritual dis balance, my son who is just a toddler started screaming and wailing in immense pain. My wife who by now becoming extremely worried and the both of us rushed our toddler to the hospital. He was fine later on the day and thank god he started to show healthy signs of health in all parts. I didn't tell anyone but I started to think about what was happening to me and the straws. I guess the straws were an accident a reaction I mean if it wasn't the straws it would have been something else. I don't know why I was the victim but I guess no victim knows why they are picked, its just simple luck and chance. My wife wanted to see her parents and she was taking our son with her and being alone in the house really didn't feel too good later on and I went out to the bars. I had a few drinks but I wasn't too drunk and I stayed at a bar just watching television and watching others becoming drunk. As I got home I saw my front door broken and I knew someone had broken into my house. As I went inside I saw a man on the floor and he was wearing what all house burglars wear and I saw a straw in his hand and I took it off him. It showed that he broke in and then he saw a straw on the floor not 1 but many and he found it strange and he touched one and it took him an event in my past where those things where breathing their breath on me and then I saw him appear. I called the ambulance and police and later on just like my toddler he was fine. I have had to adapt to alot things and I have not figured out a way out but I have decided to keep lots of straws in a secret cupboard and I keep a separate bin so that I can throw the straws in their. I sometimes sleep somewhere else but these things are part of my life now. Its like a disease I guess you have got to find a way to live with it and I study yoga and other meditative mind strengthening techniques. I have tried having bad breath myself to see if that helps but it did nothing except making other people awkward around me. [info] None [info] 1463735617

LavanderMoon [info] I feel the same way. I've done therapy, was in it throughout my teens. I was never there for myself, I just there because of my parents or court orders... due to all the shit I had to deal with growing up. I was diagnosed with bipolar but I don't Believe that was accurate... It was based off my parents observations. Other therapist didn't agree either. I've had 4 different ones, the first one put me on drugs and in the Madison center at 13yrs old.I'm not Really that bitchy either. I believe he's become more sensitive over the years. I am pretty blunt, but I've always been this way. He also does dumbass shit like becoming a alcoholic( because his bestfriend is a drunk), pissing in my flowerbed ( he's drunk), and everyday things I've asked him 1,000 times to do ( he's lazy lazy or "forgets")He may benefit from therapy. He has issues from his childhood that I don't know how to deal with... [info] None [info] 1470668015

lotrfan12345 [info] Psychiatric prescriptions without therapy I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost two years ago and I've been unmedicated since then. I called a clinic to make an appointment because after doing some research I decided i'd like to try Lamictal.

syntheticgerbil [info] Luckily the calling work thing subsided after the first 3 years of the relationship, but it's like when I really started to think about her and BPD, that was one of the things I had read that stood out, since it was odd she used to be so clingy to that point. Also I didn't have a cell phone until 2008 I think. So now if there's some kind of cling or panic, it's just a lot of texts.I would like to get into therapy but I've been working contract stuff for the last three years and I'd either have to get third party healthcare or pay to be on my wife's plan. Both are not affordable for me by a long shot. I go to a psychiatrist because I was diagnosed with bipolar II back in 2011 so I do talk to him sometimes but it's not the same. I did do about 4 years of regular CBT therapy though from 2008 to 2012 so I still try to apply things like that I learned every day to keep the bipolar sadness at bay. They don't concern the mania part of Bipolar II so I just take a mood stabilizer every day that my psychiatrist seemed to figure out the perfect dosage for and I often just feel pretty content throughout my days.But yes, I hope to get into maybe DBT therapy myself if I can find a full time job with benefits. As it is right now, when I need healthcare stuff that isn't regular therapy, it's cheaper to just get the cash discounts and no insurance discounts as well pay the tax penalty.

RackingCaecilian [info] How to explain bipolar to my family? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder just over two years ago. With meds I’ve become fairly stable but I still have mild hypomanic symptoms, and definitely still have depressive episodes. A lot of my family knows that I have bipolar disorder, and recently I’ve been trying to reach out to them for support. It seems like when I try to talk about it they just assume that because I’m on medication that I should be totally fine. When I tell them I’m having a bad day they often try to tell me “everybody has bad days, you’ll be fine” except my bad days means I don’t get out of bed, or fight the urge to hurt myself. I don’t want to get into the details of how bad my bad days are with them, but I do want them to understand that this disorder effects my day to day life, even if I am medicated. Has anyone else ever experienced this? Thanks! [info] None [info] 1518893280
InfiniteBlink [info] In there with ya.  I don't get the classic hangover with the physical debilitating body pain. Never get headaches or puke.  I feel like utter garbage though mentally.  I was diagnosed with bipolar about 19 years ago.  I took meds for a few months, felt great got my shit straight and started in my success path.Outwardly at 33 I've got everything you would associate with a successful life, career and possession wise. I have a huge social circle and do well with the ladies.Yet... There is a void I can't fill. I don't know what it is, but drinking and being social keeps me happy until the next day when I'm not.   Then I just repeat over and over.  My friends have no idea how I can rally night after night of going haaaaard.I'm thinking of going to see a psych again cuz my shit may be acting up again and I could be in a deflationary spiral and trying to use drugs and alcohol to give me the high I crave.Sorry for the rant, all these posts have me evaluating stuff.

nearlynoon [info] Hey brother,I'm going to give you two inputs: one religious and one more clinical.On the religious side, we all experience these moment of doubt, sometimes very severe like it sounds you are going through now. The Fathers called them 'aridities' after the desert they lived in. I have experienced them. Your brothers and sisters here on the sub have experienced them. Your pastor has had them. The Pope has had them. The important part is to stay strong, survive this temptation to fear and falling away, and you will be restored. St. John of the Cross wrote the famous book 'The Dark Night of the Soul' on this matter, although it's a little hard to read. I would recommend Thomas Moore's similarly-titled book 'Dark Nights of the Soul' as a easier-to-digest primer. Moore works as a therapist, and he has a gentle hand in his writings.On the more clinical side, I have experience with anxieties like this, severe ones that kept me from sleeping and left me feeling like I was about to pitch head-first into a deep void. I had these throughout the period when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and they made normal life extremely difficult. It sounds like your anxieties are reaching a sort of stage where they are impacting your life maybe, and if so, please see a doctor and ask for a referral to a therapist. There's no shame in it, and it may nip it in the bud before it has a chance to get worse. Remember, God will be by your side.My prayers are for your quick return to the fullness of your faith and lack of fear. God bless. [info] Roman Catholic [info] 1495235888

iggidybiggidy [info] Medications to stabilise mood swings in PTSD? Hello what medications are available to help stabilise my mood swings? I have an active PTSD diagnosis. About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar and on Quetiapine (Seroquel) until last summer. I do not have bipolar, the diagnosis was wrong (admitted by psych).Since coming off the meds I've been re-experiencing symptoms that lead to my bipolar diagnosis. I'm now on 45mg of Mirtazapine but over the past week things have gotten very bad and I've had two mental health assessments at two different hospitals in the space of 3 days.I have been feeling highly irritable, aggressive, very upset at times, I threatened someone with physical violence, acting reckless, drinking excessively and engaged in risky drug taking behaviour. I spoke to the crisis team today (UK based, NHS service for mental health issues in the community) who told me to wait 2 weeks to see if the increased dosage of Mirtazapine has any effect.

Kighla [info] I wonder if he has some major self confidence issues, thus the need to "appear busy/useful".This reminds me so so much of myself about two years ago. I had just moved in with my boyfriend, was unaware of the fact I was bipolar, and started to get depressed.As I got depressed getting work done was harder for me. Everything seemed like a challenge and I started to realize I was getting nothing done. I'm also very ADHD and I tend to not notice very obvious things wrong (like doors falling off hinges) because I'm too focused on some small insignificant thing. Anyway, I got more and more depressed and was doing less and less work. Every day I felt like a bigger disappointment to my boyfriend. He would practically beg me to help but I would sulk and say I was too tired or it was too much. Any task he'd try to give me, I'd get an excuse not to. If he tried to give me ANY sort of criticism, even something small (like buying the wrong brand of whatever) I would get hyper defensive.The more and more depressed and lazy I got, the more and more self conscious and defensive I felt. I got it in my head that I was so fucking lazy and when he was home I tried to prove I was doing stuff, so I would do weird insignificant tasks loudly to be noticed. But I only did things I felt comfortable with, and neglected actual chores.Months passed by and our relationship got really fucked. He ended up losing it and we almost broke up. Luckily we both decided to do couples counseling and individual counseling and our relationship is very strong. Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar and started on medications that have helped me immensely. So perhaps it could end up being very positive for him too to go through the therapy to find out what's wrong. [info] None [info] 1478809577
clumsyrunner [info] Don't sell yourself short to yourself. You're an amazing human.I experienced a massive acquired brain injury (ABI) 5 years ago this November. I've re-learned to speak, read, write, and think in English; I've learned to breathe on my own, stand, walk, and am currently learning to jog and run again.My memory is shot; I've forgotten most of my pre-ABI life, and though I've been able to begin to remember some of it, I will eventually forget that I've already remembered it before. For example, I've remembered losing my baby in a car wreck when I was 19 (I'm still in my 20's) - multiple times. But I'm able to hold on to the memories longer and longer each time I remember. Thanks, neuroplasticity!Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar type II with psychopathy and schizoaffective traits. I've attempted suicide several times in the last 5 years, both before and after my psychological diagnosis. I kept seeing images of people writing or drawing on themselves rather than self-harming. Now (as of maybe 2 weeks ago), I use non-toxic, skin-safe markers to draw on myself rather hurting myself.Killing myself has been on my mind near daily for the past year, but being able to look at things I've placed around my apartment to help me remember who I am and what I've been able to survive, keeps me alive.So, anytime you feel like or think of doing IT, take a moment think of what you've been through in your short life; make it your goal to live through the next hour. Then, live through the next 8 hours, day, week, month, year. Repeat. Take it moment by moment, step by painful step, and never give up because t's never been better than making it to the moment you're living now.You'll be okay. Never give up. It's never been better. You're okay. Stay alive. You're still okay. [info]  [info] 1536243330
cheesypenguin78 [info] Hi! I'm new to Reddit in general and I am so grateful to find this subreddit. I'm fairly young (24), but my husband and I started trying to get pregnant 3.5 years ago. After no success and a miscarriage, we decided to go see my doctor to figure out what was going on. We didn't really get a clear answer. They told me to take ovulation tests and for three months, there was never a positive one. We went back to the doctor and we're given some options for treatment but turned them down. We don't make very much money and my insurance at the time didn't cover anything.  Now we are at the point where we have better insurance, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So we are unsure if we should do any treatment because we are unsure how introducing new hormones will affect me. Has anyone dealt with doing treatment with a mood disorder?

seekingzen1 [info] Okay OP, you’ve been given some great advice here that mostly can be worked in after you have quieted your mind.  I’m an academic, PhD and bipolar.  I also am a bit older than a typical I went straight through from my undergrad to MA and then PhD.  Why?  I chose to get some life experience to work out what I wanted to do and then in my PhD, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had a 3 year pause before I finished.So I’m going to start in a different place. And please don’t answer these questions here.1.  Type of Bipolar 1 or 2.  If 1. Are you high functioning, medically compliant and able to function or are you struggling in any of these areas.  If you’re struggling in any of these areas, put education to the side.  Get treated, get functional, and maintain for a year before looking at school again.  Type 2, is it managed?2.  An associates is a respectable degree!  Can you do what you would like with it?3.  Is it your goal to finish undergrad or are you fulfilling a promise to your grandfather.  If you do this, you have to be in it for your own reasons...a degree has to be more important to you than it is to wanting to please someone else.  Your grandfather sounds amazing but is he accepting?4.  What type of support system do you have?  Are you accepted and supported?  If not, I would start looking for that support from other people and communities.  There is a great bipolar community here.OP, I think before you can find answers to these questions about school and work, you need to make mental health your first priority.  If it is great!  If it isn’t,  I can empathize bc making decisions when symptomatic is often impossible or unwise.  Can you talk to your grandfather?  Is he supportive?  And finally you have to establish a support system that you can rely on.  That knows you, supports you, guides you and keeps you compliant if needed.  I think if you address these things first, you will find there are interdisciplinary majors that would allow you to combine your interests.  Set some measurable goals and truly figure out is school is the best avenue at this time.  Once I stopped living by someone else’s definition of time, I made much more progress!Feel free to dm me!

MrPoppagergio [info] This is my first time writing in this sub. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 two and a half years ago. To answer your question, I have this same exact thing happen to me frequently. For me, it all started when my psychiatrist asked me the first time, "Have you had any homicidal or suicidal thoughts?" At that point I hadn't. After I left his office that day I began to contemplate what he said more on in depth. Now, sometimes I think about killing myself but I know deep down inside I don't want to. It's like it's just a sparked thought. I don't know why this happens and it sort of scares me at times. Reason being is that if I'm watching tv and it's a show about murder I sometimes picture myself (this is going up sound weird) killing a loved one of mine in a similar fashion. I am a little uncertain as to why this happens but I don't know what to do. I'm a little scared to talk to anyone about it because of fear of changing my meds and having to start over. I've been stable for the last two years and 5 months and I haven't had anything happen that makes me afraid for my life or anyone else's. I hope I answered your question and please feel free to discuss it more. I was overjoyed to see that this sub existed.  [info] None [info] 1392133817

ThorsPineal [info] Lithium Side Effect on Psychic Ability About three years ago, in my mid 30s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD.In many cases, having extreme highs and lows has been a challenge. However, it has also allowed me to access areas of consciousness that most people I assume never do. One of which has been brief moments of psychic visions. Anyway, I've been off and on Depakote and continued to have interesting experiences with time manipulation and consciousness exploration. Recently, however,  I switched to lithium. Suddenly I feel "normal."  No more staying up for many hours contemplating the mysterious nature of consciousness and the universe. No more traveling into fascinating foreign dimensions within my mind. No more flashes of intense intuition. I am benefiting from the stable mood in some ways. I'm going to continue using it for now. I'm just a little disappointed about the loss of creativity. Anyone have advice or experience with this kind of thing? [info] None [info] 1519831846
fe_ursus [info] 27 female here too. Was tentatively diagnosed last December and put on cymbalta. My autoimmune tests and Lyme all came back normal/negative and MRI didn't show any damage to my joints. Cymbalta helped for a bit, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar after it put me in the hospital. Once I've been treated for the bipolar, a lot of the symptoms have lessened tremendously. I would recommend seeing a therapist, even if no mental illness is in your family. Fibromyalgia is so isolating bc it's so poorly understood and it takes a toll on you mentally as well. I'm so happy that you're getting relief with the new meds!! This group is fantastic and everyone is so accepting and understanding.Other things that have helped are yoga and low impact exercises. My husband got me an exercise bike and I've been able to regularly work out and my joint pain and back pain are getting better and I'm getting strength back.

Mephistia [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen, and always suspected I was misdiagnosed --- long story, family background and mom projecting her own illness and I actually have ADHD and whatnot -- but one of the key factors in my ultimate realization that I was in fact not bipolar was reading about how the disorder presents in children. Apparently bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are beginning to be viewed by some as less separate illnesses and more as the same illness on a spectrum of severity. Normally, these mental health disorders present in adulthood -- twenties, as our brains finish developing.Occasionally, they present much younger. I read a series of articles in the early aughts in Tme and Parenting and some medical journals about bipolar presentation in children, and they all basically said that kids who have bipolar will act out in extremely violent, self-harming,and repetitive ways. It's confusing to psychiatrists who are used to looking for "adult" markers of manic and depressive cycles, but the youth of the child means they lack the emotional maturity and structures of dealing with extremes in emotion, so they respond by becoming violent or dissociative. Also, hallucinations  (auditory, visual, and tactile) are normative symptoms in a bipolar manic state. So while its impossible for a layperson to diagnose over the internet, I would strongly suggest that you try to find a child psychiatrist who specializes in bipolar disorder to look him over, just in case. If nothing else, they might have suggestions or ideas for a direction in which to point you.  [info] None [info] 1452713879

stealthb0y [info] Bipolar 2 My mental health has been really bad lately and I just felt like venting a little about it and possibly getting to talk to others who experience similar problems. It helps not feelings alone with thisI'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, and my depressive swings outweigh my hypomanic ones by a ton. I can be feeling perfectly fine and something small will happen--or nothing at all!--and I fly into debilitating sadness and suicidal feelings and endless crying. Sometimes it lasts only a few hours but it can last for days at a time before I stabilize again, and I always feel so ridiculous for how I was acting when I was down. It feels like I become an entirely different person and I'm not in control of myself.I also can't help but feel bad for my friends when I'm hypomanic. I suddenly have energy, and I want to talk to them a ton and do things and I'm happy and social, just for it to inevitably go back down and I turn into a hermit for a period of time. Over the past week my friends have watched me go from crying for hours to cracking jokes and then back to silent sadness and so on and so forth. I can barely keep track of it, I can't imagine how it feels for them.I'm seeing a doctor and I'm on medication, which has helped, but I think what would really help right now is hearing from other people who can relate, so I appreciate anyone who reaches out.

When I was diagnosed with bipolar I was almost relieved because someone had finally put a name to what I was dealing with. My regular psychiatrist said I think about two months ago that he thinks I have borderline in addition to being bipolar. I was hospitalized for a week after being fired from my job and there they also said that they’re thinking I have borderline as well.After the first time being told this I was in denial.  The second time I threw a little fit.Since being out of the hospital I’ve been googling things like crazy and I’m starting to realize that I probably do have borderline personality disorder. I still don’t want to admit it though.But kind of replaying my life in my head the symptoms of this disorder are becoming more and more apparent to me. Sorry for the long rant, just wanted to get the thoughts out of my head. [info] None [info] 1540603624
iDuckie [info] I am a 32 y/o female with bipolar type 2 &amp; ADHD - AMA! Bit of background on my diagnoses: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1999 and it was left mostly untreated until January of this year. My ADHD diagnosis was made in October of last year and treatment started in February. Looking back to my younger years, it very well could have been diagnosed a long time ago (before the bipolar diagnosis) and I was not aware of it or action wasn't taken to subdue it.I can also ask my husband questions if you're curious about what it's like to live with a nutter like myself.

CountessAmara [info] Anyone have any experience with DBT? So I was referred by my counselor to a DBT licensed clinical social worker. *Background: I was diagnosed with bipolar over a year ago. I moved and am using my work's employee assistance program until I secure my own therapist. They hinted that I may have borderline personality disorder instead.*I have my first DBT appointment Thursday. I am so nervous and am hoping someone could give me an idea of what to expect from this session. I briefly browsed reddit for answers on what exactly to expect with no help.Thanks! 😊 [info] None [info] 1479264621

lordmania [info] Venting: Mania induced psychosis causing temporary amnesia. I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features and I'm having a really difficult time. Work has been hectic and stress very high. I can't currently afford to see a psychiatrist so I've been unmedicated for 14 months now. I keep slipping into long manic episodes that last weeks to months that eventually end up in me slipping into psychosis and being hospitalized. The worst of this is the temporary amnesia though. I recently lost my love to overdose and my cat to cancer, and every time I return home from the hospital I forget that they're both dead. I search for them, panic because I can't find them anywhere, and usually end up realizing they've died once I see my cat's urn on my bed frame (I snuggle it to feel calm, I know it's weird). Seeing her urn then, in turn, reminds me that my love is also now dead. This ends up in me crying uncontrollably until I disassociate. Rinse, repeat, every few weeks. It's like I keep reliving their deaths over and over and nothing I do seems to stop my brain from resetting. I wish I could afford a psychiatrist and medication again, because I can't take anymore heartbreak.I just don't know what to do. Anyway, sorry this is so melancholy. I appreciate anyone who read it all. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1577092373
persiancatlady [info] Separated and confused I (21F - diagnosed BP last month) have been separated from my husband (H) (29M) since December 2018. We were married for a year and it was constantly up and down. I knew he has Aspergers at the beginning of the relationship and I always thought that was the problem. (Though in actuality it is part of it). We had a lot of fights about lack of communication and I admittedly did a lot of complaining, pushing and crying. We attempted marriage counseling and it did not work for us. I became incredibly depressed and unable to do anything productive. H could not handle me as I would be calling him dozens of times all morning while he was at working absolutely freaking out and by night time I was up all night and unable to do anything around the house. At the time, I didn’t see any problem with how I behaved and thought he was the one ruining the marriage. It all came to a head in December and I had my first dose of mania. I was freaking out on him constantly when I found out H hired an attorney and was ready to file. He attempted to keep me out of our house so I did not take or destroy his property as he believed I was out of control. His parents got themselves involved - another story. Long story short, I had to break into my own home to get my toothbrush and clothing and I was completely moved four hours away within the same week. While what he did was also not right, I was not stable and I do recognize I was out of control at the time. I moved back home four hours away because I didn’t want anything to do with him and I filed to divorce before he got to it. He had me blocked and refused to speak to me. Long story short, I got myself into therapy and was quickly referred to a pdoc who put me on lamictal a month ago and I am now up to 100mg and much more stable. I’ve recognized a lot of where I went wrong. H called me in February stating that he still loved me and did not want a divorce. We have had multiple visits and each time has improved our relationship. I am continuing my medication and therapy. We have also discussed what happened in length, which is communication I never thought we would have. H has suggested plans for the future, for me to attend school in the state with him, for me to move back, and has even mentioned future children. During visits, everything is like way back when things were good. However, when I return home, he reverts back saying he doesn’t know what he wants and he is scared to try again. The ease he has to ignore me by phone causes me intense duress because my mind immediately jumps to the worst. I’ve expressed to H many times that I recognize how my bipolar impacted things. I do not take 100% of he blame. The main issue is that I am needing to know whether he is in or out because I need to make plans for my life going forward. Ultimately, I would love my marriage to work out but overall I just want to make the right choice so we are both happy. I am having a terrible time trying to be patient while he processes what he wants. I’m questioning if I am being impulsive or nagging him. I would like to hear from spouses of SO’s with bipolar. Do I need to give him more time? Am I being rational in thinking that you either want this or you don’t? From February 14th to now, is it unrealistic to expect some type of answer from him? TL;DR: Aspie husband and I had a rough first year of marriage. He hired attorney behind my back, I offered to leave then. Disagreements led to a nasty separation. Divorce has been filed and is pending. I was diagnosed with bipolar during this time and have sought treatment. Husband called out of the blue wanting to reconcile. Have attempted visits with success but husband is on the fence and will not provide a definite answer on if he wants to reconcile. His indecision is causing me intense pain and grief that I am unable to cope with. Should I give him more time to decide or learn to walk away? [info] None [info] 1556141292
rivanne [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar in January and dropped out of college. But I also have responded very well to treatment, (officially) moved in with my boyfriend and--best of all--got engaged! I'm going back to school in the fall and I'm probably about to get a job (unemployed for a year). The bipolar diagnosis has been an absolute blessing, and I'm finally starting to feel stable after years of struggling. I'm happier than I've ever been.

phatalphreak [info] 18 years ago when I was 15 I got tired of being bullied. So I took my dive knife to school, it was 12 inches long and looked scary as hell with a serrated back but was actually really dull. I was going to confront my bully and make him apologize. I was young and dumb and showed it off to some friends, one of them told on me and I was arrested. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent 2 years bouncing around between 9 psychiatric facilities and juvenile detention. I had a lot of adventures, lost my virginity, got into fights, tried all kinds of interesting drugs and picked up several fun hobbies. The one thing I remember most was at every facility the food was always really good. At one place we actually had a chef who was a graduate from the Cordon Bleue. If I have any advice to give it would be that the sooner you stop resiting the treatment, accept that you need help, and work with the counsellors, the better you will start to feel and the sooner you can get out and start living your life. This is the tl:dr of my story, if you feel like digging way down through my post history you will find a link to the full story or when I get home on my pc I might go look for it and edit it into this post.

nickcrish [info] my story (what I remember) Hi new here, been reading the last few days of posts here has really given me hope.  Just thought I could share a bit of my journey with you.  I was 19 when I was diagnosed with bipolar II (I'm 25 now).  At the time I was in a hospital after a fairly extensive drug binge.  Which lead me to the new cozy feeling of mania.  During this mania I had been kicked out of a drug den.  Which you know you've messed up if this is the case.  I decided to bike to my parents house(in a fit of spite). Approximately a 30 minute freeway drive.  I naturally didn't make it.  I remember finding a bed in a dumpster and a piece of cardboard which I used as a blanket.  I rested after being hopelessly lost.Somehow the next day I make it to a hospital and call my parents house.  This was still a time when I remembered a lot of phone numbers off the top of my head.  Even in mania.  I got a hold of my mom, who I told where I was and she picked me up a little while later.I remember rambling about ruling the world.  There was an intervention a lot of my friends and family were around.  Gave me an ultimatum that I should go to a hospital.  I eventually submit.  End up going to hospital.  The hospital times are pretty vague.  I drew a lot to pass the time.  Made a lot of single use friends.I'm pretty sure I spent three months in the hospital.  Because they were waiting for a closed treatment facility for me.  That was a blast.  Gang banger's everywhere.  Scary people who I wanted nothing to do with were now the closet things I'd get to friends.  Drew some more to pass the time.  The three months there pass slowly.  I remember the joys of seeing my parents on days we were allowed visitors.  Depending on staff on duty I might be allowed to get hugs from my family.  I just felt like weeping the entire time.  It was just shy of jail.Eventually that passes and then I end up in a halfway house.  Stay there for yet another three months.  Trying to get my life together after that massive down that happens after a mania.  It felt nice to be able to walk around outside though.I wish I was able to remember more about the mania but the lapses in time are very real with the first one.  As well as recently brain fog has been huge in my life.  Thanks for reading this! [info] None [info] 1519837835
uniquenamechosen-__- [info] What is a day lioe in the life of an experimental psychologist (and would you recommend it)? Hello all,I'm 24 and I've been jumping around between majors quite a bit lately, but the only thing that has stayed a constant interest is experimental psychology (correct me if I'm using this term wrong, I've only just started really looking into it). I've done what I can to avoid this field of study due to seemingly every person having a bachelors in this and never working in the field. From what I've gathered, it is a must to have a PhD, which is understandable.I like the research idea because I want to know what makes people tick, and I love figuring out why the brain does such weird things, but I'm not so good at connecting with others face to face. Honestly, I feel I'd be terrible in any therapy type position. Before, I was leaning more toward software engineering due to the enormous flexibility of the job after college and that seems amazing, but I find myself struggling to even want to go because I'm less passionate for the major than I had expected. I was in the military for a few years, so I have worked upward 90+ hours a week before, but I'm not necessarily looking forward to doing that permanently. And lastly, this ones a bit personal but I'm throwing it out there, I'm diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD. I know "technically" this wouldn't knock me out of a job, but sometimes I need some time to deal with the moods. Does anyone have experience with this illness in this field? Or by chance, know someone in a similar situation? Would you still recommend it from a practical standpoint (I'd really hate to go all the way to PhD and not be able to hold a job due to this illness..)?TLDR; What is your schedule like daily/weekly? Do you get vacation? Weekends? Is the work fulfilling? Can someone with their own mental problems go into this field and safely hold a job?Sorry it's so long and for any typos! This was typed on my phone. Thank you everyone for reading this!Edit: Aargh, the title got me!! [info] None [info] 1492914213

coleserra [info] I used to work with my Dad. One night I was having serious suicidal idealation to the point where I layed on some train tracks for a good 20 minutes. The next day I went to work and had I complete breakdown. I decided to talk to my Dad, had no one else to talk to at the time. I told him everything.His response?"Man the fuck up and keep that shit to yourself, you're a grown man, act like it."   I tried "manning up" for the majority of my adult life. You know what happened? I became a hardcore alchoholic who constantly wanted to kill myself or do something risky. Finally my Uncle and my ex convinced me to see a psych and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Even then, I didn't take my medication until a few months later because it made me feel so weak and I really did feel like less of a man. [info] None [info] 1565035905

And they're not going to give up on you. I know it's so easy to take it out on them because they're right there in front of you. They're the ones trying to force things and make you "better." My advice is to just tell them you love them tomorrow or next week, sometime, just a little sign to them that this challenge is worth it for all of you. You WILL get through this. They won't give up if you don't. Edit: sorry, read that as your dad wanted to take you, I see now it's your mom. Either way I feel like they really do care.  [info] None [info] 1451198604

lostinzephyr [info] So, on this whole self-diagnosis/ableism/being fucked up in the head is so cool trend on tumblr, from someone who is fucked up in the head. I need to vent about this, so here goes.My name is Eli. I'm 19. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December. I'd been dealing with it for a two years before that. I'm fucked up in the head. Crazy. Mentally insane. Aboslutley gaga. And I am so fucking sick of the tumblr culture that romanticizes an illness that has ruined my life, got me kicked out of college, and says it okay to self-diagnose yourself with something so fucking serious that causes me to literally not function without meds, and heck, I sound like a fucking whiny looser from simply saying that, but WTF. There you have it. I cannot function as a normal fucking human being if I do not take my meds. I see the self-diagnosis posts, and I want to punch someone. "but people can't aff-" If you have bipolar, chances are, you'll be taken into hospital eventually because you'll eventually get so so sick that you become a threat to yourself and others. "but the DSM is the invention of a white cis-" Fuck you. My psych is an asian dude, and he's the one who diagnosed me. Fuck you. "But people know themselves!" No, they do not. I spent last summer believing I could hear peoples thoughts. Genuinly fucking believing that. I heard them saying they were going to kill me. I am so fucking terrified that that will happen again. People who are sick like that do not know themselves. I certainly do not. And Ableism, where do I begin with that? Hey! They don't give a shit! They're all for coddling us like we're so so sensitive we must be protective from a few words. "Crazy" "Insane" "Mad". Yeah. Dude, I'm fucking crazy, certifiably so, and I am not offended. It's not just me. I've dealt with so many other "crazy" people who use the word to describe themselves and don't give a monkeys.There are real godamn issues. What about the shortage of hospital beds, meaning that those who need one often have to stay hours away from family and friends in an enviroment that is already scary and horrible enough as it is? What about the cuts to medical funding, and in particular, mental health funding, that is causing so many people who deal with a mental illness to not recieve any treatment or support, unless they are in a crisis? What about the fact that people who turn up to ER after a suicide attempt can still be denied help even after that?Apparently though, a few words a more important than that though. And the glamourization. God, I can't stand that. MY ILLNESS IS NOT YOUR GODAMN IDENTITY, AND IF I HEAR THAT PHRASE ONE MORE TIME, I WILL SHOOT YOU. It does not get some pet name such as "bianca" or whatever, that you can run around saying "oh I have bianca". You do not get to say "just deal with it" when you self diagnosed yourself with this disorder thanks to a couple of normal, teenage mood swings. Ever felt so low you could not pull yourself out of bed? Swallowed some tablets, landed in hospital? And then felt so full of energy that you can't rest for a single second, can't sleep at all because you have so many ideas and every single sound is so loud and everything so bright and that great feeling turns to irritation where the sound of something breathing ticks you off so much that you punch them in the face? For breathing? Ever had mood swings like that last not for a few minutes or hours, but for days? That is bipolar. That is not normal behaviour. Not in any realm of normal. On my meds, I am fine. I act like a normal person. I do not have massive mood swings like that. If I miss a dose, I start to feel the mood swings again. If I don't take them, I cannot function as a human being and I will walk into a shop and spend every single penny I have on enough boxes of cereal to feed the population of a small country "just cos" I felt like it. And people on tumblr seriously thing it's some "identity". By saying I hated it, I once got told by some tumblrite brat that I had "internalized ableism". That the only problem was that society did not understand my illness and taught me that it was bad. That I needed to get over that mindset. There. Like I said, I am very much aware that I sound like some sort of looser. Believe me, I am not proud of the fact that I have bipolar. I hate it. And I wish I could say that I'm not ashamed of the fact that I have it...but I am. And tumblr SJW's spewing there bullshit pisses me off. [info] None [info] 1398358446

craycraythrowaway69 [info] Speaking for myself, I'm diagnosed with bipolar and I can tell you that I am sick. Before I got on lithium, I was tortured by obsessive thoughts of being stabbed in the genitals, among other horrible, almost unbearable symptoms. Every waking moment of my life was torture. After I went to a doctor and got on medication, *poof*, the obsessive thoughts went away and I my life stopped being a waking nightmare. I agree, the pharma industry is beyond fucked, and we as a society need to change the way some "mental illnesses" are looked at.

Your analogy toward uncomfortable therapy sessions is pretty spot on - that feeling of facing something you've been avoiding so that you can work yourself through it. It's definitely why I naturally gravitate towards things like LiS.&gt; Whether that's healthy or not is subjective I guessYeah, that's the tricky part. To the extent I've seen in some places, I really don't think it is. But I mean, I know that *I* do a ton of unhealthy things to cope, so I don't have a leg to stand on. I guess it's just a "do as I say, not as I do" thing. I just get worried about people.  [info] None [info] 1469960757
ObsessedAloof [info] My experiences with bipolar and harm ocd So it's my first post here, kind of forcing myself to write something after lurking for a long time. This is just what I have been going through for a long time, and I'm hoping that others can relate.So I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago, and ocd within the past year or two, specifically harm ocd. My doctor has been a great help and the medicine has worked wonders. Currently on Lamictal and most recently Latuda. Anyway, the weird thing that started happening this past year is, without realizing it, I was starting to experience the symptoms of bipolar psychosis. I began hearing a voice in my head related to the ocd telling me to hurt those around me, telling me I'd become powerful or godlike or whatever weird bs is associated with a voce in your head. However, instead of being repulsed by it like other ocd sufferers are, I would instead be elated and excited by it. I came to realize later that it's because I was feeling manic, so of course my emotions toward it were warped. I started feeling paranoid, having delusions and dissociating with reality, not feeling like anything was real. It finally came to a head a few months ago, where it caused me to lose my job. I was at work and had been feeling paranoid and delusional, and that was where the psychosis really hit me. I don't remember much of what happened, but the fight-or-flight, kill or be killed instinct kicked in to high gear, and I barely remember just walking out. At this point I had actually started identifying with these feelings and feeling like it was just who I am. I didn't like the feelings per se, but I started wondering if this was real or something instead of just delusions. I was even listening to music on repeat that exacerbated the feelings, a lot of heavy metal but in particular [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGwmkghsFz4), as it described perfectly how I felt. Needless to say, it didn't help.Anyway, I told my doctor and he put me on Latuda. I was very resistant toward taking it as it felt like I was killing a part of myself that I'd identified with for so long. For a couple of months I was in psychosis off and on as I refused to take the medicine. It wasn't until I pulled a knife on my roommate during a minor argument that I realized how bad it was. Nobody was hurt, and I was suddenly very aware of what was really happening.I started taking the medicine finally, still not happy about it but forcing myself. Over time the voice has gone away, I'm feeling more grounded in reality, and I'm not paranoid or as anxious. I'm in a new state to be with family now, and I've found some bipolar support groups near me that I'm going to start going to. A previous employer and friend of mine instilled a "get in the solution" mentality in me, and that's what I've been reminding myself every day. My family is very supportive too, as I've told them most of what happened. I'm not sure if others can relate to the whole story, but if any parts sound familiar it would be good to be reminded that I'm not the only one who's dealt with psychosis or anything else, and I'm just glad that I found this subreddit.

WHAT-WOULD-HITLER-DO [info] The worst part is that the more religious a theocratic politician is, the more sociopathic and callous their political ideology tends to be. Christian voters here are mobilized for the most fucked up things, like oppressing their LGBT brothers and sisters or making sure fellow Americans can't have feasible access to basic healthcare. Obamacare saved my life shortly after the age I can stay on my mom's plan was extended. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of trying to manage symptoms with alcohol and xanax because insurance companies usually didn't cover mental health services (which cost hundreds of dollars a visit for psychiatrists, at least $100 for the cheapest therapists who usually are just starting out and haven't established themselves yet). Plus I was just about to get kicked off because of the age cutoff, so other basic chronic health issues would have become a major financial strain. These bible thumping fuckers think what jesus would do (WWJD is a common thing on bracelets and whatnot) is tell me to pray about it and if my prayers aren't answered it's because I lack faith/am a sinner. So yeah in my mind the opposite is to distort/white wash/historically revise the polar opposite (Hitler vs Jesus) and pretend that Hitler was the altruistic and deeply empathetic leader who tried to bring about positive social change. Don't intend for it to be trolly in the sense of being online and starting arguments for dumb shit, but I can see why it comes off that way. I like comedy and I like to laugh at dark shit. My family came as refugees from antisemitism to the US when the USSR collapsed in 1993. I think the cure to all social fuckery is to laugh at how absurd it all is. Take the seriousness out of it, take away the power of words and references that are painful and destructive (and at times, genocidal/institutionally oppressive). As a female I love gender/sexist jokes and being in an interracial relationship my bf and I love racial humior. Rather than being angry at racism or sexism, we can destroy the power it has through laughter. Fresh Prince of Bellaire, Eddy Murphy movies, and comics who made it ok to laugh at race in the 90s really did have a major impact on white people who otherwise had a lot of shitty opinions on black people. I saw it in my parents and friend's parents growing up. Even seemingly "racist" jokes, when executed masterfully by great comedians and in epic movies/sitcoms, I think all contributed to easing how seriously people took themselves and their hatred towards others by forcing them to laugh against their will. Sure some jokes are a net negative, but those need to be able to exist too if we want the more fun stuff to be allowed to flourish. Like how Megan Kelly and others get fired for offending people, congrats, now you taught racists to just keep their shitty opinions private so that, as the late great Patrice O'neal pointed out repeatedly, he has no way of knowing who's racist. Which means he can't talk to them honestly and maybe change their minds. He "never met a racist", so he knew people existed who *thought* "nigger", but had no way of knowing if the person being polite to him hated him deep inside or was genuinely a nice person. On the other hand if we didn't try to censor people and let them be honest, we can laugh at the shitty things they say and take that power away genuinely vs just pretending it doesn't exist (which is does, but people learn to keep it covert, so you seem ridiculous for insisting it's real). To me, Hitler jokes do the same thing. Better to laugh at the insanity than to get outraged and radicalize people by fighting shittiness with shittiness. [info] None [info] 1555948184
katsudoom [info] Migraine free due to... therapy? Hello, everyone. I used to post here a lot with an old account but ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I decided to make a new one and focused on this new issue instead of my old friend migraine.I have migraines since 7 years old, my worst times were when I was a teenager because I did poorly in school due the lack of presence in class. Together with mood changes I always had migraines tagging along, so there was always a excuse to left jobs and miss compromises.Now I'm 26, I was having a terrible year full of migraines and mood swings and after a episode I committed to therapy like never before. Got my right diagnosis and things have been very good if you ask me about migraines. I knew I was a stressed person but I never thought therapy would help that much.Of course, I'm still on medication. I was taking topamax and I'm still on it, now together with Depakote. I don't know if mixing them is also a positive thing.All that I know is: since December I haven't been in pain. To be totally honest, i ate chocolate the other day and felt a pseudo migraine but it went away with a cup of coffee and a triptan pill.So I was thinking, how many of you can benefit from therapy too, right? If you feel stressed, depressed and fed up because of anything and can make a way to find professional help, why not trying?I don't know maybe I'm being too positive but maybe someone is also like I was and never thought that talking to a therapist can help. Truth is.. Some of us need it. [info] None [info] 1491942641

iphoneoffmychest [info] I completely relate to this. I was diagnosed with bipolar-II almost exactly ten years ago to the day, and I am what you might call "high functioning." Though apparently, I am not high-functioning enough to write this damn paper due tomorrow...In the ten years since my diagnosis, I graduated high school and college (with highest honors), and then went straight into my dream job in an awesome city. During my post-college years, I built a wonderful and fulfilling life and last year I was admitted to all six graduate programs I applied to. Two weeks after accepting an offer at the best program in my field, I checked myself into a hospital delusional and suicidal. I'd run up $5k in credit card debt, was sleeping four hours a day, and was dating an abusive cokehead. He was the only person I could trust since the rest of my friends were conspiring to humiliate me...somehow (thanks, crazy!).Please don't hold it in. Don't let it get to that point. If you're thinking of checking yourself into a hospital, you're probably at the point when you should. Be honest with your doctors and with your support network; they want to help you live your best life *with* bipolar and not in spite of it. Ignoring it and powering through *is not sustainable*. Part of the reason I got so bad last year was that I wasn't honest with my psychiatrist and because to my support network, I seemed "okay" even when I was verbally saying I wasn't. I'm now working with a psychiatrist at my university who is very experienced at working with "high functioning" people living with mental illness. When you're in a mood episode, it can be very easy to lose sight of how severe things actually are and those around you may not pick up on it either because your life *looks* so together. Your friends, family, and coworkers love you. They want you happy and well. When you're depressed you can't tell how much they love you. [info] None [info] 1526361355
retconneds [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14 - dropped out of school, severely depressed, hospitalized several times and on a lot of medication - and my mum basically put her entire life on hold for me. Single mother and only child - we were incredibly, incredibly close. I can barely process how awful my illness must have been for her and I know I was absolutely horrible to her for during that time and caused her so much pain and suffering. She died unexpectedly when I was 16, and in the 4 and half years since then I've had a lot of guilt over those last few years of her life and believing that if I had somehow been a better daughter to her that she would still be here, as well as guilt over that in the years since she's died I've become a very healthy happy person that she should have been able to see grow up.

fxksdxks [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and there is a direct correlation with how I dress depending on my mood cycle. When manic I am overly concerned with how I dress and will spend hours getting ready and making sure I look ABSOLUTELY perfect. I feel good and I look good. When depressed it's comfy and cozy all the way. Even if I wanted to put together an outfit I couldn't, my sense of style just leaves me.

jillerski [info] Recognize that speaking in absolutes always places you into an antagonized perception of yourself. Don't feel that you're dumb for doing so because I still struggle with that tendency myself. I would advise you to take a moment and acknowledge your feelings and break them down to their root causes. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder several years ago and there's times where I simply have to acknowledge that the root of my depressive episodes were simply biological. But I also recognized that I do have control of how I react to it. Instead of writing off my life as a permanent and hopeless end, I acknowledged that yes I am experiencing a bad cycle (term used for long depressive episodes) and I also acknowledged that this cycle was temporary and that really was key in helping me cope. When you're in the desert dehydrated, a simple drop of water feels better than nothing. Keep at it and don't speak in absolutes. Always address your feelings in the present tense but never as your absolute outcome.  [info] None [info] 1548721029
ignoremypresence [info] Explaining your past So I’ve been with my girlfriend for almost 2 years and things are going great. We love each other deeply and she’s aware of my bipolar and all that it entails. The beginning of our relationship was incredibly rocky, I had just gotten sober after years of alcohol abuse and at the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar and began medications. Needless to say, I was a dick. But she stuck through it. The problem I’m facing is not only managing my ups and downs, but the events of my past coming back and hurting us. It started initially when I failed to mention that I had had sex with an acquaintance of hers who she who she was interacting with due to her mutual friend groups. Similar situations like these would happen on occasion but the most recent one was I was discussing with a friend of hers, who too is bipolar, about the manic and unprotected sex I had before I met her. I’m clean, that’s not the issue. She’s explained that the issue isn’t the actions themselves, but the fact that she has to hear them through others. It doesn’t help that we went to college together and we have a lot of mutual friends. So the problem I’m facing is basically how do I explain to her that I’m not trying to hide anything from my past, but it’s just that there’s so much and it never occurs to me to bring it up. I love her, and she loves me, and we’re planning on getting married but she doesn’t want to be hearing about my past through the grape vine. At the same time I feel uncomfortable talking about everything I’ve done in my past before I cleaned myself up, it’s embarrassing and it isn’t who I am anymore. Do I just sit down with her and tell her everything, no matter how uncomfortable? What have you guys done?This is just a mini long rant and just curious if anyone has similar situations.

TheSausageTurd [info] I agree to a point. I use it both recreationally and medically. I was diagnosed with bipolar 5-6 years back. They put me on a concoction of medications saying it would help. These included but not limited to prozac, lithium, and Xanax (not all at one time but when one didn't work they would give me another one). Most of the medications did get rid of the extreme mood swings but completely took away my personality. I started smoking weed over a year ago and I will never go back on prescription mood stabilizers. While weed does has it's downsides including not being able to drive or work it allows me to be myself and keeps me in a good mood for the entire day. I've tried CBD gummies and whatnot but they don't seem to have the same effect for me. It could be placebo but whatever it is weed truly is a hell of a medication but it should be used responsibly.

Trillibub [info] I'm not attacking you, but you sure went all-out defensive.  Many bipolar people experience exactly what you listed, and those things are not generally considered functional. If you meant to say that they're functional with medication, you should realize how different that is and possibly correct it. Since you want to puff chests and bring it up, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for almost three years. I've been hospitalized and gone to support groups where I've met many like me. It's been hell, and I'm often only functional *with the right cocktail of meds.* As are many who are diagnosed. It's not some mentality or way of thinking; if the whole world was as depressed as some of us have been, there'd be far fewer people alive today. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1461708646
Kratom4Fibro [info] I have been afraid to quit for many years now. 10 year kratom user, but it turned out to be much easier than expected! I've read so many horror stories about quitting kratom, I was actually very wary about it.  Like my name says, I was treating fibro with kratom, and it literally gave me my life back for the last decade.  Recently however, I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1, kind of shocked me, but also made a lot of sense.  I resolved to give my meds a real go and quit the cannabis I also enjoyed after work and on the weekends.  I took the kratom still at my usual amounts for the first three weeks of treatment, not wanting to dump everything at once.  But it was really looking like my pain was in fact due to my mental illness.  Usual kratom use for me was 3-4 times a day at less than 2g per scoop.  I haven't weighed for years, but never hit 2g when I checked my usual spoon's worth once in a while, and it worked very well for my pain and energy.  When I first cut back, I simply went to once a day.  I meant to do a better taper, but found no difficulty in just forgetting to take a second dose.  I did this for three days, intending to do a week, then cut my scoop in half, then see how I felt.  But I had a bad reaction to one of my new meds, (and no it has nothing to do with quitting kratom, I can assure you all) and on the fourth day I realized at bedtime that I hadn't taken my lunchtime kratom and just went with it.  I didn't feel a damn thing the next day besides what I was dealing with from my meds, which is not related to any quitting kratom symptom I've ever read about.  So I just kept going with it.  After two weeks with no kratom, I assume I am free of it entirely, and it was a cake walk.  So I can support what I've read many times from healthy people, don't abuse yourself with kratom, and kratom won't hurt you.  Stop chasing what it can't give, don't seek perfect pain relief, take what it gives you, a tolerable reduction.  Don't fucking starve yourself in the hopes that it will be "better", it won't.  And don't blame it because you wanted to hurt yourself with a substance and chose kratom. [info] None [info] 1557439201

frangipani_c [info] I'm 02/08/1981 (2nd August 1981).Completing my specialisation as an anaesthetist in Australia.  I love my job and feel blessed to be able to make a living doing something I love.Undergraduate Medical Science (Honours) degree and then my MBBS.Have had my first dog (as an adult) for nearly a year now.  He is a 2yr old staffy kelpie cross who I rescued from a shelter.  I'm so happy to have him in my life :) .I live on the opposite side of the country to my family.  I moved here with my ex and I haven't left.  Been here for 10yrs now.  I miss my family very much but we also have our issues, so sometimes the distance is good.  I speak to my mum nearly every day.  I have a strained relationship with my older sister that improved somewhat when she had my niece.  I adore my niece and am sad that I am not a part of her day-to-day life.  I have a younger brother who I speak to maybe once a week or fortnight, but when we talk, we really talk.  We understand each other very well.I am in a fairly new relationship (less than a year) with a lovely guy who really loves me and I think I am falling for him.  My main hang up is that I am still in love with my first love.  We were together from the age of 18 to 29.  We were each other's first relationship.  We were engaged to be married and inseparable.  Then I had a depressive mental breakdown in my final year of med school and became extremely self destructive.  Excessive drinking lead to black out drunk episodes which lead to an infidelity at a med school party whilst my partner was away with work.  Whilst drunk, someone I thought was my friend (who was 'looking after me whilst drunk') kissed me and I initially kissed him back.  I ended up pushing the 'friend' away once I realised what was happening and drove home drunk.  I confessed to my partner and after a time, he forgave me.  However, my self destruction just got worse as I then started to doubt that I truly loved my partner if I had put myself in a position where I was unfaithful.  Yet, I did love him, but I couldn't resolve the internal conflict of what I had done ... so I somehow convinced myself that I didn't do anything wrong.  This then led to a spiral of deceit and further infidelity, and eventually to the loss of my partner, loss of my reputation, and loss of many friends.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my manic episodes coincided with my infidelities.  I truly had no insight at the time that what I was doing was wrong.  I had days where I would barely sleep or eat but I felt incredibly energetic and daring.  I drank excessively during those episodes and didn't care what I did or who I did it with - I honestly thought I could do no wrong.  Those few months altered the course of my life catastrophically.  I managed to complete med school and have since created a new life for myself, but I now have very few friends and I'm scared to get close to people for fear of losing them.  The loss of my ex and of so many mutual friends devastated me and I just don't have the strength to go through anything like that again. I have travelled all around Australia quite a few times and have travelled overseas to New Zealand, Indonesia, Thailand, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Spain and London.  I'm hoping to travel much more.I don't have any kids and due to the demands of my career, my creeping age, and my history of mental health disorder, I'm not sure whether I will and/or want to have children.  Being a doctor just makes me even more aware of the risks of my advancing age and of the risks of a relapse of my bipolar.  Overall I have a pretty great life.  Yet losing myself and therefore my ex will always be my life's biggest regret.  I am now a strong advocate of seeking help for mental health problems early and not buying into fear and stigma that stopping me reaching for help when I first needed it.

quix27 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar after having one manic episode brought on by situational factors. Luckily I was able to ditch the meds they tried to give me while continuing to see my psychologist at the time and worked through the trauma that had caused the manic episode.Something to consider, do you feel like your mood swings are random or situational based? I think if they are situational, then drugs may not be all that effective. If you feel like you are taking drugs that aren't helping you (and especially if they are hurting you), you should probably talk to a professional about it. I have a lot of people doubting me too. Especially because my discovery of ASD (and the likelihood that I am on the spectrum) is still really new. Being an adult female is particularly difficult to diagnose, but hopefully that will change as more research is done. [info] None [info] 1446588961

In here it seems people have the same problems as I, rumination and obsession, getting lost in parallel worlds where things could have happened differently.I'm not saying it's bunk, but it's something I'm going to think harder of for sure. Maybe my mood swings are just a part of my personality rather than a mental disorder...In the end, I guess whatever makes you happy. If the bipolar treatment helps you/me handle difficult emotions and mood swings, then awesome! I do not like feeling out of control. And I want to like myself. [info] None [info] 1470112224
lexcanon [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar about a year ago, and was prescribed lithium. I took it for a while, but it never felt right to me because personally it felt like a shortcut. I’m sure that a lot of lives have been saved because of medicine, even lithium in particular. I’m not trying to say that everyone should be like me or anything. I’m just saying that I felt like taking medicine or trying to find medicine that will “fix” me was like .. someone else doing my homework. Sure, it gets done, but now the whole point of it is moot because I didn’t learn anything, or grow as a person. I’m spiritual which has a lot to do with it, but I chose to give up the shortcuts and work very very hard to have my moods be self manageable. And it worked! I’m more content than I’ve ever been and I know how to let my low moods come and go without attaching to them. I made this decision right after seeing a video of middle aged woman whose organs were failing after having been in lithium for so long. If medicine were the solution to my problem, it wouldn’t create more problems. I’m glad that I was confident enough in myself to go against the advice of my doctors... who never even had a chance to know what I was capable of without them. [info] None [info] 1536765109

shmeeks [info] Insight/advice about transferring credit card balances Hi friends! So most of our debt is from credit cards.  I have student loans, but my husband doesn't have any so that's a plus.  I accrued the credit card debt because I was very young and misdiagnosed with the wrong mental illness and spent way beyond my means.  About three years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on the right meds and I am very stable now with my spending under much better control.Anyway, we have a better handle on money and we are slowly chipping away at what's now our debt.  Someone at work told me about transferring credit card balances to a new credit card that has 0% interest upon opening, that way you are paying off principal as opposed to paying off principal plus interest.  Then once your 0% interest period is over you do the whole process over again with a new credit card.  Also, you then have a credit card that is now "paid off" so to speak, that is open to any emergencies.  To me this sounds like a good idea, as we currently do not have an emergency credit card, which I believe we should as we have 3 dogs, two of which are older and health issues are more at risk.  Also, I feel like the transferred balance would be paid off faster.Haven't researched this as much and haven't really found the pros and cons about doing this so that's why I'm reaching out on here--to hear from anyone who's done this successfully.  Does this affect your credit much?  I feel like opening so many credit cards would negatively affect your credit, but I don't know.  I appreciate anything anyone has to offer on this subject! Thanks in advance! [info] None [info] 1572307128

wannabeomniglot [info] Between my first read and my first reread, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.My entire perspective has really changed - Cersei, whom I hated, I now feel an odd kinship with. I see her arc as less ruthless and more tragic; in her I see a woman helpless against her own delusions, at the whim of her uncontrollable lust for vengeance and power and love.Arya, whom I loved unconditionally (and still do), I now see as much more pathological. I feel like in order to deal with the trauma she has endured, she has decided to be perpetually in motion, and I'm very concerned about what will happen when she stops moving forward.Depression, which is half of what I struggle with, is occasionally described as a grieving disorder. With that in mind, I have come to connect with Robert Baratheon, whom I saw as a philandering asshole completely out of touch with the reality of governance and an entirely self-centered worldview. I now see him as somewhat powerless in the only ways that matter. I am much more sympathetic to his perpetual grief now than I was before.This was probably quite influenced by the show, but I went from loving Petyr Baelish as a crafty mastermind, to being really disgusted as I watch him take advantage of the weak and the principled.

The only times in my life I've been seriously happy were when I was 5 years old playing nintendo, when I was 13 smoking marijuana, when I was 17 when my ex was in love with me. I'm just literally always on the edge of having a mental breakdown and I have one every day. I have no friends and I talk to no one. My family always brushes me off and I just feel like I'm crazy and I need my ex back in my life, for him to call me and talk/laugh with me.

I just lie in bed crying and feeling like I'm paralyzed, like I cannot do anything to fix anything. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD. I don't believe I have bipolar, I actually think I probably have borderline personality disorder like my mom. Whatever you can label my problems, I really just have no control over my emotions and I'm a very emotional mess with bad mood swings.

405sucks [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012 and I’ve been through many unstable relationships that included self harm, abuse, suicide attempts, manic spending / infidelity, the list of shitty things I’ve done to my partners because of my bipolar goes on.  Only after going on Lamictal in late 2016 did my relationships begin to show improvements/stability.  However, I did date a girl with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and I gotta tell you that BPD puts bipolar in its rear-view mirror.  If you think this sub is depressing, head on to /r/bpdlovedones and check it out.  At least as a bipolar patient, you’re still manageable under medication. You can (to some extent) recognize your symptoms or episodes by monitoring your sleep or your spending habits, sex drive, etc.Bipolar disorder is a manageable mental disability compared to what’s out there, so don’t give yourself a hard time. That being said, it’s still a disorder which brings instability. My advice is to respect the boundaries your SO sets for you. Take your meds, sleep well and you’ll be better than 90% of bipolar patients out there.  [info] None [info] 1549772113
pellowmelk [info] Seroquel + Adzenys...? Need thoughts Hi guys,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 yesterday as well as ADHD. My doctor recommended a 50 mg dose of seroquel at night to stabilize moods, waiting a week to see how that sits, and then starting Adzenys for the ADHD. I took my first dose of seroquel last night and woke up feeling absolutely TERRIBLE. I was incredibly drowsy and confused, and just generally feeling like my brain was made out of cotton. It's evened out a little bit since then but I'm still sitting at work feeling dumb and even more unable to focus than usual.I know I probably just need to keep taking the seroquel and getting my body used to it, but I also really need to be able to work and get things done. My question is... if I wake up tomorrow feeling like I did this morning, do you think it'd be a bad idea to try the adzenys to see if it can help counteract the brain fog? I feel like the amphetamine would help snap me out of it, but maybe I'm just playing with fire by trying to do too much too soon. What do you think?While we're at it, anyone want to share their experiences with seroquel and adzenys? [info] None [info] 1497559407

That was over a year ago and I've had some symptoms, but they're getting much worse. Everyone keeps saying "But you're on meds." when I express concern. My family seems to think I take magic pills which make me normal and happy. Does this happen to anyone else?

DexterMorgan67 [info] As a teen, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but we kind of chalked it up to hormones and I was mostly fine. I know some of my behaviors are reflective of the disorder though, but the last time I was on medication I grew lethargic, gained over 100 lbs, and did actually try to commit suicide. However, that was over 10 years ago, and in my early teen's (14-15). I probably should work on seeing a therapist, but I'm taking 14 credit hours, work ~50 hours/week, and work out five times/week.

BabyGirlR [info] (23/F) 3-4 severe mystery headaches a day. INFO: 23, Female, 235LB, 5'4. Caucasian. Diagnosed bipolar disorder I, PTSD, only allergy is nickle, suspected gluten-sensitivity. TMJ. PCOS.Medications: Lithium 300mg, Latuda 40mg, Lamictal 200mg, Gabapentin 600Mg all at night and Ativan .5MG as needed. Heavy ibuprofen usage.  Melatonin before bed.Other; Nexplanon birth control implant. I drink roughly 250-600MG of caffeine a day in the form of energy drinks.I started getting headaches back in late September and taking ibuprofen to help get rid of the pain. It would always work. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD so I am on a *lot* of medication to help manage those symptoms.  The headaches started at once or twice a week and progressively got worse. The last two months have been terrible as they've not only shifted from happening every day to multiple times a day. One a scale from 1-10, they average about a 4 but grow quickly if I do not take something for them. They almost always come back in a few hours and have become more resistant to ibuprofen. They are entirely resistant to Tylenol.  Sometimes I have to take 1600 (800, wait an hour. 800 again) to make them go away and that doesn't always work.  They mostly happen while I am up and moving around at work or in public.I drink a lot of water. I have a healthy diet. I am unable to exercise right now as activity seems to trigger them or make them worse. Sunlight and bright lights tend to trigger them. Yesterday I drove against the sun and ended up sobbing in my car because a 3.5 headaches turned into an 8. I couldn't drive and I was VERY nauseous.   Stress triggers them. Eating anything like bread or pasta, or even eating the meat off a sandwich triggers them. Caffeine helps but only for a little while. I have tried hot packs and cold packs, both have mixed results but cold seems more successful. I have tried antibiotics, sinus rinses, and decongestant medication with very little change. I HAVE gone to my doctor about this and she was completely baffled by the headaches and told me to just keep taking ibuprofen and watch what I ate. She must've asked me 50 questions and told me she wasn't sure what was triggering them but because of my medication, she couldn't give me anything. I asked if it was safe for me to take ibuprofen at this rate and she said it was fine as long as I ate when I took them. I'm taking 4 200mg tablets a time at least three-five times a day. She tested me for allergies and nothing came up food wise, but she said gluten might trigger them. I agree with that statement since I've tested eating pasta and some bread and gotten a NASTY headache every time. She doesn't think it's a brain tumor or anything like that.   She ran a lot of blood tests (like, 25 vials worth of blood) and didn't find anything that was off aside from having low estrogen and confirmed I'm healthy. The headaches almost always come with nausea. They feel like they're mostly in my upper forehead and the top of my head. I have a lot of problems sleeping as well. I wake up a minimum of three times a night and have been doing that *every* night for months. I practice healthy sleeping habits and even take melatonin to help me sleep but I still wake up. I'm at a loss of what to do, I even got new glasses thinking that the headaches might be triggered by that.  I had Nexplanon put in early February and while they definitely got worse after that, I was still having them before that.  I'm not sure what to do but living like this is inhumane and makes it impossible for me to function. Any advice is appreciated. Where do I go from here? [info] None [info] 1583507649

alliengineer [info] I am also a victim of CSA. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was a teenager and struggling to cope with what happened to me. I was put on medication for 11 years. As an adult I started to go to therapy and I realized I did not have bipolar disorder. The medication was simply keeping my feelings under control and it was unhealthy for me. It took me a very long time to wean off the medicine in a healthy way because my body was addicted and I realize my brain and body will have lasting effects from taking the medication while I was developing. As an adult and not on medication (after about 4 years of therapy) I think my brain has healed quite a bit. I still suffer highs and lows but I feel much more normal now, and I continue to go to therapy when I need it. I don't know if you have bipolar disorder or not but I am telling you that you are not alone, and to really give therapy a shot with a psychologist. My mom had originally sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was diagnose me and prescribe medication without actually helping.  Take care.  &amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1539018865

RellyTM [info] I think I'm falling out of love with my boyfriend. Please help. Hi. Thank you in advance for any constructive comments. I am 20f, my boyfriend is 24m. We've been together officially for almost a year and seeing each other for a year and a half. I have loved him from the very beginning. I wasn't always head over heels but I was always really fond of him from the second I saw him. I left for school after the summer and we couldn't stand being apart so we've been living together for the past year or so.Yesterday I woke up feeling a little different about him. It was like I fell out of love with him overnight. I was scared and confused and I kept analyzing and telling myself I still loved him but I guess I didn't really believe it myself. This morning I woke up and felt it again... I couldn't stop smiling when I saw him... it was love all over again... but this evening I'm questioning it once again. I'm terrified of breaking up with him, not because I'm scared of him or anything like that, but because I was so sure he was my perfect guy. He's my superman and the love of my life, and I don't know what to do.The only thing I can think of that could be happening is that I'm becoming depressed again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very young and about two months ago I started becoming lax with my meds. I probably have taken them 2-3 times in the past three weeks. I thought I was fine but maybe it's starting to numb my emotions. The last thing I want is to fall out of love with him and lose the first wonderful relationship that I've felt truly secure in.tl;dr: I'm afraid I'm falling out of love with my boyfriend, but I'm also bipolar and I've stopped taking my meds so maybe I'm starting to become numb.

DearyDairy [info] Likewise in Australia,  once you have a diagnosis a lot of specialists and treatment services are free or heavily subsidised,  but if you're over 18 the process required to get a diagnosis can be expensive,  if your GP doesn't think you're mentally unwell then you can't access subsidised psychology. When I was a teenager I had a diagnosis from my psychologist,  bipolar psychosis.  My mother and I believed thus was incorrect,  and that I actually had PMDD,  it took many years and a few thousand dollars from our wallet to see the specialists needed to make that diagnosis,  in the meantime most experts agreed with the bipolar diagnosis and reassured us that the reason I wasn't getting better with bipolar treatments was because bipolar is very hard to manage. When I found a psychiatrist and endocrinologist who believed it was PMDD and got me started on HRT,  all of my symptoms resolved within a week. Completely. During the year when I was diagnosed with bipolar but chasing a PMDD diagnosis,  I won't lie,  I told people I had PMDD even though at that point it was a self diagnosis. The fact is that my self diagnosis was later supported by specialists and getting it looked at professionally allowed me access to effective treatment so it could stop disabling me and ruining my life. Taking my suspicions from self diagnosed from actual diagnosis was the only option for me in terms of living my life properly. Yes,  getting the right professional care is difficult for a lot of people,  access is difficult because the nature of the disease prevents normal social ventures like going out and getting help. But you can't claim that you suffer if you're openly choosing to remain self diagnosed and not looking into how to get a clinical diagnosis. In Australia headspace can consult you via Skype, cam, talk or text. You can talk to a therapist while taking a shit!Our system is not ideal,  people slip though and get missed all the time.  It's mostly because their illness is such that they don't want care or require so much care that short of a full time personal mental health nurse,  they will just bounce around in the system or fall out of the system completely.  I see it a lot,  but these people who fall through are not the same people as the timblrinas who complain.  [info] None [info] 1457415014

Medical bills are expensive.Then they drove me two hours away in handcuffs after i said i would comply with everything, had me involuntarily committed to a mental ward even though I did everything i was asked, meaning i would need a doctors note to leave instead of being able to check myself out after 72 hours.I was malnourished and didn't eat a vegetable for two days because they messed up my order.

BaltsDeep [info] This is actually the reason I smoke.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 7 years old, and spent the years from 7-23 heavily medicated.  In the process I became hypothyroid, went from slim and on a swim team to a morbidly obese compulsive eater whose metabolism was basically switched off by anti-depressants.  When I was 14 I decided that I wanted to have such a level of self-control that I could stop myself from going into a manic rage.  Didn't start smoking until I was 21, and I instantly found that it was a substitute for just about every medication I was on.  Feeling stressed/manic?  Take a puff and level out.  Feeling depressed/anxious?  Take a puff and level out.  At 23 I stopped the last of my medication cold turkey, a mood stabillizer.  And at the time I wasn't really smoking much because I had become a dad and didn't want to smoke around my child.  But I found very quickly that moderation is key.  A quick puff before I go into work makes my fuse 30x longer.  A bowl after a hard day when I'm feeling depressed helps me see the light that paints my life, not just the darkness.  And aside from the ever-looming possibility of a random drug test at work, there are no side-effects that cause it to even come close to what those prescription pills did to me.  I'm healthier than I've ever been, weigh what I did as a fat 8th grader, and love my life.  Big pharma be damned, this herb is a lifesaver! [info] None [info] 1483649849
Zero132132 [info] Not the same disease, but I had a similar experience when I was a young'un. I was diagnosed with bipolar at a very young age, and during manic episodes, I often would be awake for days at a time. My manic phases often COULD include a violent component if I got a bit too excited. They put me on lithium when I was still in middle school. The lethal dose and the effective dose are close enough that they had to run blood tests pretty often to make sure I was taking the right amount. The lithium itself made me feel like absolute shit, and drained me of all energy. Everyone else seemed to think that was a good thing.Not the same, obviously, but excluding the surgeries to remove necrotic tissue, I see the outline of a familiar experience that not many others understand. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1549376818

I just don’t get it though, I mean I can see how the therapist came to his diagnosis, because even I can clearly tell the drastic changes in my mood and behavior. But couldn’t it be possible that I’ve gone through, and still am in some ways, the worst pain I have ever had to experience. And trust me when I say I’ve spent almost my entire life living as a human punching bag for scumbags dressed like little red riding hood or Prince Charming, and my hearts just to naive to see a the villain underneath their disguise.

cigsxcoffee [info] Does obsession have something to do with my bipolar 2 disorder? I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last November. I'm not taking meds for it, because the psychiatrists wanted to confine me in a hospital. I didn't think my mental health was that bad, so I refused to be confined, and that meant she wouldn't give me the meds.Fast forward to now, community quarantine. I am working from home but I still got plenty time on my hands. I've been watching the series Feel Good on Netflix, and I developed an intense obsession with the lead actor, Mae Martin. So intense that I would send her messages every day on all her social media accounts. I tweet her and when she likes my tweets, I'm on a good mood all day, but when she doesn't, I'm on awfully bad mood. She turned off her DMs just now so I can't send her messages anymore, and that really devastated me.I actually have a real life girlfriend and I don't think my obsession with Mae Martin is ruining my real life relationship. I just don't like this feeling of being intensely heartbroken for someone who doesn't even know me, and someone who will surely never get to meet me. It's affecting my focus already, and I feel like I'm trying to compensate it by messaging my girlfriend more than usual.What's happening? Is the quarantine doing this to me? Does this have something to do with my bipolar? Please help. [info] None [info] 1586133614

Sanwi [info] Trouble falling asleep due to intrusive thoughts I have been diagnosed with bipolar and ADD.

Normally these kinds of thoughts help me be productive and creative, but when it's time to sleep, they don't stop. The worst part is that I enjoy these thoughts normally; when I'm working on a project, being obsessive actually helps me get it done. So when I need to stop, I really don't want to, because it's enjoyable.When it's 4 am, and I can't stop thinking about computer code, it gets pretty frustrating.

beast-freak [info] Wellbutrin and Tinnitus [x-post: r/bipolarreddit]I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have also been dealing with tinnitus most of my life. After trying a variety of antidepressants the doctor prescribed Wellbutrin.I have been very happy with Wellbutrin thus far. I have however noticed my tinnitus is rapidly getting worse. Both a [Google search] (http://www.google.com/search?q=Tinnitus+Wellbutrin) and cursitory browse of r/tinnitus suggest there is some anecdotal evidence the drug can be in some instances be ototoxic. Obviously, if true, this is a concern.I am desperate to get my life back but aggravating my tinnitus (or  trashing my hearing) would be an extremely steep sacrifice — even at current levels the ringing is  virtually unbearable Another option, iis to find a medication that protects hearing — does such a medication or supplement exist? if anyone has information on non-ototoxic antidepressants that would also be of help.I am in New Zealand so trying to find more exotic antidepressants is difficult. Obviously I will consult with my doctor but any suggestions, words of advice would be appreciated. Edit: Heading off to bed now. Will reply to any responses tomorrow. [info] None [info] 1503488124
ShortFantasyChick [info] Complete loss of motivation, help? I've been severely depressed for nearly 2 years now, but in the last 2 months I've completely lost the last shreds of any motivation.

I'm so fucking sick and tired of doctors. I don't have time to make my body a drug disposal for shit I don't need.

prefontaine250 [info] What should the role of drugs be in our life? I feel incredibly conflicted.Almost a year ago (last winter) I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after being held on a 5150. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they told me if I ever drank or did drugs I'd end up back in the psych ward.Many doctors I met (particularly the female ones, I don't know why) spoke to me in a condescending tone, as if I was subhuman and bound to mental illness. When I was released from the hospital they drugged me with  high doses Zyprexa and Lithium. Taking the meds made me drowsy all the time, I lost my sex drive and endangered my relationship. The anti-bipolar meds were ruining my grades and my life. So I decided to stop taking them. No issues. Things actually got better. I switched to a much cooler psychiatrist. He said it was ok if I drink alcohol but I should avoid marijuana. He also thinks I have ADHD (he emphasized nothing can be known for certain in psychiatry) and gave me adderall which helps me study. I am thankful for that. The only problem is that I feel incredibly depressed. Weed was the thing that made me more relaxed and allowed me to enjoy life.So I don't know where to find a balance.  So much conflicting information that I don't think can be answered rationally or scientifically. Any thoughts? [info] None [info] 1411936085

DylsWorld [info] I saw a psychologist for about two years after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I of course talked about how I smoked from time to time and the benefits and also side effects it caused me at the time. The one thing he never did was tell me to do it more or tell me to do it less/not at all. He left the decision up to me, and instead asked me questions and provoked my thoughts as to why I used it. I think this is the most important thing a good psychologist should do. A good psychologist should help YOU find out why YOU do the things you do. Psychologists aren't magical wizards. They do not know everything there is to know, they are just humans like the rest of us. The best psychologists don't inflict their personal beliefs onto their clients, they help their clients come to terms with their own beliefs. I think for her to give you an ultimatum like that is silly and if I were you I would switch to a different psychologist.  [info] None [info] 1420409349

CoffeeCrazedMom [info] My thoughts are just my experience.I used to break things and I still have those urges. It's just that my son is very important to me so I'm trying to act right tho I do fail from to time.I think around the time my son was a year old I was thinking I had bpd as well. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and also pmdd. I talked to some friends and they said my current med (lithium) was effective for both bipolar 2 and bpd so it was my choice if I wanted to go in to see a doctor or not.In hind sight I'm thinking maybe it was more hormonal than anything. I went through a bit of PPD and from what I read that can start even after a year post partum. I breast fed for 9 months so that could have had something to do with it too.Or it may have been that I started back up on lithium after breast feeding and weaned off again because I didn't like the weight gain (dumb I know).I haven't broken anything in over a year and my son is 2.5 now.

SciFucker [info] Can you have Bipolar and BPD? Hey guys! I just wanted to know if anyone on this subreddit has both Bipolar and Borderline Personality Disorder dual diagnoses? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year and a half ago, and I've never fully resonated with my disorder. When I first saw my psych, I thought I was experiencing symptoms of BPD (based on what I gathered from online sources and what my friends observed in my behaviour) but he determined that it was Bipolar. But I don't know if I really am Bipolar, or at least solely Bipolar, because my hypomanic states don't last more than a day or two days and a lot of my switches from elevated moods to depressed moods, and vice versa, are triggered by situations in my life or incidences in my relationships with others. I've done quite a few of those online quizzes (and I totally understand that they're not a replacement for an actual psych visit) but I got moderate to severe scores for both Bipolar and BPD. If anyone has any advice that would be much appreciated! Thank you! [info] None [info] 1586298287

troylatroy [info] So I think I need to get a second, third, fourth opinion. I don't know where to start. I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 11 and I was medicated from then to about 17. Mainly on anti psychotics because anti depressants make me more suicidal. I'm 31 now but I think I need to be medicated. I just don't know where to start. I might be miss diagnosed. I kinda think that I might be schizophrenic or BPD, or something resembling those traits. I'm at a loss. I therapist but I couldn't open up completely to her. I need help but I can't find it. I'm sick of making people feel bad when I talk to them about this. [info] needs to stay off ebay [info] 1551536408
BigTrain2000 [info] What Makes Someone an Empath? Am I One? I'm not a fervent believer in the paranormal. For example: I believe there are ghosts, I believe there are also demons and angels, all three by the Christian God's design. I consider Wiccans to simply be passionate lovers of nature, and don't believe in Karma. My logic is cool and collected, while my emotions are wild and unbridled. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder, and several psychiatrists have mentioned I have many qualities of an individual with borderline personality disorder. One psychiatrist told me to read up on "The Gifted Child," a book which details how individuals who endured abuse as children had to become hyper-tuned to the emotions of others as a survival skill (the abuser's momentarily raised eyebrow may indicate a beating later; the abuser's calm, shallow breathing may mean no food for a week.) I noticed I have many of these qualities, in regards to being hyper-tuned to emotions. So, what makes an empath? I think I may be one, but in the terms that I can sense other's hidden emotions and physically feel their emotions wth them. Not by any paranormal means. [info] None [info] 1485293831

iMainLucina [info] My (18 F) friends (18 M, 18 M), best friend (18 F) and ex boyfriend (18 M) left me DISCLAIMER: I hope you don't judge me for this because this is the first time I'll really open up, and I'm scared. I have a really bad temper and when it comes to group works, I really explode. I often lash out to my friends whenever something bad happens or something doesn't go my way. The two friends were my research group mates and I exploded to them twice, saying that the second time, I was so agitated because I saw a corpse that was hung at our parish church. As for the best friend and boyfriend, I lost them at the same time because I also lashed out on our social science group. My ex's best friend, who was my group mate, was doing all the work and I felt like there was no communication, so I got really angry and tried to rant to my boyfriend but he couldn't take it and asked the best friend if it were true. We've had the same problems over and over again, but there was a time when he realized he just couldn't accept how I am. He tried his best to change, but I didn't, so we ended up parting ways. I still think about him, though, and my dreams are always full of him and his friends. I remember all the good times and it hurts that I was so immature it caused 4 important people in my life to leave me. My best friend doesn't even talk to me anymore, apart from discussing requirements. She told me a week after the social science incident that I had to change and she gave me a list of things to remember by, but I have very bad memory, so all I could remember was to leave my ex for good because he couldn't give me my needs (I have very low EQ and I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and adhd). I tried messaging her, but she wouldn't even seenzone me. To add, she also told me to change during the three times I did that to her, but I just couldn't. As for my ex, I did it to him more than 10 times probably in the duration of our almost 2-year relationship and he says I never change so he doesn't want to interact or anything. It's the first time I ever felt so chronically sad for weeks and it's also our time to graduate already. I got so crazy I cut my hair yesterday, but I don't think anything changed in my outlook in life. I flooded my best friend in a lighter way than I would flood my ex, but that's still bad. I know I'm an awful person and it takes time to heal the wounds I caused, but I don't know how to change. I would appreciate if you guys could give me tips because I am also very impatient and it just breaks my heart that I lost 4 important people in my life to my attitude. They were putting up with me for the longest time, and I just can't believe that they've had enough. I honestly have been like this ever since I can remember because of the way my family brought me up (e.g. slapping, spanking with a belt, verbal abuse, kneeling down with books at my hands to teach me a lesson). I tried to fix my relationship with my parents, but I can't help but blame them for my mindset. I really think I haven't healed from my childhood and there's no way of healing because I still live with them, and I'm envious of how other people could have space from me, but I can't have space from them. I'll give it to them though. They really tried to change, but I don't know how to heal. I don't know how to change myself so that I won't lose any more people. I don't know how to healthily cope with all the break ups I have had and how to win them back somehow in the future. Because, in all honesty, I loved all 4 of them in different ways, but they were all staples in my life. Sometimes, I think of ending my life so that I wouldn't be a bother or hurt as much anymore because I lost important people in my life, but that's a different thing from what I'm asking. I'm also very afraid that they cut me off for good and I can never regain the beautiful friendship or relationship we once had. I really do desperately want to change, and I know the first step is acknowledging those problems, but I've been in step one for 5 years and I don't know what to do. Should I isolate myself so that I wouldn't be able to lose any more friends? Should I keep talking to my other friends about my sadness? I don't have much to do and I'm an extrovert and I just don't know how to proceed with this. Tl;dr I have really bad temper that is probably caused by my upbringing which led me to lash out on the people I care about the most. I lost 4 of the most important people in my life, and I don't know how to gain their trust back. I also don't know what to do to change so that I would stop losing any more friends.

Detonato [info] Had to quit my loves again I had 2 seperate psychosis episodes before I was diagnosed with bipolar, one was in private and one was more public. The fear of having another psychosis episode which were 2 or so hour long frantic hours of insanity became my greatest fear. I quit smoking weed and drinking for close to 2 years because I was convinced that's how the insanity manifested as both happened while I was high. Fast forward to a time where I felt stable after living to a regime of my pills and mental health, I decided to start using pot again. At first it was fine but if I ever started to feel "too high" I felt like I was no longer in control of my stability and would be convinced I was slipping into a psychosis episode. This goes on for months and everytime I got high I felt like I was playing Russian roulette. I made the call to quit weed again and decided to stick to drinking, but this week after having a few extra beers I started to feel those fears I had of losing control or slipping into a psychosis rear it's head. Today I've sworn off alcohol and doubled down on no more thc for me..Tl;Dr weed and alcohol give me panic attacks bc of my fear of a psychosis episode happening again [info] None [info] 1561960070
cryptid_critter [info] I definitely have a complicated relationship with emotions. When u was in high school my dad went into a bipolar psychosis that ruined my life. He treated to kill us, my school almost had to honor knockdown because they thought genes going to come to try to kill my brother and I. My parents divorced. Later that year I was diagnosed with bipolar. I remained resilient in my ability to master my emotions, and to not tip too far like my dad did. I feel, I feel a lot and I feel very very strongly. It's very easy to make me cry or make me red-faced and I hate it about myself. I am so afraid of feeling anything too strongly. When I do express my emotions I always feel like everything I do is too much. I feel like I'm annoying everyone around me. I had feelings of gender dysphoria throughout high school, even though I didn't realize that's what it was. At least, I think that's what it was. I wanted to be Eli Goldsworthy from degrassi (ugh lmao) Acting like him, acting masculine, made me feel SO GOOD. it felt right, I felt like me. But then it would feel so good that it felt fake? So I would stop. This feeling persisted, in college I wanted to act and emulate Tyler Durden from Fight Club. I loved feeling like a punky badass DUDE. But it makes me /too/ happy? Like I feel SO STRONGLY when I act like that, and it freaks me out and triggers my desire to suppress my emotions really really hard so I shut down and convince myself I don't like feeling that way, or that I'm fucked up for wrong for wanting to be that way.

Haven't been in a low point since diagnosis, probably on the back of all the support I've gotten from my family and friends but I feel like I'm due for one soon and wanted some advice.

ChocolateMeoww [info] I [21M] want to ask my coworker [21F] out, but the place we work at has us working opposing schedules. How can I do it? For a bit of context: We both work at a residential support home, which means that there's literally only one worker working at a time, except during shift-changes. The way the scheduling works, is that we all have our set of hours, and it's all but impossible to see her. She works a completely different set of hours than I do.Now, with that being said, I was working a weekend shift a couple of weeks ago that I normally don't do, and I was coming in as she was supposed to leave. She ended up clocking out and talking with me for quite a while, and I could tell that she liked me. (Obvious cues like her staying a lot later than normal, touching her hair and neck, looking deeply into my eyes, seeming interested in me, etc.)But now it has been a couple weeks, and we really haven't seen each other in a while. We had an employee meeting last week, but I was feeling a particular bad depressive episode (I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II). During the meeting I was able to get some "clues" about her, in the sense that I did that age old yawning trick to see if she yawned back because she was looking at me. Five out of seven attempts ended up with her yawning shortly after I did. We also made eye contact a several times during it. I'm fairly confident that she likes me.Anyways, what would be a good way to ask her out? I technically have her number because we have an employee directory and every employee is *expected* to have every other employee's number just in case. However, that just feels "creepy" since she didn't technically *give* her number to me. I did say that "If she needed anything, my number is in the [office]." as I was leaving after we met. As much as I hate society's gender roles, I realize that it's pretty much up to me to make the first attempt. Actually, every single approach that I've ever done was with me making the attempt. I honestly don't think I've *ever* been hit on, but I digress...---**TL;DR** I want to ask a coworker out, but since we never see each other due to opposing schedules, it'll be extremely difficult to do it in person. I'm fairly sure that she likes me, and is single. I'm wondering how, if it's possible, could I ask her out without being overly "creepy." *P.S. sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

just-one-more-blush [info] A meditation on erratic spending during a manic episode. While I consider myself a huge advocate for people with bipolar disorder types 1 and 2, I would be remiss if I didn't say that many of the stereotypes of the disorder manifest in many (not all!) patients. Specifically, and most related to this sub, would be the erratic spending that  can occur with manic behavior. As with any symptom, active management is a necessity to work towards stability even during turbulent times, but sometimes this isn't enough to curb all possible outcomes.As a disclaimer, this is all anecdotal and reflects a recent event in my life. If you are struggling, please pursue help in any way, big or small. I have found resources through the NAMI (Nat'l Alliance on Mental Illness) help line: 800-950-NAMI, including local sources of help, and would recommend calling in.Here's a little background on bipolar disorder. Surprise! There's two sub types. First, there's type 1, which features both manic and depressive episodes. Mania varies for each person --or even each episode--and may include what I went through. How one handles mania is nearly as varying. I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2, which features a lovely little thing called hypomania that we can get into later, though due to an extremely stressful (dare I say traumatic? it's a dirty word on reddit these days) event I had a manic break-- the first since my diagnosis and the first that I did not self-medicate with alcohol. Upon learning that I was going through this, it was time to ride the train until the end, no matter what the outcome.On to the fun part: Manic spending. **Feeling good is fleeting.** Feeling good feels nice. Feeling good is the goal. Feeling good is a different, at times frightening, objective when the world is swirling at irrational speeds and the mind is pulled apart in impossible directions, moving from euphoria to exhaustion during the course of an episode. It's the moments of feel good that pressed pause on my whirlwind of sleeplessness and blind ambition that lasted for weeks; as this storm raged on with no sign of slowing I needed feel good moments. Desperately. Longingly. Though, as always, fleetingly.**Purchasing makeup became my ultimate crutch.** The period of research slowed my brain down, as I studied what I wanted and what I thought I needed, and this brought the feel good up into the back of my throat, begging to burst into my consciousness. First it was a fast-paced dance in a Makeup Geek cart, after following a brief discussion of duochrome shadows on this sub. After obtaining a coveted medium-sized MUFE metal palette (perhaps during the onset of this episode) I wanted to fill it out, to make it a sassy reflection of my personal taste in shades that would not appear in conventional arenas. I mean, they're *so* cheap, never mind that I had drunkenly purchased 6 MAC shadows not weeks before. At most I had settled on another 6 MUG pans. I eventually bought two shadows and a blush.**Starting small: Another UD Revolution Lipstick** which prompted a purchase from Macy's as a mother's day gift (Kate Spade earrings, none the less, because I saw brand over quality at this point and was unaware that I had lost control of myself). No harm, right? Why not grab 2 more Inglot shadows, as I fell so in love with them before?**I set my sights high and binged on the big one: Marc Jacobs Style Eye Con No. 7 "The Dreamer."** Between a beautiful collection of shimmering peach, vibrant yellow golds, and creamy champagnes it is clear that I objectively did not need this. I searched /r/makeupexchange endlessly, asking a seller if she still had it, before relegating myself to ebay. A reseller shipped it to me for $40--what a deal!--and I basked in the glow and poured over swatches, building looks in my mind and dreaming of the sleek, black packaging.**The MUE seller still had the Lolita palette, I jumped on it.** This had lit up my eye previously, though never enough to draw the yearning I felt for The Dreamer. Of course, for $40, I bought this too. Being far less familiar with the palette itself I dove headfirst into its color and design, immersing myself in the shades and letting my desire for this palette build.**Makeup wasn't the only crutch.** I kept buying, nabbing gifts for my sweet and immensely tolerant boyfriend, whose heart was breaking as he watched me spinning like a top, unable to do anything but wait for it to stop. During a day home from work, as I was physically unable to do so at points, I ventured out through the city to small, adorable shops in my area, collecting Mother's Day gifts for others, buying a beautiful necklace for a girl that I was not obligated to purchase a birthday present for. Jesus christ I ate the most gigantic plate of nachos in Milwaukee. Shouts to Mr. Senor's, the city's premier vaginally-themed walk up taco shop. Hell, I gained ten pounds. Welcome to life without sleep and olanzepine, a hell of a medication I was prescribed (after signing a waiver and a physical examination of my heart's condition) because my shrink knew moments of lucidity in a psych ward would lead to an early checkout and unnecessary blows to the egos of doctors and staff. **I knew what I was doing was wrong. So wrong.** I cowered in fear of checking my bank account and still have yet to see what I had done. There's still cash in there, but the lost portion could have gone toward savings or travel or anything more practical than more makeup. I knew I had zero need for any of this but knowing it was manic spending gave me a "pass" to let loose. I mean, it's better than the alternatives, right? It's less harmful than binge drinking, right? It's inconsequential, right?**I am better now** and full of regret. Oozing with regret--why else would I write this elaborate post?--and cannot believe what I had done. Of course returns weren't possible with most of my purchases, and if they were they were more hassle than they are worth--trying to use the products to their fullest in the meantime. I cannot deny that I bought within my tastes and will enjoy my impulses as if they were more calculated purchases, but they remain a reminder that I completely lost my shit. The strong, collected, controlled bipolar disaster. Lost. Her. Shit. So much so that I have left those around me terrified that this will happen again. Imagine a puppet, dancing for hours on end as the pads of its little wood feet lose their lacquer, becoming dull and eventually splintering, collapsing, as the puppet still dances out of control. This is what my mania looked like, and now I'm the puppet, sitting here with my own strings limp in my hands, feet bandaged and still bleeding. Thing is, this is still leagues better than a bipolar type 2 depressive episode. **I hold the belief that everybody could stand a visit with a therapist, if only to have an impartial ally for distressing and even banal thoughts. If you are struggling with overspending, a calm voice to talk to you about the deeper problem beyond makeup is worth a thousand Sweet Peach palettes. **Thanks for taking in my long, extremely personal story.

But we will also talk through serious things through messaging too.I have mental health problems and before the diagnosis I had was questioned (Sept last year), I had a very bad depressive episode towards the end of July, which lasted throughout August and into February of this year. Very confusing.Anyway, on August 5th last year, I was feeling very low and had decided to take my own life that night, which was a Saturday, so he was at his mums an hours drive away. I had tried calling him and my family and no one had picked up.He had fallen asleep and had woken up at 11:30pm and saw the missed calls. I was sat there, about to carry out the act (no further info will be given on this, so no methods or mention to what I would have done). He didn't know if I would be awake or not and didn't want to wake me of I had fallen asleep, I'd been awake for nearly 4 solid days with no sleep at this point and he hoped I was sleeping.He sent me a message apologising for missing the calls and asked if everything was OK. I couldn't think of anything to say and any way of lying was lost to me at this point, so I simply replied back saying "no" and he tried calling me. I felt completely ashamed about what I was going to do and what I would be leaving him to come home to. I couldn't bear to talk to him on the phone. So I kept rejecting the calls and I was eventually able to get a message over saying I'd talk on WhatsApp.We then went through absolutely everything that had gone one over past few months (which we now know was hypomania, I was diagnosed with bipolar). We spoke about what I was going to be doing and about why I was doing it (an even longer story than this, sorry for this story). For about 6 hours we both sat up and spoke about everything. Not just about how I felt, but also him too.So, yes, we do reach out through messages too, and by doing that, it saved my life.I hope everything is OK on your end. I'm sorry this reply was so long.

neptuneslut [info] Idiopathic Hypersomnia &amp; Bipolar 2 disorder hello! I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder at 18 and have just been diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia last december at 24 years old. I had to get off my bipolar medications (Trileptal &amp; Zoloft) in order to start taking Nuvigil for the sleep diagnosis. for the most part i’m doing okay dealing with both issues however when I DO have any mood swings they are much more extreme then they had been since I no longer take medication for it.just curious if anybody has advice as far as managing the two together?? feeling stressed as it seems no matter how I try to take care of myself I cant fix every problem at the same time. one diagnosis has to take priority to the other and it feels very overwhelming [info] None [info] 1572493357
cakecakepiecake [info] MIL and baby clothes A few months ago I went through my daughter’s baby clothes, getting everything sorted to donate. It was an emotional process for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar and it’s not a good idea for me to have another baby until I’m more stable. We also aren’t in the best financial situation. We were sorting through the clothes, picking out a couple sentimental outfits to keep. MIL didn’t want us to donate the clothing. She wanted us to save them for when SIL’s kids. SIL is not married, but is engaged. She also isn’t interested in having kids anytime soon. And there’s no guarantee she’d have a girl. We hung onto the clothes in case any of our friends became pregnant. But the only couple we knew are expecting a boy, so our hand me downs aren’t useful to them. I was so pissed. First MIL wanted me to give wedding decorations (that I ended up not having) for SIL’s wedding. Now she wanted me to save baby clothes for SIL’s baby that might never happen. She’s so desperate for a grandchild from her daughter, despite having a grandchild from her son. [info] None [info] 1526935567

bkrandomz [info] If you're not hypomanic/manic are you in a depressed state? Hey guys I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychotic symptoms. They say I'm possibly schizoaffective.I ended up in a hospital when I was manic because I never had an immense feeling like I did in my head. I thought I was going go die and that everyone was out to get me, even in the hospital. I was in an inpatient program for almost 3 weeks which was like hell for me.Now I'm at home and I'm on 15mg zyprexa and 1.25g depakote. I turned to caffeine and ecigs because I felt hypomanic at times and needed something to stimulate my mind.Now I don't have that hypomanic feeling and I crave caffeine because I feel so tired and depressed. Is this because I'm now in a depressed state because my mania/hypomania has ended?Thanks [info] None [info] 1435239570

runningonfumes121 [info] I've heard it's hard but so many people I've seen online say it's worth it so much so try and stick to it. I thought I had all the symptoms of bdp for a while minus the dissociation but when I was diagnosed with bipolar it made a lot more sense when I learned that there was multiple types. Even if I did have bdp, I'm not sure anyone would diagnose it in me (my therapist laughed when I mentioned it) since it's so stigmatized. I don't have any form of ptsd so I can't offer my perspectives on that, sorry. I guess all I can say is to stick with the DBT and hopefully it'll treat your symptoms so that it really doesn't matter if you have either or both.  [info] None [info] 1519653568

More than anything, I would like to confide in my best friend that I pushed away a long time ago, because I miss them and they didn't deserve that. I have a feeling there's a certain etiquette to letting someone in on the condition of your mental health (and probably the sooner the better) but I just haven't figured out a way to tell them without coming across as *wanting* to be a victim.

littlebirdhouses [info] My mom has bpd and I am worried I might as well. Tdlr are my behaviors learned from my mother or do I have the same disorder?I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd. my mom has boarderline personality disorder. She ruins all of her relationships, I'm terrified I actually have it too. I have alot of similar coping strategies as her, and for my first relationship I didnt recognize it untill we broke up. I dont know if it's because I grew up with her or I actually have it. I literally tortured my ex the same way she tortured me and I had no idea untill later. I fucking hate that I didnt see it sooner. I cared about him too much if that makes sense. Like way too much. I have alot of issues that I can trace back to things my mom would force me into or things that happened as a kid and I have never been diagnosed or had my doctors even bring it up before,  I am really worried that because of how I was with my ex that means I am. I have made every effort to recognize my actions with him, and I really dont forsee myself ever getting so attached to anyone else again. I ruined my relationship with him the same way my mom ruined every relationship shes ever had. She has one friend and she lives across the country. My brother hates her because she treats me badly and guilted him untill he cries. She basically spent years emotionally torturing him for not seeing her more often, he was a little kid and everytime he saw his mom he was made to feel like shit or see his big sister get treated like shit, when it was entirely out of his control. He would do something my mom deemed rude, or made her upset, I had to take him aside and talk to him or "discipline " him. I basically just explained why she was mad and he would get upset at her and ask why shes so crazy. When he was upset or hurt he came to me, and it got to a point where my mom was mad at me because my brother liked me more, and didnt want to be around her as much as me. I think it's just because he respects me more. Mom now blames me for it, and says I made him hate her. She usually pulls that card out on my birthday. She blames me for her entire family hating her, she says I lied to them and made them think bad things about her. But they have kindof hated her since I was little. My aunt is the one who initially got my brother and I taken away.My whole family thinks shes an addict, because she acts so erratic and hysterical that it seems like shes on drugs. When she feels threatened she flips. Theres no way for her to ever be the bad guy in any situation. She is volatile, everything is a huge screaming blow up. She will literally just forget an entire situation if she has to. Her brain just can accept it.My first boyfriend and at the time I was having alot going on and my mom had isolated me and the only people I saw for years were my mom and my boyfriend. He and I were teenagers when he moved in. I never attached like that to anyone but him before except my mom when I was little because I was taken away alot. He and I had absolutely no boundries, and spent all of our time together. I thought we just were really close, I had never been in a healthy relationship or seen one. If it wasnt for him living here I'd believe my mom, by the end of every fight she would have me thinking it really was my fault. When he was there he saw and heard everything. He absolutley hated my mother for how she was with me. Roght before he moved out he told me not let her torture me anymore.I genuinely believed we would be together forever, I trusted him completely. It took me a good few months to really get over him but I'm okay with it now. I was completely freaking out because I hadnt been eating or sleeping and i was working really hard and doing alot of physically strenuous work. my brain fuses kinda blew, basically like went through a really bad really long manic episode. I'm lucky I wasnt with someone who gave a fuck about me because I would have been hospitalized but my best friend at the time enjoys watching people spiral. I was really dependent on him just with everything. We had a super toxic relationship on both ends. I didnt know how I was acting untill I was able to see it from the outside, and was able to live around people who act logical. I'm terrified of becoming like my mother. She tortures people, she makes peoples lives hell and in turn makes her own life hell. I find that most of my relationships platonic or otherwise are with very negative influences or just kindof bad people in general. I all have made friends with the dick head kids because I always found ways to excuse bad behavior, or find reasons why they are good. I hate seeing people sad, and I hate being the cause of it. I'm also super insecure, and I'm terrified of what people think of me, because if they think I am on drugs I could have my kids taken away, if I am ugly people will make fun of me, if I mess up at work they will think I'm stupid and might fire me. I dont know if I'm paranoid or what, but the last thing on earth I want is to be like my mother. [info] None [info] 1580549047
Silent_Sibyl [info] I went through school to become a funeral director. Graduated summa cum laude and loved every part of the education. Once I got a job at a funeral home, I lasted three months. It didn’t help that the owner was a chauvinistic asshole, but what really got to me was that I had to constantly walk on eggshells. Even answering the phone  with “good morning” set some people off. It’s been six years since I left that job and the field, and I wish I could say I’m doing much better and that I’m happy, but I’m really not. At the very least, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 last year, so now I have an excuse why I couldn’t handle the job emotionally.  [info] None [info] 1552942243

I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for about two years now, and have been taking mood stabilizers for quite a few months now. I'm doing better than ever. I'm able to actually keep up with my schoolwork, I've been making better and more thought-out decisions, I cry less and smile more, but I can't help but miss being all over the place. Even though my lows made me want to die, a weird part of me wants to experience them still. It's like I've romanticized the idea of them. Same with my mania. I miss being the crazy-impulsive and fun version of me who felt everything so deeply.

Dadofrocky [info] 401K question I'm 49 male and my STBX is 38 female. We've been separated for almost 3 months.  I had been unhappy in my marriage for a while, and while having a minor disagreement I told my wife I was seeing a counselor through my employer.  She freaked out and said she couldn't handle things and left. She called about an hour later and asked me to leave our home so she could come back, since I had family in the area I could stay with and she didn't. Being a nice guy, I agreed and left. That was the last time I've been inside my house.My wife sent a separation agreement within a week of this happening. She asked for the house with no compensation for me. I knew I needed a lawyer (she had used one to prepare the separation agreement, and we have a fair amount of assets to divide) since she had one, so I asked around and found one (at more expense than I was really anticipating).We've agreed to some terms in the separation agreement. I had initially said I didn't want any of her 401k, and that is what I'm going back and forth on now. She has about $350K vs. my $100K.I'm considering asking for just enough of the 401k to pay my attorneys. I'm basically giving her everything else she wanted (after she pays me half the equity in the home). I'm in North Carolina. Does anyone know how much of her 401k I might be entitled to? She built the entire amount during the marriage (11 years) while my retirement accounts were established about 8 years prior to our marriage. She makes quite a bit more money than me but I'm not looking for ongoing spousal support or anything like that.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder right after we separated and have been in ongoing treatment since then. She is upset that while we were married I had started talking to other women online. I never cheated although she believes I did. I've since learned one of the most common manifestations of BPD is impulsive sexual behavior. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have done any of this in my right mind.We only communicate through attorneys at this point, so talking to her about it is really out of the question.

autonomous_foxfire [info] I think it would make sense for him to be caught off guard by me responding positively to his compliment if it happened once or twice. However, it happened at least a few times we would see each other in person. This happened once or twice a week (we live about an hour and a half away from each other). Him and I had a lot of issues dealing with communication, and I don’t think I am out of line for shifting that blame to him. The relationships prior to the one with him, I did struggle to communicate my feelings and problems. I never wanted to step on any feet or create waves for the other person. Going into that relationship I laid everything out for him, I was an open book. If there was an issue I would bring it to his attention so we could work on it. If something was bothering me I would confide in him.  I opened up about my past, a history of abuse and mental illness. It started with my mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder four years ago. I had told him in great detail how that was for me. He would start by making passive aggressive comments here and there about my diagnosis. Then followed hours of cryptic texts. He would allude to something being wrong but refused to explain what had been bothering him. It became a stressful guessing game. He had told me that he knows I am going to cheat on him because he read somewhere that it was “impossible” for someone with bipolar to remain faithful. It was only a matter of time. It seemed fine when we together in person. At least it felt fine at first. When we would talk about more in depth subjects and beliefs he would question my understanding but phrase it in a “nice” way. Like it was “cute” that I thought I understood the topics. He would ask me loaded questions about my ideals, personal beliefs, and personal experiences. I could feel that I had to really think about how to answer these questions because if I remotely eluded to something that would upset him I knew he would use it against me. There is a long list of experiences with him that felt like he wanted us to be doomed. It was one dragged out conversation after another that kept planting thoughts in my head that he never wanted this to happen to begin with. One of the things that bothered me the most was when he asked me what traits are important to me. I told him I value loyalty, autonomy, honesty, and sincerity. He responded by telling me he thought I was vain and fickle. I hope this sort of explains why I feel his response seemed more calculated. It felt like each new day was a new chance for him to test me and see how far I could be pushed before I broke. It felt like the beginning of a very toxic, abusive relationship. I think if he had come into my life when I was younger, I would be in a worse situation right now.  [info] None [info] 1509638400
kattbug989 [info] 20.I was very musically proficient in high school. It earned me a shot at a statewide recognized concerto spot (i was a finalist), a professional gig in a community band, and a whole bunch of miscellaneous prestige as a high schooler. When i got to college, i got a combined $36,000 scholarship due in part to that talent. I ultimately gave it up/simply couldn’t handle college in my mental state. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a hospital stay that caused me to drop out. I’m starting from scratch at a community college, still unsure of what I want to do. I would say my biggest accomplishment is getting through these two years of hell. I went from an apartment i simply couldn’t afford (i was working 26 hours a week with an unemployed boyfriend), using drugs to cope, and having mental break down after breakdown... to a steady full time job, paying for college classes for the summer out of pocket, and a wedding date on the horizon. I’m currently moving into a 2 bedroom apartment with my fiancé and our best friend, and i couldn’t be happier. My job is good, there’s money in the bank, food on the table, and none of those drugs in sight (aside from my bipolar meds, which are also part of my accomplishment).

Before I was diagnosed with bipolar ll I was on an antidepressant that put me in a hypomanic state for about a year until I went off of it. I was super productive when I wasn't overwhelmingly anxious haha. During all that time I had a lot of tics, they weren't involuntary but I felt a lot of discomfort if I didn't do them. Thing like sniffing/inhaling through my nose, blinking hard a certain way, often one eye at a time, etc. Now I'm diagnosed and am on Lamictal and I'm having the same tics again! It's really bothering me and the sniffing and eye strain are really starting to give me headaches, plus I feel like a crazy person when I can't help do them in front of people lol.

MrB0mbastic [info] I've thought there wasn't any difference between a person with aspergers and a normal person, and I even have a sneaking suspicion that there isn't much difference in any mentally ill person and a normal person. I was once a pretty uncontrolled person but I've been getting better, I recently got off my meds and feel much better since I did. I was diagnosed with bipolar and getting off meds is supposed to be the last thing I should be able too do. I feel better and they say I shouldn't. I have no way to back this up but I'm certain that the brain is just the hardware that we write our thoughts on is the software. And I feel just like how a computer can get a few important drivers become corrupted, same goes with the brain. If a child is told that small talk means people don't like them and no one corrects it and if that small child grows to adult hood then there is going to be huge holes in their experiences with other people. and I've been thinking about this for a long ass time. It's like some people think that is someone is so stupid to never figure out that small talk is fun and leads to good things then they must be stupid, but in reality all it takes to never learn that is a hateful parent or one that is too controlling. lots of things can cause that and no one seems to get that. They just try to say it's some sort of genetic bullshit.The truth is no one needs any pill for an emotional problem, the truth is they need someone to care about them. Sad too say it but the idea that pills can fix anything has caused way more harm then good. Pills for mental health is going to be the death of mankind if we don't stop it.

I even got a 60 and 80mg increase and it was amazing.But then something happened. I just feel like I'm not invited to anything. I'm in a frat and I'm not in one 'special' group chat with anyone. I hang around with people but I'm not invited to a single fucking thing. I just kinda invite myself everywhere and I hate myself for it. It hurts knowing I'm always the odd one out and I feel like I'm worthless in that regard. I feel like I'm kinda extroverted at times, so I get energy talking to people, but I can't seem to ever enter conversations with other people. After a party I was at that was an open invite tonight, I realized how awkward I felt, so I left crying on the way home. There I took my razor and just started cutting my leg. So yeah, here I am after 14 months. [info] None [info] 1568435408
Funkingthefake [info] Okay, there is no cure. But that doesn't mean your life is ruined.I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  There isn't a cure for that, either.  But I take medication, I've had a lot of therapy, and I'm constantly building tools so that I can manage it, so that I can be a functional person, both to myself and others.  People with OCD go through a similar process. [info] None [info] 1436083608
megapizzapocalypse [info] About my dad So throughout my childhood my dad would scream at and intimidate me and my brothers, make misogynistic comments to put me down (once I was a teenager) and would constantly tell me and my brothers that whatever we did, it wasn't good enough. I always had to go back and do it again (chores, schoolwork, music practice).  When I left for college things seemed to get worse. After I graduated and was living at home looking for work, it seemed like we had weekly screaming fights. At one point he threatened to kill me then a day later gaslit me and denied ever saying anything.   About two years ago he decided on his own to start going to therapy. As far as I know no one pushed him into it. I had already moved out at that point and was seriously considering no contact / very low contact but was held back by the fact that I wanted to stay in contact with my mum and brothers. I wasn't aware he was in therapy until one day I was visiting and he told me he wanted to talk to me about something. We sat in my parents' living room and he explained his worldview as he had worked it out in therapy, how he sees any "outsider" as an enemy and only cares about "insiders" (me, my brothers and my mum). He said that as me and my brothers became adults he was often very confused about whether we were "insiders" or "outsiders". He said that his worldview was a result of his upbringing and he was trying to change. Throughout the whole conversation I was in fight or flight mode and kept looking at the door. He said he didn't think an apology would be enough. I asked him for one anyway and he said, "I'm so sorry". After about a year of seeing that he was keeping his temper, not putting people down I slowly started to feel more comfortable around him. I still don't hug him or touch him but I'm not afraid of him any more. I started to make small talk and casual conversation over the phone and when I visited, where I had previously avoided him to the point of not staying in the same room with him. Around this time I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my parents were very concerned about me and supportive of me getting treatment. Talking openly about my mental health made me more comfortable and trusting around them.Recently, over the last several months, I have become comfortable enough to talk about my childhood with him. We had three separate conversations that I think had a big impact on both of us. The first time, I mentioned that his temper tantrums had made me afraid when I was a child. This was big news to him (why?? we were ducking and flinching and running out of the room) and he seemed very shocked. He said he hadn't realized what type of impact he was having. I think he apologized but I don't remember the wording as this was a little while ago.  On a second occasion I used the word "abuse" during a conversation about my childhood and he cried. It was surreal. He said he thought he had done better than his parents. He talked a little bit about how his need for control had affected the way he acted and how he is learning to recognize those thoughts and not act on them through therapy.Most recently I had the courage to bring up some of the negative comments he used to make about my body. Even thinking about the comments makes me feel disgusted and ashamed so it was the hardest conversation we've had. He was again very shocked to learn what impact he had had on me. I told him his comments made me feel "gross and disgusted with myself" and he put his head in his hands and stayed that way for about ten minutes. Maybe it's wrong but there was a part of me at that moment that was like, "Yes! Suffer for what you did!". He said he was sorry for how he acted and that he wasn't going to try to excuse it. He said he was trying to understand how I felt when I felt disgusted. I don't think he's made the connection that his behavior was due to a specific pattern of toxic thinking (misogyny) in the same way that he made the connection about his need for control. I am hopeful that he will eventually realize with the help of his therapist.    Maybe I'm naive but I'm hopeful that this is real change and he will keep making improvements, even if it is gradual. If you see red flags that I'm missing let me know.   Thank you for reading this far I appreciate you xo&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1551194788
kaiocant89 [info] When I was diagnosed with bipolar in the mental health clinic I was staying in they kept me in a bit longer when I started taking the mood stabiliser lamictal because of the small but not insignificant risk of kidney failure.  I was a little overweight at the time and I was fine.  ALR’s diet and weight would be hard enough on her kidneys as it is, if a psychiatrist did diagnose her with bipolar and wanted her on medication they would probably recommend inpatient stay so she can be monitored, here in Australia anyway.

montilyetsss [info] Thank you so much. Dealing with mental illness is so hard, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I, so being without my medication is hard and it causes my stress to go up and my emotions are even more heightened, it’s really hard but I’m hoping to find a psychiatrist hopefully this month so I get back on my meds and be in a more healthier place mentally before I start. It’s rough dealing with mental health issues but I’m trying. I’m really determined, despite the meltdowns, crying fits, anger fits I always said I’m going to college on way or the other I don’t care what it takes. I know everything is going to be okay!

11Y1N [info] Struggling... help! I’m 5 years clean, heroin being my DOC, but I haven’t been sober. I occasionally drink and sometimes smoke weed. I was diagnosed with bipolar type one about 6 months ago, and I’ve been struggling with managing my sobriety since a recent(ish) med change and concussion. These happened around the same time. I switched from one mood stabilizer to another to prevent further weight gain. The first stuff was good other than gaining weight. I felt happy and was outgoing and talkative. The second stuff just isn’t doing it. I feel dependent on meds now, and since this second med isn’t creating this artificial happiness I feel like I’m self medicating with the stuff that does (weed and sometimes alcohol). I’m worried about my behavior. I impulsively bought a pint of whiskey and a 6 pack of margaritas. I smoked before work and then couldn’t go in because I was too high- and then lied to my wife about all that. I’m going off the rails I believe and I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. How do I explain my relapse concern when it’s not a full blown binge but just as impulsive?

the_LloydBraun_ [info] Oh my god. I've never known how to explain the high periods I go through. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 and then told I was misdiagnosed by another mental health professional. I kept asking, "but how do you explain these periods of 'hypomanic' behavior?" They said I was just "happy" and that that was the "real" me. That always seemed off and I never felt like it fit. THIS fits. I had no idea this was even a thing. [info] None [info] 1575043821
CaptainSteelmeat69 [info] **Recently single people, read this:**About a year and a half ago my ex left me for someone else and I was diagnosed with bipolar II around the same time. These two events set off a chain reaction of addiction, abuse, brief homelessness, joblessness, and overall a shitty life situation. I was left legitimately wondering if I had any purpose in life or if I should just end it.It's been a rough 18-20 months, but my boss (at a job that I love) asked me today if I wanted to move to full-time during the summer, I went on a date with a wonderful girl and we're meeting up tomorrow, and I registered for classes in the fall.When you're recently single, it can feel like nobody wants you, or that you're not of value without your other. I can tell you that, after many months of undoing a lifetime of self-hatred and learning to know my own value, that is a load of bullshit. You are worth more than what you'll ever know to a whole magnitude of people. Life gets better, you just have to stick with the lows to appreciate the highs.This came out unusually sappy and new-age-y, but you get my point.

Abood1917 [info] thanks for responding. I was diagnosed with bipolar (not sure if 1 or 2, but I’ve had psychosis so can that pin it down?). Anyways I called my psychiatrist today and mentioned to him that I feel like I have bipolar because of the mania or hypomania, not sure which one, that I had prior to my psychotic break. I’ve only experienced delusions, no hallucinations at all. Even when I did LSD last week I experienced delusions for 2 days cuz I didn’t sleep and when I slept everything went away and realized I was nuts lmao.Have you had any experience with adderall for adult ADD/ADHD, smoking weed, and/or psychedelics?

TheVampiricOne [info] nMother Denied Me From Getting Mental Health Treatment It seems I finally found a place where I can express how I grew up. I have a nMother. She has a severe drinking problem. Bad enough that she would fall out of her wheelchair (used because of neurapathy, now she just uses a cane) and she would shit on the floor. I took care of her through her cancer treatments and neuropathy that came from the treatments. I finally got the courage to move out a year ago when she was more independent and I was finally 18. The last straw was her breaking my nose and calling me a selfish bitch (for the 100th time). Here's a list of what she has done that has hurt me to this day:-Denied me mental health treatment while I was suicidal and self-harming (even after calls from the school)-Made my father's death all about her, even though she divorced him-Turns everything I talk to her about into something about her- I'm a firm believer she is a reason why I've been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder-She treats me like an awful person because I don't want to see her, but she hardly treats me like a person-Has made fun of me for seeking my own mental health treatment I understand she has had cancer and has a lot of trouble after the fact, but taking out everything on the people you claim to love is not the way to express your feelings.

theboolk [info] Friend is pissed at me Background info: I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1, and I drink a lot and do a lot of drugs. I am also on medication.So last night my friend was going to come over (she does drugs too). She and her boyfriend both came over. She wanted to talk about some problems she has been having (real bad ones). She specifically asked me to be sober. I was coming down off a shitload of clonazepam and a little bit of gabapentin. I was almost sober and she was an hour and a half away so I knew I was good. I didn't drink anything until she got to my place.Once she got there she said it was fine if I had a FEW glasses of wine (she wanted to talk not party). I had 2 and a half glasses of wine, the booze mixed with the come-down of the gaba and klonopin. It got me SUPER fucked.I sat on the bed and passed out. I did not know that was going to happen. I genuinely was going to stay sober last night so we could talk.She left with her boyfriend after I passed out. She is pissed at me. She told me she was hurt (which hurts me, I hate to see others in pain or hurt).I was just wondering what your guys' opinion on this was. What you think I should do etc.This whole thing is making me more depressed (my meds are being adjusted and I'm in a BAD depressive part of my disorder). I've been nervous and having panic attacks thinking I hurt and lost a friend. Its just killing me inside. Edit: this is like my BEST friend too. We are like family.Edit: please don't tell me "stop using drugs or drinking". I just want advice for my friend.UPDATE: So I just talked to my friend on the phone. I apologized and I'll probably see her in a few days. [info] None [info] 1504533056
Excelsior5050 [info] Reply to Tinnedlightsy and Cannedbetsy Thank you very much for taking the time to respond to my long post and to give it your thoughts.Pmo stands for porn masturbation and orgasm. I'm a Pmo addict for 18 years. Let's put my cousins encounter on the side for a sec. I wasnt defending ny heterosexuality in the post. Im just trying to understand what caused me to experiment with guys. What were the triggers since I'm not physically nor emotionally attracted to guys not back then not now. I've always had girlfriends. So there is a trigger for everything in life, cause and effect, action and reaction.Did I also mention that in 2008 I was diagnosed with bipolar and by mid 2009 I was recovered. I'm sorry that my case is very complex. Because when bipolar hits I do things out of hypomania or mania that I'm not aware. So that could be a trigger plus acting out on my Pmo addiction sexually fantasies. And now we could add my cousin's encounter from childhood as the trigger to all this. At my core I think I'm very sexual and my lust drives me to do anything to get off. I'm posting here my thoughts because I noticed many similar posts so I know I'm not alone and I can benefit from your feedbacks and opinions. When I Do it with girls I experience complete harmony and feel natural and have completely satisfying orgasms.  When I do it with guys I feel disgusted unnatural and shame.For example, I was with a girl yesterday and we had a long sexual encounter more like all night haha and when I came I felt fulfilled and completely in balance. Few hours later I remembered the encounters I had with guys and the shame came back to cripple me.Finally, and therefore I don't know how to restore my heterosexual image back. At my core I just want to love and be loved by a girl. Yet the things I did with guys messed my self integrity. Now I find myself stuck!Any thoughts on this? Anybody with similar stories? Thank you very much for your time. [info] None [info] 1466423421

hamburguesa_ [info] Positive Paragard / Copper IUD experience (Day 1 - Day 28) I kept a journal on my experience with the copper IUD so that I could share the experience with others. The post will recount the day of the procedure as well as my first period post-IUD.&amp;#x200B;**Background**I was very hesitate on getting on birth control (BC) since I hadn't been on it for 5 years. I tried various methods (pill, patch, shot, hormonal IUD). My last experience with BC was the hormonal IUD (Mirena). I was tired of taking a pill every day so I decided to get Mirena. My experience was AWFUL, from insertion to side-effects. The insertion was one of the most physically painful things I have been through. Then I had acne, hair-loss, tooth-decay (perfect dental record before Mirena) and spotting as side-effects. After about two months, I had it removed and told myself I would never get back on BC.Five years pass, I start a relationship with someone and I decide it is probably for the best that I get on BC since neither of us is ready to have children. I knew I did not want to go down the hormonal route because, in the past year, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I am on a med regimen that works for me and I did not want anything affecting that since my brain feels so normal now. My only option is the copper IUD (Paragard). Seeing as I had an absolutely awful experience with my previous IUD, I was REALLY hesitant. I also use a menstrual cup and have heard horror stories about the cup pulling the IUD out. I spoke about all these concerns with my doctor and she reassured me that my experience with the copper would not be the same as with the hormonal.&amp;#x200B;**Day 1 - Insertion**I was prescribed 200mg of Misoprostol to take orally the night before. I read a lot of mixed reviews about this. Some people said it helped, some said it didn't. Research showed that it can have side effects of nausea, cramps and diarrhea which could make insertion worse. I contemplated taking it. Eventually, I decided not to since I went through with the Mirena IUD insertion without taking Misoprostol 5 years ago.I was also prescribed 800mg of Ibuprofen and 1mg of Xanax to take an hour before insertion. I took both as prescribed.I was feeling super anxious / depressed about doing this since I had a horrible / painful experience with the Mirena insertion. The doctor talked me through everything while in the room. She also dimmed the lights to make the room more calming. She used an ultrasound machine to see how large my uterus was and to verify that the IUD could be properly placed with no issues which I found super reassuring. Soon enough I started to feel calm about it all (the Xanax was also probably taking affect).I felt a few contractions but the pain was much more bearable compared to what I felt when I got the Mirena inserted. Quick comparison of the conditions during insertions:||**Mirena**|**Paragard**||:-|:-|:-||**Age of insertion**|22|28||**Pre-insertion meds**|None|800mg Ibuprofen, 1mg Xanax, both taken 1 hour before insertion||**Time within menstruation cycle**|2nd day, heavy flow|End of period, first day of no blood||**Insertion method**|No extra tools to help with insertion|Ultrasound used to help with insertion / placement||**Pain scale**|8/10|5/10|After the procedure was done, I laid down for a bit and hysterically laughed / cried because the doctor gave me a picture of the ultrasound of my "baby" which I found funny despite the pain I was feeling. I then walked with my partner to the car and felt a mild ache. He drove us home since I was Xanned out.When I got home, I placed a heating pad on my lower abdomen and the mild cramps subsided.7 hours after insertion, I had sex with my partner. There was no pain. It was as if I didn't even get the insertion done earlier that day.**Day 2**Minor cramps but nothing to impede with my day. Considered taking ibuprofen. Minor spotting. Only used one liner.**Day 3**No cramps. Minor spotting. Only used one liner. Worked out (HIIT) with no issues. Had sex with no issues.**Day 5**Spotting ceased.**Day 17**Started spotting again with mild cramps (almost unnoticeable). 6 days away from predicted period.**Day 20**Decided to switch from a liner to my cup since spotting seemed to be a bit heavier. 3 days away from predicted period.**Day 21**Cramps more consistent so as a precaution took 400mg of Ibuprofen. Turns out I don't think I really needed it. I think my period has started so logging it in my tracker as the start. 2 days away from predicted.**Day 23**Today is the predicted start of my period but I think it started 2 days ago. My cup has been leaking but not due to it overflowing. I think my IUD strings are preventing a full seal. Leak is mild and inconsistent so I wore a liner and that sufficed. Trying to learn how to properly put my cup in without interacting with the strings since I'm worried about IUD expulsion.**Day 28**Period seems to have ended on day my tracker predicted it would (5 days after start of period). The following day I had mild spotting but that ended yesterday. Had sex last night with no signs of blood. Went to the bathroom this morning and still no signs of blood.&amp;#x200B;**Period before IUD**1st day heavy, extreme cramping. I typically take a lot of medicine and use a heating pad. Empty cup twice / day.2nd day heavy, no cramps. Empty cup twice / day.3rd and 4th day light to done. Empty cup once / day.**1st** **Period after IUD**4 days of spotting leading up to my period. Very mild cramping. Wore liner.5 days of consistent, moderate flow. 1st day mild cramping followed by no cramps rest of the days. Empty cup once / day.1 day of spotting after end of period. Wore liner.&amp;#x200B;**TL;DR**Overall, I love my copper IUD! Insertion was bearable. Pain 5/10. When my period came around I had 4 days of spotting, followed by 5 days of a consistent flow, followed by 1 more day of spotting (totaling to 10 days of blood). Cramps were mild. Sex and exercise feel great (nothing changed in that aspect). [info] None [info] 1564072164

DeviPotato [info] Setting the Record Straight - An Open Letter Dear Reddit Brony community,There have been rumors going around about me. That I'm some kind of psychopath, or rapist, or a murderer, or I've done something illegal, or something. I don't know the specifics, because I don't care to. All I want to say about this is that these rumors hurt, especially coming from a community I personally associate with "love" and "tolerance" and all of those elements of harmony. It especially hurts because the source of the rumors has been someone I once called a friend. Someone who I went out of my way to be there for in times of need. It hurts.I'm here to set the record straight, nothing more. So here's the story.During the first week of April, I experienced my first Manic Episode. For anyone who is unfamiliar, read up on Bipolar Disorder. Manic episodes do weird things, but ultimately it causes the person who's bipolar to act purely on urges, and be completely unfiltered, thought and reason falling to the wayside. During this week I behaved oddly, and started going by "Heavy Pie". I wasn't myself, but I thought my strange change in thought process was due to me maturing, not because of any mental issue going on. I was unaware I was bipolar, so the episode occurred in full force.On April 6th, I peaked. I hadn't been getting much sleep due to being manic (I was awake for about 48 hours) and started to hallucinate and have delusions. I hallucinated that my roommate proposed to me during a TF2 match (with Gabe Newell, "Yahtzee" of Zero Punctuation fame, and other famous people in the gaming community). As funny as that sounds, I honestly believed it to be true. I started to pursue my roommate in person, which scared him. He locked his door, and I pounded on it to get in, which scared him further. He called the police. Apparently, I wasn't "crazy enough" for them to do anything about me (I probably seemed drunk), but everyone else at the apartment left me for a while. I went into my roommate's room, drew a picture on his whiteboard, started going through his stuff--innocent wandering, though at one point I blacked out. The next thing I knew, I had stripped and was in his bed. I don't remember stripping, I just remember him coming into the room. He kicked me out of his room, I told him I loved him (remember, I hallucinated a proposal), and he kicked me out of the apartment.Again, I was acting purely on impulse with no thought in these matters. I was fully Manic for the first time in my life. I had no idea anything was wrong in my head. Now that I'm lucid, I understand these things now, and it terrifies me that I did these things. It's so unlike me, it feels like a different person did it. "Heavy Pie" is not me. I'm Devi. Not the person I became during the first week of April. And I'm definitely not the person I became from April 6.I don't really remember the next week. I have bits and pieces of it, but I was still under delusions. I ended up being picked up by my uncle, who took me somewhere to eat, where they threw me out because I wouldn't leave at closing time. Later on, I was taken to the emergency room, and later to a federal psychiatric facility for observation. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but it took me three weeks to come down from the delusions, and when I did, I was in a psychiatric facility, with practically no freedom save 30-minute breaks outside during the day. It was terrifying. I never want to go back there. However, I'm now medicated for my bipolar disorder and feeling like myself again.Near the end of my stay, I earned the right to use a computer, and the first thing I did was try to apologize to my roommate on Reddit. I wasn't completely lucid at the time, and as I came down from the delusions I continued to try to apologize with further messages. He didn't respond.When I was finally released, I discovered that my roommate had cut off all contact with me. He blocked me on Steam and Skype and presumably Reddit, and I've been afraid to contact him since then. Clearly I scared him. I was going to leave him be, hoping he'd come around.Then I found out he had made posts about what happened. Saying things that, to my knowledge, just aren't true. I repeat, I never thought to hurt my roommate. I was under the delusion of love, not violence, and any claim otherwise is simply wrong. I want to set the record straight now that I'm lucid. These rumors have caused a few other people to block me, and I'm not happy about being blocked for things that aren't true. So I'm giving my side of the story.If you have any questions, feel free to comment and ask them, or send me a message.[EDIT] Here's the other post for reference. I didn't read through the comments. I skimmed them and it hurt. But the title is false. I never tried to kill anypony. I remember April 6 the clearest out of all of my manic days--and I NEVER made a move of hostility.http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/rw86d/so_this_morning_rdj_and_his_roommates_were/[EDIT 2] I just wanted to note--I'm not trying to cause any drama here or antagonize anyone. I don't blame *anyone*--it's so easy to jump to conclusions when you can't hear all sides of the story. And my intent is to offer up mine in addition to the sides already presented, so you can draw your own conclusions. [info]  [info] 1335754344
bennyj72 [info] Alcohol and bipolar I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago and have been taking Celexa and Geodon to manage it. The thing about this through is that my ambitions have been dulled considerably and I feel like a shell of my former self. I was also a regular drinker during this time period but I quit drinking alcohol a few weeks ago after struggling to moderate. I would drink more on the weekends so much of my time and energy was used up by this habit. Now I find myself with a lot more time and energy on the weekends and I just want to keep doing projects around the house all day which also involves spending money. I’m not going overboard by any means, a hundred or so dollars here and there. I’m wondering if I’m going through a manic period or if it’s the lack of alcohol that is driving my energy. I haven’t made any changes to my medication so maybe the alcohol was just making me lazy. Perhaps it’s the gratification I get from these small projects that’s replacing the gratification i used to get by drinking. What do I do when I run out of projects to complete? Find another creative outlet? I see lots of folks here posting pics of there artwork when they are going through manic episodes but I’m not much of an artist. For those of you that do turn to creative outlets do you still have the need to pursue those when you’re not going through mania? I’m just beginning to learn more about this disease and it’s impact on my life. [info] None [info] 1580826121

yeslekkkk [info] My time in law school is more marked by my struggle with mental health. Law school is a very stressful experience, as you probably have never worked so hard in your life. I also did law review which is a shit load of work. Law school pushes people over the edge. For me, it brought out mental health aspects that I didn't even know existed. In a way, I'm thankful because it made my bipolar disorder come out and be so undeniable that I had to seek help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder halfway through. Like many other people on this site, it led me to behave in ways that I'm not proud of. I ended up hurting people and feeling ostracized. I would wake up everyday and have to face what I had done to people while still continuing to do my work. It was incredibly hard.I like the material of law school, and I'm really glad that I'm going into law. I wanted law school to stop because it was such a horrible period in my life, and it had more to do with where I was at.  [info] None [info] 1496941540

tessiiiss [info] Am I valid? About a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with bipolar and has since then been on medication and on a waiting list for CBT. I have had some therapy but and my boyfriend try to help me especially when I'm feeling bad in any way, but I've had a lot of problems knowing what I feel, and I also have extreme problems with making decisions, even down to silly small ones. I can't make up my mind of how I feel, what feelings I'm feeling, what I like, what I prefer, or anything related. I've always been like this for as long as I can remember and I've never thought anything about it, until now when I stumbled upon something called emotional neglect. After looking it up, I was amazed over how well it fitted in on me, especially passive childhood neglect.But the thing is, I grew up with parents that loved me, and with 3 much older siblings that were all teenagers when I was growing up, that also loved me. But even with a family that loved me, I often felt alone and invisible. My whole family was always very loud so I closed myself off and did my own thing. Also, as I'm the youngest of 4, my parents wasn't very strict at all. I chose my own rules and did what I wanted mostly, which made me spend a lot of time on my own. This is not all of it, but examples. And even if I feel as all the signs fits in on me, I don't feel as it's valid. I feel as since my parents and siblings loves me, I'm not "allowed" to , or as if it's not possible for me to suffer from emotional neglect. And yes, emotional neglect is more something that stems from what the parents don't do, instead of what they do, and my parents didn't helped me with my feelings as they should've done, but my family loves me so it feels as if im "blaming" my emotional problems on them... I'm sorry this is all messy, I don't have a doctor or therapist atm, so I can't take it up with them, but I can't get it out of my head. But, Is this worth to bring up when I do get my contacts under control? [info] None [info] 1557109609

FemaleScientist17 [info] So I just finished my third year of grad school in molecular biology and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this past year even though things have been rough for the past two years and I didn’t know why. I have not taken a leave of absence but it has been on my mind a lot. For me work and education was the most important thing my entire life, but when my world fell apart I have learned that you have nothing if you don’t have your health. My PI doesn’t know about my diagnosis but he does know that I have health issues. He is understanding about me having to be at appts and sometimes even taking a day off. I work as hard as I can in lab, but I don’t overdo it because that can be chaotic for me. As for labmates, they don’t know my diagnosis either, but know I have health issues. If they were actually nicer and more understanding people I might tell them, but knowing them rather well I feel like they would be judgemental. Everyone’s situation is different so telling then or anyone is something you should think about and base on your experiences with those people, which can be really scary but also can be rewarding in the end. As for the leave of absence, if you feel that is what’s best and will help you find your footing then do it. Ultimately, taking care of your mental health will make your life better overall. Good luck and stay strong. Keep working on yourself and on your science!  [info] None [info] 1533703711
newleafwiki [info] Can bipolar get worse over time? Ok so I am 23 years and have been experiencing hypomanic episodes since i was maybe 21. I am diagnosed with bipolar 2. My older brother is diagnosed with bipolar 1. Lately my hypomania has been getting long and more intense. At the beginning it would only be for a few hours and I could calm myself down if I really wanted to and tried very hard and took my meds. Now its much more intense. I have delusions of grandeur. I told a girlfriend I just got with that we were soulmates and tried to sleep with her even though we both knew i wasnt ready for that. Luckily she knew not to sleep with me for the first time while having an episode. I am very worried that my bipolar is just going to get worse until its as extreme as my brother. I know this could be at least partially paranoia but i just want to know if anyone knows anything about this. I’m too anxious and embarrassed as of now to bring it up to my T.

Fatassmatilda [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago and I was diagnosed with borderline 4 years ago. I think I was always both at the same time but they finally realized the borderline part too. So living with both idk I figured out bipolar i can see when I'm becoming manic when I'm becoming depressed but o god the mood switches with borderline are fucking terrible they can change at any moment so I am rapidly cycling through moods on top of whatever bipolar is doing to me. I don't have any friends n my family all want me dead. And on top of this I also have PTSD and a panic disorder. Idk I got hit with the crazy stick hard. One interesting thing though that made me respond to ur post is that everyone always tells me " ooo no u can be both bipolar and borderline it's one or the other " but my doctor's diagnosed me so fuck those people they r not doctor's idk have u ever had someone say that to you?

SophiaYiasemi [info] I had very mild depressive symptoms from the age of 12 or 13, and an actual depressive episode at 14. My parents and GP forced me to see a psychologist who was largely unhelpful. At 15 I had my first hypomanic episode that lasted ~5 months. I had lots of problems at school and was accused of taking drugs. And then it went away and I only had mild symptoms for the next year or so. When I was 17 I had a bad depressive episode and serious suicide attempt - so I was prescribed fluoxetine which triggered a mixed episode, and I became psychotic. After another hospital admission I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder aged 17. I was medicated and stable for a year and a half. And then was unmediated and incredibly unwell between the ages of 19 and 21. I’m now 23, and have been medicated and mostly stable for the last two years.  [info] None [info] 1515456738
littlelivethings [info] I would get some protein bars or Lara bars if you're more in need of carbs than protein for energy and eat them around the time you normally have breakfast/lunch. You will be less likely to binge in the evening, will have more energy, and will eventually start to realize when your body needs food even if you don't feel hungry. I was on Wellbutrin for a while and would constantly forget to eat and not feel hungry, just faint/exhausted/nauseous. I kept taking it even after I was diagnosed with bipolar (anti depressants triggered mania for me) because I was worried I would gain weight. Eat regularly, have energy, try to get yourself back to a healthy eating schedule while you recover.  [info] None [info] 1491094446
harlow1986 [info] Can anyone help me with my situation?? So I used to work for Piedmont Airlines under US Airways but had to leave due to medical issues. I was diagnosed with bipolar and unfortunately became medicine resistant. I now am being treated by getting Ketamine Infusions which have put me back in control and Its no longer an issue and I am ready and healthy to get back in the air. My problem is this...while I see a doctor who administers the ketamine its still known as a club drug and will no doubt show up in a urine drug test...I know that they’ll want to look into it as they did before when I was on adderall for a.d.d...and if they do theres a chance that they’ll find out about my diagnosis..which i know for a fact would be my kiss of death..i plan to keep my “illness” a secret because its no longer and issue and I know the stigma attached to it. Also they may just not accept me being on ketamine and working as a flight attendant due to peoples lack of knowledge about Ketamine and how beneficial it is to not only mentall issues but chronic pain as well.     Can anyone shed some light on this for me? Whether it be your knowledge of what they will or will not accept?

theskittlestubesock [info] Mixed episodes I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 17 (21 now) and I feel like I’ve never exactly been educated on what a mixed episode is. I’ve had hypomanic episode where I can’t sleep, have racing thoughts, act impulsively but in a negative way. The racing thoughts are negative and the impulsivity is things like getting into a fight with a friend. Basically I feel hypomanic but I’m sad. I’ve tried looking it up but it lists the symptoms of manic and depressive episodes and just says you have to have some of both. If you have had a mixed episode what was it like?

themarajade1 [info] Actually if you read my original comment, you’ll see that I clearly stated my defense for her. (which in case you can’t tell, is the very first reply to this whole comment thread.) Also, I’ve been through two nightmarish pregnancies, both alluded in the original comment. I had HG with my first and lost 15 lbs in the first trimester. I couldn’t even keep water down. Not to mention, he was born five weeks early and he’s now an autistic five year old boy. My daughter was conceived through a sexual assault, so imagine that, and the entire time I’ve had either of my children I’ve been a single mother. My entire experience as a parent has been borderline a nightmare. Also if we want to talk about mental health, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder right after my daughter’s birth and it’s taken me a really long time to get to where I’m at now, which is a good place. So don’t @ me with that no compassion bullshit.

growlergirl [info] You guys are being way too harsh on this girl. Let me guess, you're all a bunch of nice guys and nice guys finish last, right?I'm in the same predicament as this girl. I recently dumped a guy because I was falling in love with him. I broke it off because I was scared that sooner or later he'd see the real me then reject me. So I got in there and rejected him first as a defence mechanism. I felt so guilty that I wound up in hospital with self-inflicted injuries. The day after that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Your ex sounds like she has a similar pattern of behaviour. You saw her at her worst (drunk and careless) and I think she probably broke up with you because she felt ashamed of herself. She was afraid that eventually you'd begin to feel just as much shame for her as she does and dump her. So she beat you to the punch as a defence mechanism.Should you try and win her back? I don't know. If I had a chance to get back with my ex I probably wouldn't take it because I still have a long way to go before I get better and I wouldn't want him to have to endure me at my worst.She can only learn to love herself on her own, until she gets to that point she probably isn't ready for a relationship.

raynazyn [info] Is it normal to question your diagnosis? Struggling. Before I had my psych evaluation, I just *knew* I had bipolar. I was so excited for my appointment to finally have an answer as to why I act the way that I do.So, of course, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 on the 7th of this month. But do you ever feel like you’re *not*? A part of me thinks I just made it all up, even though I’ve attempted suicide at 20, have had passive suicidal thoughts since 11, had my first major depressive episode from 15-18, and had my first (that I’m aware of) hypomanic episode at 19.

Like why would anyone even fake this. God the lows are so crushing. When I’m baseline, both high and low are so far away that I can’t even believe I was that bad or that good.When I’m hypomanic, I always think that I’m “cured”, and “how could have I ever been suicidal?”When I’m depressed, I always think “how could have I ever been so happy?” [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1569454781
smallest_ellie [info] Totally. I'm diagnosed with bipolar as well and have never been able to have a healthy relationship very much because of me (which is something I've realised in retrospect).I feel like a sane person trapped in an insane person's body.My advice? Don't stress looking for love until you figure out how you can live with your diagnosis and be stable (as stable as is possible for you, I know it varies). Do it for you and not for a potential relationship in the future.Your relationship to yourself is the most important one you'll ever have.When you do find love - make sure to COMMUNICATE. And find someone who's willing to communicate with you.I recommend watching Lady Dynamite on Netflix if you haven't already. A crazy, absurd comedy series made by Maria Bamford who's also bipolar. It helped me a lot and it also touches on healthy relationships.Hugs! [info] Yuhua Hamasaki [info] 1520710158

NicedickEatfarts [info] Help me, how to talk to psychiatrist. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder &amp;PTSD, after doing a lot of research and recollecting the past few years. My wife and I (in our totally unprofessional opinion) feel that Bipolar I is likely my actual problem. We cataloged the last 2 years of my life and have noticed a definite up and down trend. During my manic phases I spend money with no regard( I've spent 15k on 3 separate manic phases on drugs, rc Hobby stuff, and whatever else), had sexual encounters with another woman, began to abuse opiates, mind races, started alot of projects, I have realistically 45-50 unfinished projects, stole from work was arrested, grandparents and brother, delusional thoughts of my abilities, poor or risky investments or ways to make money, and don't miss sleeping, I talk fast and mumble, I pace around constantly and always have to move part of my body usually I sort shake my hand like I just hit it with a hammer, I have extreme difficulty staying on task and I often forget what I am saying and pause only to move on to another topic. I become irritable easily, and have yelled or started fights I normally would not have. All of these have had a profound negative impact on my life. During my depressive phase, I sleep, low motivation to get out of bed, contemplate suicide, I've attempted 2 times, I have been in the VA psych ward 2 times. I have delusions my wife is leaving me, and the doctors are helping her plan. I have taking online bipolar questionnaires and have always scored 60pts, 51 and up is supposedly bipolar I highly likely. As of right now I am receiving ECT for my depressive state. I don't know how to approach my doctor about why I think I have Bipolar disorder. I feel like Doctors do not like when patients try to tell them their own diagnosis. I just want to get the correct medicine and treatment to put my life back together. Any way I can approach this without sounded like a hypochondriac? I'm currently taking suboxone, seroquel, venlafaxine, and hydroxyzine and receiving ECT.Edit: spellingUPDATE 12/2/2015Just left my appointment with my VA Doctor with my wife, notes and all the advice. I outlined my concerns  and my wife was there to further and better lay out the last couple years of my life. I was diagnosed with bipolar I with psychotic features and suicidal ideations. I told them about events on deployment that i've been wanting to talk about but couldn't because of an irrational fear of what my wife would think of me. I mean she will always be supportive I just don't want her to see me through the same eyes I see myself everytime I look in the mirror.  I'm now weaning off my antidepressant and starting a higher dose seroquel and lithium treatment. The doctor said that my antidepressant could be imbalancing my mood and increasing my instability. I told them stuff I couldn't have before seeking advice here. I told my wife about my trips to the cornado bridge, my failed attempt to OD. I am continuing ECT 3 times weekly. Thank you for all your help, I surrendered my firearms to my dad, and I received a notice from the VA saying I wouldn't be able to purchase firearms for 5 years or so, which is good.

forthelandfill [info] Using my throwaway, as I'm a frequent poster here.EDIT: (Screw throwaways, if you guys are being brave I can be brave too.  I'm u/porlabasura.)I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years ago after a manic episode/mental break that ended up being the most profoundly inspiring but also scary experience of my life.  It completely changed how I relate to life and to other people (I feel for the better) and gave me a renewed appreciation for all of life's beauty and mystery.  At the time, it felt like something akin to a spiritual experience.  I went pretty crazy for about three or four months.  I take care of myself by seeing doctors and taking my medication regularly, and I have been symptom-free for nearly a year, but the lessons I have taken from the experience will be with me (I hope) for the rest of my life.  Right now I hope to preserve my stability for decades to come, but of course with mental illness there are no guarantees.I believe the entire experience has made me more compassionate and empathetic, which are qualities I hugely value in myself and others.  The full story is one that is by turns deeply surprising, exhilarating, concerning, humbling, and uplifting, and one that is best told a few dates in.  I make it a point to be as straightforward as possible with the people I date and don't lie about this, and when I do end up telling the story I make sure they know that it's quite a lot to take in all at once.  Thanks for letting me share. [info] None [info] 1360783870
Rachnee [info] Trans Girl going to see psychiatrist for a potential diagnosis reconsideration tomorrow - wondering if others are in a similar position I don't know if anyone here would be offended by me posting here, but I have been reading the links and articles here and compared to the normal /r/aspergers subreddit the way females show aspergers seems to resonate with how I act more. I was diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD as a 9 year old kid, and put on nerouleptics (Invega) from when I was 13 until just over two years ago (currently 23). After coming off of the Invega, I keep showing more and more signs of aspergers (could the Invega have suppressed any autistic tendencies?) The more I look into aspergers in general the more I question the initial diagnosis I had and question my actions as a kid. I kept reading about how males presented aspergers and while it seemed to sort of fit, it didn't really explain it. Whereas while in the process of searching for answers I found BPD; it matched how I acted to a T. More recently (as in tonight) I was reading this subreddit looking for more answers as to what I have, and found that BPD and bipolar are common misdiagnosis in women with Aspergers. Does anyone have experience talking with or being an autistic trans girl who experienced aspergers in a typical female way versus what would have been considered for your birth gender (a typical male showing)? I know the article that made the clock turn over in my head was this one:https://everydayaspie.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/females-with-aspergers-syndrome-checklist-by-samantha-craft/I knock off literally almost every trait on that list. I know it's rude of me to ask for confirmation, but I just want to know how the community here experiences it, or if someone could direct me towards a sub reddit of transgender autistic girls or otherwise that I could talk to? Literally anything I can present to my psychiatrist will help in seeking this rediagnosis, because having the bipolar diagnosis on my file has done nothing but harm me, and prevent me from figuring out who I am (Long Term Antipsychotic (Invega) use I think?) And could have been making me present as bipolar; apparently long term antipsychotic use can make people bipolar in some ways? Anyways sorry for the long post, any help I can get in this matter would be great!Thank you so much!      Lily [info] None [info] 1500964209

froggiecrochet [info] I have to get this off my chest I don’t have anyone else to talk to I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 almost three months ago, we’ve been trying to adjust my mood stabilizer and finally found a happy medium. But with that has brought back my migraines. This is all bringing my marriage to a hault, we’re fighting because my husband doesn’t understand and seems to just blame me. I’m afraid I’m going to lose this job because I’m missing work. My migraines get so bad I can’t drive. And I’m afraid that my doctor is just going to take me off this one and not put me back on one. I feel so alone in all of this. I just don’t know what to do. I’m keeping my doctor up to date on everything. I’m just so over this crap called life. It’s like fml. I just want to give up right now. Maybe it would be best to get off the mood stabilizer for now see if my migraines get better... I don’t know it all just sucks [info] None [info] 1561557841
onehappyclam [info] Would you know if you had bp? Does your diagnosis seem to make sense? I've been diagnosed with bipolar and ADD. The ADD I feel makes sense but not bipolar. I've only been depressed in high school and for a short spell after breakups but am normally fairly cheerful but not over-the-top. My doc diagnosed me based a lot on the fact that I start a lot of projects that I don't finish, but that seems like it could be covered under ADD. It also seems as though many people (I've seen figures in the 20-40% range) get depressed for a time in high school during the teen angst period, so I'm tempted to not think too much of that.I spent 1.5 months in a psych ward for psychosis, but I'm 90% sure that was from smoking/withdrawal of K2 (that fake marijuana crap).What do you guys think? Do you "know" if you have it? Did it make sense to you once your diagnosis was presented and explained? Your responses would be really helpful because I just don't know what to do--my Dr. insists I have it despite my protests. Furthermore, he says the K2 might have prompted it, yet he diagnosed me based on stuff from before the K2 ever happened. Help please! :) [info] None [info] 1306122477
woobwoobzoob [info] I agree that an artist couldn't possible understand what it's like to have a serious mental illness, unless they've experienced it themselves.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have other issues though, and possible cluster B personality traits.  I find that art, like music, and even fictional characters sometimes helps me understand myself.  I mean, obviously, it's all fiction, so it's not going to be a perfect representation of my problems, but for me it helps. I think a really good therapist can somehow fuse the human condition, including art, and the science, and present it to you in a way you understand. [info] None [info] 1510262590
Seattleite97 [info] Poor speech/articulate skills. Why? Most of my life (elementary, jr high, HS) I've always been pretty articulate, especially for my age. My story telling was on point, explaining a situation or a scenario to someone was never difficult, just talking in general was never an issue for me. Being 19 going onto 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I recognized my thoughts were more racing, and my emotions were harder to control. My speech was still the same but I was definitely going through some huge (scary) changes. Around turning 21 is when the speech started to go. I started a new job wich tanked my confidence. That was over a year ago. I feel like its gotten a lot worse over the past year/year and a half. It feels like my brain cannot put the right words together in the ride order. Its honestly caused me to become socially awkward. Has anyone had this happen? Is there a different subreddit I should be posting this on? Im desperate for help. It's terrible feeling this stupid. Especially when I was so 'on' the majority of my life.I do smoke weed but that's been an ongoing thing since I was 17. [info] None [info] 1575227479
Beaky1505 [info] My (25F) PMS and periods have been getting worse each month. It starts at least 10 days before my period and my mood swings are horrendous, I get horrendous cramps and sore breasts and body aches and night sweats. I'm a right misery to be around and just want to cry and complain and eat chocolate.Then my period comes and it's heavy for 3 days then abruptly stops... No light bleeding just pure heavy blood.It's horrid. It's been horrid since I came off birth control after having my son in 2015 as I was diagnosed with bipolar shortly after and the pill messed with my moods more.But just these last few months they've been getting worse. I think the PMS is the worse part. It's shit because for about 10 days in a month I feel full of energy, skinny, healthy, happy and free.Fuck periods. [info] None [info] 1587552523
MySpinMove95 [info] I honestly don't think they were doing it for the good of my child. I have no criminal record, no drug issues...they flat out said I was depressed and that makes me unable to care for my toddler, and I don't deserve him. Mind you....none of this is true. They went through my old Facebook messages with my ex (and sadface reacted to me saying how much i miss my son at like 3 in the morning.. on my dead exes account, like a week after he died) and found out that I had an abortion (my own and my exes desires, nobody was forced and we were both totally okay with it). They tried to say that makes me an unfit mother. They also used the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple years back, and was anorexic when I was a *teenager* against me. Mind you, I go to a therapist, and am on medication for my bipolar 2, and they knew this. Being depressed doesn't mean you deserve to have your son taken from you. Also, another thing that makes me think the "best interests" argument is bullshit. A few days before my ex died, he sent me a message saying he's doing fine for the time being, but if anything happens to him, he knows he'll be well taken care of with my boyfriend and i. He sent a 3 paragraph message to me on Facebook thanking me for giving him a son, loving him so much, and being a kind mother to him. I KNOW his parents saw that bc of the random 3 am sadface reaction. I have never done anything but love my son and try to give him a "normal" life. I'm not perfect, but they made up lies and tried to put my life under a microscope to take him away from me. Shit, the courts even try to reunite crackheads with their parents...yet I'M unfit and THEY'RE the best when all they do is park him in front of an ipad... ok. I've lost a sister, and when she died, my own father tried to take her kids from their biological dad. You'd be surprised at how common this bullshit is. It's all centered around selfishness.

LusciousPubes [info] I'm just meaning that researchers haven't gone out of their way to be sexist. It was a product of the times.It's also my right to deal with the fact I have an iud that caused 3 months of hell. I got it for me, not anyone else, even though I was in a long-term relationship at the time. It may be a little different in my country as we have a public health system and so finances aren't really an issue. I've also never had a doctor take bc lightly - I was given information on all the options. When I was diagnosed with bipolar they were extremely careful about which bc I had - basically nothing hormonal. So they were extremely open about potential side-effects. I personally would feel a bit weird relying on someone else for bc, so either way I would have gotten it. It's my body so I see it as my responsibility. Not everyone feels like that, so male bc will be an amazing thing.Just had a thought - it's probably tied into the taboo of periods etc. and pms symptoms are potentially why it's side-effects have been played down. Amongst everything else. The reason I keep saying to read -wasn't meant to be patronising sorry - is partly because it's a bit of an echo chamber in this sub imo. The AMA was a fantastic insight into it, that's why I kept mentioning it.  [info] None [info] 1532431618

I'm not looking for medical advice, I'm just looking for some interesting explanation. One year before I was diagnosed, I got a new job. Giving presentations was part of my job. I noticed that during presentations and also in everyday conversations some words were just...lost. I knew what I wanted to express, but I would just forget the word, and it happened a lot of times. A lot at the beginning, and then it reached a minimum limit but there were still times in which I just couldn't find the word. I was 23 years old then. I don't have that symptom anymore.

egretregrets [info] Yes, that's how I was for years; just absolutely depressed, and then as years went by, hypomanic features started showing up as irritability and anger. They eventually became frequent, which is how I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. The more I think about how I was before diagnosed, the more I realize I may have been BP instead of unipolar depressed. This is why bipolar2 is so difficult to diagnose. Then there's mixed episodes, too, to further confuse diagnosis. In a nutshell, it's quite possible. Hypomania is much more subtle, too, than the mania of BP 1. [info] None [info] 1503177809

kohays [info] Yeah smoking can bring out psychosis. Drinking is okay in moderation but it's best to stay away completely from substances when you are dealing with OCD. I have pure O too so I know what you mean, I have an obsession about developing schizophrenia and when something seems off I go into a mode where I start getting paranoid that I'm crazy, seeing things, hearing voices. But the thing is I know it's all in my head. Anyways, from what you described it sounds like it's just obsessive thoughts, are you diagnosed with ocd? Or on medications for it? I was on Luvox and it did help alot with the intrusive thoughts and conversations I get in my head from ocd. Unfortunately I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I can't take Ssri's anymore as they tend to bring out mania. But for intrusive thoughts the best thing is Luvox, exercise, staying sober, keeping busy, and eating healthy.Are you seeing a therapist for OCD as well? [info] None [info] 1529446860
katatl [info] I genetically am predisposed to addiction but didn’t realize I was an addict until I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year. I was lucky in some sense that my addiction was cigarettes and a ridiculous amount of pot, but it was still pretty hellish and I felt completely out of control. For me, my addiction was actually really escapism. The smoking was great but it was more I was addicted to running away from myself. It has taken a lot of time to be able to be quiet with myself without altering my state chemically, and I’m still fucking up here and there (sometimes everywhere) but I’m blessed to have a support system of friends who know that though it’s not their responsibility to keep me sober, it is important that I can share with them and be honest about my struggles. Good luck. [info] None [info] 1562511651
vicuna76 [info] Why the heck do I feel in the wrong taking medication that helps me? I was diagnosed with bipolar back when I was in middle school and improperly treated for it for YEARS . A few years ago I was evaluated again and found out I do not have bipolar and it's ADHD. I was put on Adderall and instantly (for the first time in my life) felt okayI now take Vyvanse 50mg in the morning and (if needed) 5 mg of Adderall in the afternoon to get through the rest of the work day. When I take my medication I feel like myself. I feel like I can think clearly. Be productive. Carry a conversation. Be a better friend. I just feel like I can be the best version of myself when I take my medication. I get confused though because when I don't take it I basically feel like shit and can't get anything done. My friends confuse me by saying things like "oh you're addicted to your medication that's why" or that I'm dependant. I don't know if I'm dependant or not... I guess I depend on it to make me feel better? I don't know. I feel guilty and ashamed taking this medication because why the f can't I achieve being my best version without it? My friends claim it's because "I'm probably high all day" Does anybody else feel anything similar to this? Should I stop letting my friends confuse me because they clearly ARE NOT medical doctors???  Do you think it's some type of bias because it's an amphetamine?? What do you think? [info] None [info] 1561318138
porscheboxer [info] Sick of Los Angeles and looking to relocate It's time that I leave Los Angeles. Life isn't very enjoyable here. The people in general aren't very friendly. Everything is expensive.I think San Antonio might be the place for me.I'm 34 years old. No significant other. (Ended a three-year living-together relationship on Wednesday.) No children.I was an attorney (litigator) for 6 years. I'd often work from 7:00 a.m. (court appearances) to 10 p.m. (drafting, phone calls, emails, etc.) Although the pay was admittedly good, I hated the life I was living. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and I had to change careers, or jeopardize my mental health. (I'm thankful I have my condition well-managed.)Currently I write software end-user documentation, which I really enjoy doing. This work is done entirely remotely. I also do IT consulting for small business (mostly small law offices). It's nothing significant: setting up network equipment, installing and configuring software, etc. I have about 20 years of Linux sysadmin experience but no formal training or certification. I wouldn't mind getting training/certification if it'll open up job opportunities.I enjoy and want to continue living a simple life. When I'm not working, I'm typically at home reading or writing. I don't care for fancy things. I save my money. My idea of a good time is having my friends and family over for dinner or a hookah session. Friends and family are all that matter to me.So, I'd very much appreciate help answering the following questions:1. Is San Antonio generally as friendly as it's made out to be? I always hear that the people are open to introducing themselves and are willing to get to know other nice people. To add perspective: I've had the same neighbors for over 10 years. I know only 3 of them. I'm hoping to make new friends as I'd be moving to San Antonio by myself.2. How difficult is it to find a nice one-bedroom apartment in a safe, clean neighborhood, for less than $1,500 a month? That's what I'm currently paying for a one-bedroom apartment with no included amenities other than a parking space and a laundry room. This is in a relatively nice neighborhood, but if I throw something off my balcony, chances are I'll hit a homeless encampment.3. With my skill set, should I expect difficulty finding work paying at least $40,000 a year? Low stress is much more important to me than high pay. I don't want to put my mental health at risk. I don't mind pulling cables or refurbishing computers or otherwise working with my hands. I like working with my hands.4. What are some of San Antonio's bad aspects? For the most part, I get only one answer: the weather.I've searched the Web for answers to the above questions. But, almost all of the results are blogs, which I find usually are just clickbait and not very credible.If there's anything else I should probably know, please share.Thank you very much for your time.

mischief-managedd [info] I tried to kill myself. She visited me in the psych ward  and she told our friend group that I tried to kill myself over a guy (which is NOT true) I was diagnosed with bipolar after my attempt and she would always tell me to “hop on taking my pills” if I expressed any emotion other than happiness. She also drunkenly messaged our mutual friend and said “The next time mischief-managedd tries to kill her self, tell her I’ll push her off that overpass next time and make it look like she slipped.” (My attempt involved an overpass....) I was heartbroken. I cut her off completely and she tried talking to my boyfriend and telling him I was an awful person and that my promiscuous past would catch up to me and we would break up.

jessicadiamonds [info] I think INFO is the only way to actually respond to this. She has told you she does not feel "love" for people. But perhaps that is just the perception of what neuro-typical people act like love is. Maybe she doesn't even understand it? Her brain doesn't work the same way as the larger population of people, but that doesn't mean that there isn't any kind of feeling at all towards others, otherwise I'm not sure you would have a relationship with her in any meaningful way. I mean, love isn't a specific thing. We as a society act like it must be this very specific thing, but what is that? I believe it is different to each person. The fact that her boyfriend loves her and wants to marry her tells me that they at least on paper have a good relationship. Do you believe that she has manipulated her way into this for the purpose of some sort of gain, like wealth, status or security? Sociopathy is not actually a medical term, and ASPD focuses mainly on behaviors rather than specific traits, or psychopathic traits. It doesn't sound like she behaves in the same way that she did when she was diagnosed, am I hearing that correctly? &gt; DSM criteria include a disregard for and violation of others' rights since age 15, as indicated by seven possible features: failure to obey laws and norms by engaging in behavior which results in [criminal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/punishment) arrest, or would warrant criminal arrest; lying, [deception](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/deception), and manipulation, for profit or self-amusement; impulsive behavior; irritability and [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger), manifested as frequently assaulting others, or engaging in fighting; blatant disregard of safety of self and others; a pattern of irresponsibility; and lack of remorse for actions. \*This is from [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-is-2020/201812/difference-between-the-psychopath-and-so-called-sociopath) about the difference between ASPD and psychopathic traits, for others who are reading this. I think it's much more complicated than anyone here can say. I definitely do not believe that a DSM diagnosis is something that anyone else should disclose other than the person with the diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, which I am open about, but I would not want other people telling my own diagnosis, especially since I have sought to manage my behavior, which it sounds like she is doing.&amp;#x200B;Lastly, does it matter if her love is real or if she is just going through the motion of it for her own happiness?

shawnbenteau [info] Lithium and loss of identity I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 just about two years ago now and have been on lithium since. I started at I think 600, then 900 after a few weeks, then 1050 a few months later and finally 1200 after my counts didn't come back after a rough bout of serotonin syndrome a year and a half ago.The changes were so slow that I didn't notice them until I went back and read posts I had made at the time. I've never really interacted with other bipolar people so I don't have much frame of reference, and I've been worrying lately that I might just be different now and I don't notice it (from either the lithium or the serotonin syndrome). It feels like the kind of thing that's impossible to know. I can't remember who I was six months ago, much less two years.I've had the intrusive thought of "stop taking your meds they're bad for you and you don't like swallowing them" and was hoping to reach out for some commentary one way or the other.

gaylor_swift [info] Anything is potent to me, it's craziness. Hahaha. I'm such an oversensitive pansy (I'm kidding, I love myself, I swear), even at 6'1"!! It seems my body cannot tolerate many substances at all, even if they're meant to help me!! It's unfortunate for me. Anyway, I imagine my neurologist &amp; I will be back to the drawing board for this one. This isn't unsurprising to me, though. See... I've struggled with mental health in the past as I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder too &amp; I never responded to typical medical treatment for that either. My neurologist was excited to try Topamax for me because it's sometimes prescribed for bipolar as well, so she was like, "Wow, wouldn't it be great if it worked for you?? Knock out two issues with one medication." Clearly, I'm not lucky enough for that, though. Haha.Also, I know you might not do this, but if anyone hops in this thread to lecture me... I know, it's "bad" to go around unmedicated as a bipolar person, but it wasn't even fully my choice. This was a decision made by my doctors because of how harshly I've reacted to many classes of drugs used to treat it in most patients. I'm monitored by a team of doctors &amp; therapists, but they're not worried about me at the moment. I've honestly learned to cope with my highs &amp; lows with therapy. I wish that therapy was a super effective treatment for the type of migraines I'm having, but I don't think positive affirmations is going to stop me from stumbling &amp; nearly falling over because of vision loss from a sudden onset of a migraine. Haha. This sucks.Thanks again to everyone for their continued support, though!! I've been in touch with professionals &amp; I will be seeing my doctor this week, so I hope something good comes up.

MadCalvanist [info] ITT: Look, we can form words!Listen. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since 1997. I recently graduated Magna Cum Laude from Liberty University with a Bachelor of Science in Religion. Do you know how many pastors there are out there who have this disease?Calling it the work of demons only lends credence to the superstitious nonsense of backwater hillbilly country Christians who think *indoor plumbing* is the work of the devil. Just because its not curable doesn't mean there's no medicinal answer. In fact there are so many treatment options, if the doctor tries you on one and it doesn't work, guess what? You try another one. There are actually enough that within the typical ten year period they project to finding your best diagnosis, you will have found the exact right amount of medication and/or therapy.We live in a fallen world - sin is part of the natural order. The devil might try and take advantage of your condition, and by all means, that can and will happen. But remember even Paul had a thorn in his side, we don't know the nature of, but God didn't heal for one reason - it was Paul's job to work *in spite* of that thorn for the glory of God. Bipolar disorder is not your demon, its your thorn. It's your opportunity to glorify God by overcoming your illness every day... not by curing it. By defeating it daily. I've been doing it now for 17 years. Some people have done it for far longer. You can do it to. But do it with your doctor - not a bunch of armchair theologians and the opinion machine of Reddit.

Perkinz [info] Eh, from where I am you're all eastern ;)And to be honest, I'm not sure why.I doubt it's insomnia, though it's definitely easiest to describe it like that.It happens maybe once every month or two though.For a couple of days I'll be... definitely not amped or energetic, but well, "normal"---Like a short rest would be nice but can be done without----And when I do go to sleep it's for short periods of time (3~5 hours) and I wake up feeling groggy but otherwise still good to go-----And then for a couple days I go to sleep early and sleep for long periods of time (9~12 hours).Typically the whole cycle is over in less than a week, though a couple years back I remember one time where just the first phase lasted 2 weeks.Last night was the first night this time and I was able to get to sleep decently ish, and I assume this coming night or the one after will be the last of the first phase.I know back in high school I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I was on the pills for that it was much, much worse---But, then, my mother was going doctor shopping for someone who'd believe everything she said, so who knows whether or not I actually have bipolar disorder and if its even related to this at all.All that said, apart from a small handful of times it's not debilitating or hindering and I function well despite it.I've definitely come to like the second part, though.I get the best sleep then----When I'll lay down in bed it'll just feel like I'm melting into my bed and it's just so damned comfortable and I wake up feeling real nice.Definitely have to thank this, though, as those nights where I'm unable to sleep gave me a chance to woo my current girlfriend and she's absolutely wonderful.

jaahrome [info] Misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Long story short, I quit Navy boot camp, was sent to a psychologist, answered a few questions, and then I believe I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I insisted that I didn’t need meds and I just wanted to go home, and I feel like she diagnosed me with the disorder just so I could. I’m mentally stable. The answers I gave her weren’t really ones I’d consider to be deciding factors on the diagnosis either. Example: Q: “Has there ever been a time where you’ve felt very happy and confident and then very sad and doubtful?”A: “Yes?”I feel that everyone has those days. But after all that, I insisted that I didn’t need any meds and I wanted to just go home.So now I want to re-enlist into the Air Force. My code is Re-3e, which means I can enlist with a waiver and that my enlistment was erroneous. JFC is the code. Went to my recruiter, said that I wanna re-enlist, but he said he would need more documents relating to my separation from the Navy because I only had 1 page of my dd 214. I’m not sure if the documents I’ve requested from the National Personnel Records system in St Louis say that I officially have Bipolar disorder, because if it did, I’m thinking that I wouldn’t be eligible to re-enlist, but I just want to be extra sure.  Is it possible I can get re-evaluated by another psychologist and show the results to my recruiter so we can move forward with the process? I was a dumbass a year ago and I didn’t know what exactly i was signing up for and didn’t care cause I thought boot camp was gonna be cake. When I was shown otherwise, I wanted out. But now I think I need to try again. Tl;dr: Went to navy boot camp, quit, I think I was  “diagnosed” with Bipolar Disorder, insisted I didn’t need meds or anything, (because I knew I wasn’t mentally ill) went back home, now I need to re-enlist, codes are Erroneous enlistment, re-3e, JFC, not really sure if I officially have bipolar disorder, requested separation documents. Is it possible to re-enlist after a second (or third) psychological assessment stating that I am not mentally ill? [info] None [info] 1564125235
LeleBeatz [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar II as well as a lot of other things that never really stuck.

der_konig [info] I'm an INTP with bipolar disorder Just felt the need to share this with someone, and the rest of my fellow INTPs seemed fair enough, since I found this revelation to be quite interesting. Hopefully you guys do as well.I've been interested in psychology for years, and though the Meyers-Briggs personalities aren't largely accepted by psychologists/psychiatrists, i still found it interesting as a means of  categorization. Many years ago I took several tests (I originally tested as an ENTP) and realized that I identified with INTPs the most. Weak I, weak N, strong T and P. So that's the background.Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II), and it really changed my perspective on my entire life. While I'd always known that I fit the INTP type best, there always seemed to be inconsistencies. Every so often, I'd act completely irrationally, was overly emotional, and saw things as much more black and white. Oh, not to mention the paranoia that ensued. Being diagnosed as bipolar helped explain much of that. Those were the times I was experiencing a hypomanic episode.These episodes caused my otherwise stable and normal life into quite a mess. It would always seem to happen right as things were getting back to normal and all was well. Then I'd do something crazy and fuck it all up. Destroyed relationships, fucked up my finances, failed easy classes, etc. The exact opposite of an INTP. After reading up on it more, a personality change is often an indicator that a manic episode has started or well on its way.Now I'm on medication, and seeing both a psychologist and psychiatrist regularly, and I'm starting to piece my life back together. But it's strange; sometimes I miss the craziness, the rush, the energy, and the willingness to follow my every impulse, no matter how idiotic.Anyway, I am posting this more for myself than anything else, but hopefully you guys could find it somewhat interesting.

However, my psychiatric nurse practitioner is thinking I might have ADHD and has scheduled me for a neuropsychological testing to get a more accurate diagnosis. Due to insurance complications, I've had a hard time finding a therapist since my previous one stopped accepting my insurance. Do you happen to know anything about this testing?

throwawaysue [info] Any psych nurses that have a touch of the crazy themselves? Does it help, hinder, both...? BSN student here that is having a hard time with my pull to psych after a clinical rotation. Long, but tl;dr at the end. First of all, I have already scoured the sub for psych threads and gotten a lot of great info - thank you! I'm an older nursing student (mid-30's) and have always been drawn to working in an ER - it's fast paced, requires the ability to think quickly, and you get to see a variety of problems.  I am open to other departments/opportunities and always figured I'd find my love while working in the ER.  I have been working with my school to set up my senior experience in an ER.  It seemed pretty much what I've been wanting since I decided I wanted to be a nurse in my 20's.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago, spent a long time bouncing from medication to medication, all the time one of those "functional" types who was a hot mess at home but managed to not only keep a job, but excel at work.  About four years ago, I ended up in a DBT group that helped me immensely.  With the help of my local community mental health center, I weaned myself off of antipsychotics and regular use of benzos (not addiction, just didn't have tools to manage the stress - thank goodness!) and started back to school.  Even with the intense pressure of getting my undergrad, applying to nursing school, making it in and doing well there, I haven't really had many issues with my mental health.  Mostly, I live hypomanic, but as my therapist used to say, I am competent in "using my powers for good, not evil."I recently had the opportunity to do a rotation at a state mental health hospital.  I was FLOORED by the immense amount of cooperation and teamwork among the staff.  I loved learning about the patients, and although I feel like I'm terrible at therapeutic communication (I really have to stop and think about what I'm saying - moreso than in other health care settings, it seems) I really liked forming a connection with people who tend to have a hard time forming them.  While I have never suffered as severely as many of the gravely disabled patients, I have met so many that had throughout my treatment periods and instead of feeling contempt or disgust, I find it easy to empathize with them.  The patients I met in the state hospital were sometimes scary, but always amazing.  The strength of the mentally ill is unique.So, as you can tell, I'm a little infatuated with psych.  I'm worried, however, that dealing with some of those issues on a long-term basis may be bad for my own stability.  I'm worried that I empathize TOO much and may end up crossing boundry lines in misguided attempt to connect with a difficult patient.  I'd just like to hear if there are any success (or not!) stories, or even third-hand accounts of other nurses with mental health problems working on their own.tl;dr: I have mild bipolar that is well controlled and have a sudden interest in psych - any input is welcome on why I should/should not consider working in a psych capacity, especially from nurses in a similar boat.

MusicalTourettes [info] It's pretty atypical. It could be that he's on the autism spectrum but high functioning enough that no one has said anything. It could be a form of self harm. It could be another emotional processing issue that hasn't been diagnosed and treated. It could be that he's just still acting like a toddler and hoping to get his way, but that seems the least likely at this age.I'm sorry your mom won't take you/it seriously. I hope he gets the help he needs. My parents denied my mental illness even when I begged to go to therapy at 14 (seriously, what 14 year old does that?) I was diagnosed with bipolar in my 20s when I finally got some help. That was a lot of years of pain because my parents refused to accept I needed help.

frenchiestfry96 [info] Yes! A ton! I personally have a lot of addiction in my family as well as mental illness. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I keep a strict regimen of what drugs I ingest (weed and alcohol only on rare occasions) just because I'm paranoid I'll turn into one of my family members. I say this only because I think a lot of the kids in med school live in a bubble. They've usually grown up in upper class families in safe neighborhoods. These kids don't know how surprisingly functional addicts can be. I know a ton of kids who have self-diagnosed themselves with mental disorders/illnesses so they can take the class II drugs. Even worse, some of these kids have doctors in the family who write them scripts whether or not they have an actual issue. They'll  often abuse stimulants or painkillers in the morning, only to go home and drink a ton in the evening. However, they would never tell you they may have a problem. Most of them believe the stereotype of the "drunken bum": If you're not poor, living in an alley, and smell like 5 year-old hot milk, then you CANNOT be an addict.  [info] None [info] 1547617186
1LongStorm [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar2 when I turned thirty. It cost me my job, my relationships and my entire world pretty much fell apart. Through years of meds, therapy and sheer determination I feel like most of the time I manage the beast. I now care for my 94 year old Gran, my Dad who is in a care home dying of COPD, and this weekend my Mom is in the hospital following a heart attack. My ability to care for others came from my learned ability to face things one at a time, stay mindful, avoid triggers and know and respect my own limitations. A huge part of my ability to function came from the epiphany that my brain has a glitch and I can't just allow it to randomly choose emotions and reactions... I am my own mental police. It was really hard to accept my limitations, but being stubborn about self care and self monitoring has been essential in allowing me to be well enough to care for my family members as well as myself. I found peace in mindfulness. My mantra is "I am here, and it is now." It has been surprisingly effective in helping me remain grounded in the now without letting the future or past overwhelm me. I also repeat ad nauseum "It is what it is" Acceptance of reality moment to moment helps me cope. Edit: I also read a LOT. The best escape is always a good book and there are always books to help understand/deal with  pretty much any situation. And I ditched TV 12 years ago because it is a trigger for me.

silent-roar [info] Is it worth it to see a doctor for mild focus problems? I’m a 21yo white female in Indiana. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I do not currently take medication due to successful CBT therapy. I’m 5’2” and roughly 125lb. I have problems focusing for long periods of time as required by college classes. I smoke marijuana but not cigarettes, and I only smoke at night in very small quantities. I have previously been prescribed Wellbutrin (25mg I think) which caused me to have blurry vision and also adderall (10mgXR) which I feel is too intense. I currently drink coffee which I find is incredibly helpful for my focus. I don’t really like to drink coffee because of caffeine addiction potential and the negative effects on teeth. I’m wondering if there are medications I could take that would essentially be like drinking a coffee (a 12oz cup provides me positive effects for about 8 hours) but won’t be too intense like the adderall I used to take. I’m sorry if this is a ridiculous question I’m just not sure if it’s even worth pursuing a medication, and I have no knowledge of potential medications that may help. Any advice is appreciated. This has been a problem for me my entire life, however my courses are now difficult enough that I really need the extra help for focusing and motivation. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

mrscarpenter25 [info] Hi there ,I know your looking for an answer from a specific type of people , but I felt I needed to give my advice about the medicine from my point of view. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1. My psychiatrist prescribed me zoft ( the generic brand sertraline ) once a day and another antipsychotic rispodone once ever evening. It took a couple months for me to finally start feeling happy (peaceful) again. I never once decided not to take my medicine at will (once or twice I would forget if I had a busy morning) . The biggest advice and fact you should know is if you are not getting your proper sleep , you medicine will not work . You must let your doctor know your sleep amount and if your having issues. There is help and it does take time and patients . I hope it gets better for you !  [info] None [info] 1424881660
EvilAngel13 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1, schizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder years ago.  I was absolutely terrifed and heartbroken and embarrassed but I did believe it...and I spent about a year going to therapy and trying to find the right cocktail of medications that would help me "function normally" without making my entire life suck (lol).I ended up gaining a ton of weight and spent several months feeling emotionally numb, completely detached from everything and just sort of existing rather then living.  I pretty much gave up and bought into the drs and my (now ex) husband's assertions that this was how my life had to be and that wandering around in a numb, emotionless fog was better than riding the rollercoaster that was my life before. Until one of my daughters' best friends (they were elementary school age at the time) was hit by a car on her bicycle right in front of our home and did not make it.  And I felt nothing.  Literally, nothing.  Not at the accident scene. Not at the hospital.  Not while my 2 little girls were clinging to me for comfort.  Not at the funeral.  The night after the funeral I was trying so hard to just feel...something and it kind of dawned on me that the medications I was taking were the cause. I threw them all out and flushed them that very night and I haven't touched psych meds since.  I quit seeing all of the drs and therapists.  And have never gone back.  My (ex)husband tried ultimatums, coercion...even force to get me back on medication and back into treatment but I absolutely refused.  He ended up moving out and I filed for divorce immediately. It took some time to get everything out of my system and to sort of reshape my thoughts pertaining to mental illness, personality disorders and the field of psychiatric medicine.  While I do believe that mental illness obviously does exist and I would never ever discourage someone who feels they need help from seeking treatment. I also believe that sometimes drs/pdrs are too quick to diagnose and medicate what just a few years back would be considered personality traits but are now labeled as mental illness. I realize this isn't going to be a popular statement and I hope that I don't sound critical or judgmental or unsupportive. [info] None [info] 1563026171
YOUREABOT [info] The line between logic/delusion gets really blurry during manic episodes, especially with the internet. Who's to say what's possible. Done different he might have actually been able to get Drake, or some other big name, to come out.  I just started to come down from about a two weeks of mania. I ended up doing a couple of mania fueled things (like deciding to raise money to fly from Taipei, Taiwan to Milwaukee to see a Wu-Tang concert…  haha ) I've been documenting the whole thing (in a long form sloppy way).  What I know, that other people don't, is that these "manic projects" often times have paydays at the end up them. Like, for example, in 2008/9 (while at the peak of my YouTube career) I won a laptop from Tim Ferriss and  a car with free gas and insurance from Ford (when the launched the Ford Fiesta). If anyone saw what I was doing and thinking to myself behind the scenes I was clearly manic in both cases (I was diagnosed with bipolar in 1999). I was actually off my meds too.  Anyhow… it's complex. The "delusions" can have very real positive effects. For example the delusion from my first manic episode set me on a path to becoming a serious martial artist.  Anyhow… there's a bit about me. :) Thanks for making this video. I subscribed and hit the bell button (the first time I've done that. :) ) [info] None [info] 1552291793
sayheythrowawayy [info] How to discuss med changes? Foggy/tired I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 in my teens. I was medicated for a little bit, my mother didn't like it and pulled me off. I started my meds journey 3 years ago and I haven't quite ever find a 100% kosher combination, to me anyway. I'm definitely in a better place than I was 4 months ago, 4 months ago I was planning my suicide and happened to start therapy the very next day, coincidentally. For the last 4 months I was put on 750 mg of depakote, 20 mg of latuda, 10 mg of buspirone 2 times a day (I usually forget one dose), and 25 mg of hydroxyzine every 6 hours as needed (I usually forget these and they make me very dizzy and my legs wobbly and I feel like they don't do a damn thing).I cannot take the foggy, words being jumbled, difficulty waking up/tired while driving, inability to focus, incredible weight gain anymore.How do I explain this to my doctor? Would it be odd if I asked for something to help with the foggy/inability to focus portion? It is like there is a huge disconnect between portions of my brain and definitely my mouth. I know they don't make a pill for weight gain but despite my best efforts... the weight just keeps coming.Help please. [info] None [info] 1575468002

dblumens [info] Mental illness has been a huge part of my story/growth. Should I leave it out of a PS? I've been in recovery for more than two years and am good at taking care of myself, live on my own, take medication etc. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder ii in high school and had been hospitalized twice before the diagnosis. This is a huge part of my identity and makes my academic successes all the better in recovery. My timeline shows that I took responsibility for myself, and the things I do now on a weekly basis are things I was never sure would be possible. My improvements and successes are apparent. So, should I never speak of my diagnosis or anything else to do with it in a personal statement or potential interview?

Let me tell you, pedophiles are scum of the fucking Earth. They deserve to burn for eternity, with what they do to children. If they don't act on their urges, whatever, I don't care.

From fourth to seventh grade, I was bullied horribly. People telling me to kill myself, I got in fights, it was bad. I started cutting at age nine. I tried to kill myself three times at eleven. I was fucked up. I was depressed.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in sixth grade, or when I was eleven. I went in a psychiatric hospital. I got medication, but it didn't work.I started hallucinating, and developed sociophobia, in ninth grade. Or around there somewhere. I had panic attacks every day, and by this time I was off medication for some reason, so I had nothing to help with my bipolar disorder.I went to a psychiatric hospital again, and was put on a different medication. That one worked for a while, then they switched me because of hormone levels, and that one worked until a few months ago.Now I'm seventeen, and fucked up with no medication to help.

Lipbanging [info] Mental Illness Resource Suggestions So next week is NAMI's mental illness awareness week October 5-11.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 4 years ago, but I've only recently been speaking out about my experiences.  I posted something small about mental illness in response to Robin Williams' suicide, but other then that I've been very quite about living with bipolar.  But I've decided that I'm part of the problem if I continue to stay quite.  I really need to speak up if there is any hope of the stigma attached to mental illness to ever go away.  So for this year's NAMI Mental Illness Awareness Week I want to post a different resource everyday day of the week. I was thinking of posting things like blogs about what living mental illness is like, how to support mental illness charities, different resources about how to get help, or just a helpful article about how to support someone with mental illness. I have some ideas in mind but I was wondering if any of you had a good resource I could include.  I really want to post some good information so if anybody has any ideas I would really appreciate it. Thanks! [info] None [info] 1412039492
rorylupin [info] Distraught over symptoms and diagnosis I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 over summer after being hospitalised for a manic episode where I became acutely psychotic. Since then I’ve experience a mixed episode,during which I displayed psychotic symptoms and have been pretty stable for about two weeks. Last week I became really paranoid for a few days. I feel very suspicious of my parents, who I live with, and kept thinking they had been altered and weren’t their original selves. I also had several auditory hallucinations for just one day. This whole this is extremely worrying as I have been violent when psychotic before (if I feel my life’s in danger, I’ll fight and have assaulted staff). I have a great MH team but I’m hiding things from them, I don’t want to tell them about potential psychotic stuff because I can’t face it, I can’t face them suggesting I’m Schizoaffective or prone to psychosis or this is going to happen again. I just don’t want to even think about it. I don’t want this to be happening. I’ve worked hard to get into university and want to get my degree and not be sick (already been signed off for like two month - drs orders). I think if they suggest I might be regularly psychotic or more than BP (which I’m already struggling with) I might end it. I don’t want to put people through episodes time and time again, the last ones were hellish enough and it’s not fair. I’m drinking to cope but am epileptic and constantly consumed by guilt. My parents are away for two weeks and I’ve asked for them to be cut out I’m my care updates whilst they’re away so they can enjoy their holiday. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want this.

pkbooo [info] It sounds like this feeling isn't constant, but happens in phases.  Is that correct?  It can be a difficult cycle, to do really well and then fall really hard.  I wondered why that kept on happening to me, and then I was diagnosed with bipolar.  For me, part of the problem was I didn't feel like I needed to seek help when I was doing well and I wasn't able to seek help when I was low.  Do you think you might be able to talk with a doctor or therapist?  Regardless of where you go next, thank you for talking with us here.  I'm really glad to have you with us.

-A-Unique-User-Name- [info] Speaking from personal experience only... the first medication I took was a SNRI and it triggered a manic episode. I had the same question about whether it was only a s/e of the medication but I was diagnosed with bipolar anyways. About a year later I experienced another manic episode while I wasn't taking any medication. Maybe you have to wait it out to be sure which it is?I think I remember reading somewhere that if it was just a s/e, the manic episode will end pretty quickly after discontinuing the drug, while if it was BP the manic episode may last longer.

Joreggy528 [info] Brain "deterioration" Stage? In 2015 I suffered an unknown disorder that I called "the deterioration." Basically what happened was that I couldn't think or do things correctly. I would forget things in about &lt;10 seconds. At school I couldn't do well because I was in this deterioration stage. My grades dropped from Bs to Ds. This also wasn't just for school. It also happened for less important things such as video games. I would get about 15 kills and 40 deaths. Usually it's the other way around. In sports too, I just could not think straight. When I had to play a position I knew I was familiar with, I couldn't remember what to do when I had to play defensively. What happened? I was diagnosed with bipolar recently, does this have anything to do with my bipolar? [info] None [info] 1453625076

lobotomydave23 [info] February of 2017 I tried to kill myself, was doing drugs before that (cocaine, fentanyl, xanax). Stress of college was really getting to me and I realized I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and I was extremely average. I was in a mental hospital for a week, and barely passed most of my classes that semester. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the meds I was taking made me manic as fuck. I married a guy I knew for a month and a half, and a few months later moved to a random state with him I've never been before and had no resources. We both had no job and relied on my school for money. I flunked out because the stress of school was still too much. I got checked in to another mental hospital because I was a danger to myself again. We got evicted from our apartment and we had to move back home. He was abusive and controlling the entire time and accused me of cheating on him 24/7 (he and my mom were the only people I talked to) and he didn't want me to work because of that. I ended up leaving him and now live with my mom again. My mental illness fucks me up so much that the only job I can keep right now is a live in nanny for my brothers and step brothers. I don't get paid but I live there with no expenses. I have a shit ton of student debt that I have had deferred. I have other debt that I'm just ignoring right now because I can't afford to pay it. I have no money, no job, no car. I'm just living day to day trying to survive. I haven't gotten out of it yet. I'm lucky that I have a loving and supportive family or else I would be homeless.

MistressVelveetaVida [info] Ok I think I might have some perspective on the meds thing at least. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15. It was bad. I'm almost 42.  I've been trying to find meds and combos that work until about 2 years ago when I when to a psychiatrist who did something call a "gene sight" test. Basically they take a cheek swab and send it into this lab and they then send your doc the reports of almost every drug for this and tells you which ones most likely won't work, ones you should not take, ones most likely to work and if the levels of medication you're on is too high, too low or just right. I was very surprised with the results, my doc ended up changing a few doses of my meds, stopping some and trying ones from the list of most likely to help. I cannot express how much this has changed my quality of life. Have a sit down with your doc and lay ot all on the table. You may require inpatient treatment for a short period of time to safely change medications. I wish you the best of luck [info] None [info] 1571364479
thumper5 [info] I'm 25. As for how I've changed... I used to be severely depressed, and when I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was a mess and a half. I tried to kill myself 5 years ago in April. I was an extremely angry person. I had very little respect for myself, or anyone else around me. I was selfish. Generally speaking, I just wasn't a very good person.  In the past five years, I've found a... serenity, maybe? I don't know. I very rarely get angry anymore, I go out of my way to be kind, I'm a good friend, I'm no longer medicated. I think I'm the best person I've ever been. [info] ♀ [info] 1420734382
cheweduptoothpick [info] I'm 40, diagnosed at 36 after an incorrect diagnosis of bipolar when I was 16. I am a master of masking and by the time I was diagnosed with bipolar,  could have already won an Oscar for my acting ability although I had no interest in acting at all. I was operating from a place of making people comfortable. I had so much confusion about social tradition, dating and everything that I just emulated people around me.  My parents were extremely supportive of my quirks, my brothers too,  he is undiagnosed however definitely autistic, and my father also. I basically just tried to not be too weird. I have hyperlexia and my grades at school were great,  but my behaviour was poor so schooling was a seesaw. I hated clothes and would try to wear as little as possible, except in winter as I'm super sensitive to cold. My brother and I both couldn't have the seams of our socks touching us,  his ears were supersensitive and my stims are making noises so we triggered each other into meltdown a lot (my poor Mam). Getting an actual diagnosis has helped me by being able to know my limits and remove myself from situations that are too intense for me. My workplace is supportive,  although it's rife with mental illness so nothing is taboo.  [info] None [info] 1536563198
space_impala [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 in May, but at the time I was living alone in apartment by myself. I wasn’t physically taking care of myself and my psychiatrist thought it would be a good idea for me to get an ESA because it’s something I would have to take care of and it would also calm me down when I have manic episodes. I moved back home, went off my medications, and am doing much better, but my cat is now mostly for when I experience those episodes. My mom lives about 30 minutes from where the house will be, so not terribly far. I just have to be aware of when my episodes are coming.  [info] None [info] 1548978187
Rambling_Turtle [info] Do you feel too reliant on your meds? Anyone else feel like their medication controls them, or is this something everyone feels at one time or another? So a bit of background: when I was diagnosed with bipolar my doctor said I could choose medication or try CBT first...I opted to take the lamotrigine as I have tried CBT before and it ended up with me in a very dark place and I was ready to just get on with my life, after discussing this history he agreed this was for the best.Since I have been taking my meds  I feel an improvement and my partner sees it too. BUT I can't help but listen to the voice in my head which is telling me I am reliant on my medicine and without it I'm useless and crazy. So I ended up not taking them for a couple days and spiralling straight into a manic episode... My partner noticed and got me back to taking my pills.. but that voice won't go..What do I do?? Also...first time posting here so sorry if this is the wrong place 😭 [info] None [info] 1578005533
rhondapiper [info] Feeling things and expressing that you felt things was discouraged in my house too.  I love my parents, flaws and all, but each of them came from fucked up families and it's evident in how they behave.  I was just thinking about this on my drive home today- how I've been diagnosed with bipolar, and how it is supposedly a chemical imbalance (though they don't seem to know that for sure), but that I have this fractured family history that must have something to do with my damaged relationship with the world and with living in it.  If I claim my family's behavior is due to their history, to what degree should I say that about myself?I don't know.  Obviously. [info] None [info] 1357183329

iRoastaJWhenIWakeUp [info] Philosophy. Medication is all about differing responsibility for yourself to a drug. Therapy is about expecting someone else to make your life better. It's all about taking responsibility for yourself.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and took medication and received therapy. First, how do you even diagnose someone with a mental illness? With physical illness, there's a clearly defined norm to point to i.e. 98.6 degree Fahrenheit, x many ccs of mucous coming out of their nose, etc. With mental illness, what's the norm? You'll quickly realize that there isn't one. It's all arbitrary. And yet they'll prescribe hard drugs like amphetamines and antidepressants (in my case, "mood stabilizers") to people who they can't even definitively say have something wrong with them. In my opinion, you're better off learning how to live and fixing your own problems in living rather than relying on someone or something to make your life better for you [info] None [info] 1517812949
quanell [info] This happened to me, and I wrote about it not too long ago in this same subreddit. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/tuak1/its_been_6_months_of_steady_progress_and/)Basically, I had been messing around with weed and magic mushrooms for too long, about 2 to 3 years, and had become really introverted and a bit of a social outcast. If you do any drugs as well, STOP AT ONCE. Paranoia and loneliness often manifest themselves in auditory hallucinations!The important thing to remember, which I wish I had, is that you were completely fine in this regard at an earlier point in your life, and it's very much possible to pick yourself back up.For what it's worth, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II) WITH psychotic tendencies.Lastly, I myself became convinced that the thought broadcasting was real, because the voices in my head would always go "It's real!". Fuck that, IT'S NOT REAL.After being completely sober for almost 2 years, I don't have auditory hallucinations anymore, due to a mix of going back to school, getting steady work, and building up a close circle of friends who didn't want to throw their lives in favour of getting high/fucked up.

It's really happier and easier for both of us.If she goes to a doctor, no matter what the issue, it will help her to feel better with herself, and you to stand by her for any help she needs.

firecrackerdingo [info] Telling Parents when they visit I haven't broken it to my parents (well, mom.) that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few months ago. Honestly I'm having a hard time with it myself and I feel bad for keeping it from her but honestly I'm not sure if I can tell her.Some background on this- my mother was diagnosed with bipolar but always denied it, and growing up with her not getting help was not the best to be honest. She still denies it to this day. My dad was a drug addict and died when I was young, long story short. My mom is very much so against medications like antidepressants and such, but I'm on medications for my bipolar.I'm scared that my mother will find my meds and take them away or something. (I'm 21 and live across the state) She's been known to do crazy shit like that.It doesn't help that my current medications aren't helping due to being wrongfully diagnosed as depressed at first. I was on zoloft for over six months before my psych cut me off and had me go straight to abilify and lamictal. So I've been out of it. I worry that she will notice how out of it I am when she comes to visit for the holiday and something will happen, I'm not sure what. Or nothing could happen, and I could still feel like crap for being so groggy I can't enjoy the time I have with my family. [info] None [info] 1479875391

LeafyQ [info] My mom refused to take me for ADHD testing as a kid, although it was recommended over and over. She convinced me that it didn’t exist. I struggled a lot in school, even though I really loved it and I’m not a stupid person. I got by, but college took a couple of attempts, and my GPA is piss poor. I spent my entire school life super stressed out about my performance, and I spent hours and hours every day just to keep up. I want to go to grad school, but I really don’t think I’ll get into any programs. I’ve now been diagnosed with ADHD, and on Adderall I’m a much, much higher performing individual, but I think it’s too late for me to change my life. She also would never take me for any kind of mental health evaluation. Since I was a teen, I’ve gone through long periods of horrible emotional struggles and more. I also had periods where I was doing really, really well. I won’t go into detail, but a few years back I was diagnosed with bipolar I. Lots of therapy and medication later, and I’m just so much more stable.  [info] None [info] 1553031579
poopscoopmcgee [info] Heh thanks! It has been a long, painful, almost deadly road.I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 20. I think I've had it since I was 11 though. That's the first time I remember wanting to die. It took until I was about 28 to finally feel like I had a good grip on everything, so about 8 years from diagnosis. Within that 8 years was 3 suicide attempts, about a month in hospitals, and months of group therapy, as well as 3 different individual therapists. Hmm, has anything stuck out from therapy... one time in group therapy, we had to write a sentence about everyone in the group. We ended up being a pretty tight group so this wasn't awkward really. Someone described me as "a mighty little giant," because I'm such a strong person in a little body. And for some reason that meant the world to me. That group in particular did wonders for me. I was in it for 7 weeks and I feel that it kind of got me to the next stage of recovery. The best things I've taken from therapy is that it gives me perspective- a professional is there to tell me when I'm being ridiculous or when it's actually not me, it's them- mostly that second part. I would fault myself for everything, even things completely out of my control. She was able to get me to see how that wasn't the truth. That and when they say you have to change your thought patterns, you have to change how you talk to yourself- it's true. I thought that was a bunch of shit for years but when I actually started to do it, it made a difference. I mean it still sounds like psychobabble to me but it works. Here is how I know I've made it "to the other side." Whenever something bad would happen to me (for instance, my boyfriend dumped me out of the blue and then i lost my job a couple days later) I would fall apart. After that particular incident though, something clicked in my head. I can't control other people, and I barely can control how I react to things, but I have to work with what I can control. So I made a very conscious effort to control how I react. It's hard sometimes, but that has also made a big difference. Honestly, what helped the most was finally getting stability- a job that didn't fire me, learning to love myself and be comfortable with being single. Then add being really good at that job and working for someone who understands mental illness, and it gives a good foundation to work from. I hadn't had that until 2014. Sorry for the wall of text! I'm happy to answer any questions. Don't beat yourself for not being 'on the other side.' Also, and I never forget this- I could end up back on the other side, no matter how hard I try not to. This is a disease and it will come roaring back from time to time. I can only do my best to deal with it, and if I falter, I have built a support circle to catch me and help me. I'm grateful I have that, because a lot of people don't.  [info] None [info] 1452903687

Anakin_Groundcrawler [info] Concerta questions Four years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have successfully overcome that obstacle, for the most part. Recently, I was also diagnosed with ADHD. I had symptoms that, in hindsight, I was kind of stupid not to notice, but all the same I've begun treatment, so I guess that's all that matters. Anyway, tried straterra and had to quit that a month in because it was really messing with my mood disorders, for example, I had about two emotional breakdowns and I rarely cry any other time. My doctor took me off that and put me on 18mg of concerta and it seemed to do fine. He was afraid with it being a stimulant that it would affect my manic episodes, but thankfully I've been pretty stable as far as my mood goes. Anyway, as far as concentration goes, it was a little better, but ultimately once I notice I'm "concentrating" I then start congratulating myself and think about how awesome it is, and before I know it ten minutes has passed of me day dreaming. So it's been working in spurts, but nothing too much. Went for another visit yesterday, and he increased the dosage to 27mg. So my basic question is, will this ultimately improve my concentration? I think I found a good medicine as far as stable moods go, but am afraid it won't have any affect on me and I'll have to go from square 1. Anyway, sorry if this is a wall of text, I've never really posted on mobile so I'll try to make any necessary revisions whenever I'm back onto my laptop. Thanks, guys! TL;DR: Just upped concerta, will I finally be able to concentrate? [info] None [info] 1384031491
Couldawg [info] Please. [Read the transcript](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2018/10/11/kanye-west-donald-trump-and-jim-brown-the-full-transcript/). Forget right-vs-left. Here are some of the points he makes: **1) Cops and Blacks are both victims, being driven towards each other by the system:** &gt; And that’s a major thing about racial tension. And we also, as black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we’re doing. We kill each other more than police officers. And that’s not saying that the police officer is not is not an issue, because they are in a place — a position of power. But sometimes they’re in a place of law enforcement. They need to be law-power. It’s force versus power. And when you — you shouldn’t have to force people to do that. So a lot of times the police officer is sitting there, they’re being forced to do this and forced to do that block. And then they force somebody into something and force into something. Cops are told to "clean up the streets." So they do. They arrest Blacks for crimes, and into the system they go. Once there, they are marked with a record and a Scarlet P (probation), and turned back out. Things don't look good from there...**2) 13th Amendment as a "trapdoor"**&gt; There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship.The 13th amendment abolished slavery. What is this "trapdoor" he's talking about? READ IT: &gt; Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,** shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.Maybe he has a point? The 13th didn't abolish *all* slavery, only *illegal* slavery. *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*... it's right there. Look at the prison system. Loaded with people, most of them Black. You might say, "that's not slavery, that's prison." I refer you to the Scarlet P from above... **probation**. [4.5 million](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2018/04/26/probation_update-2/) are on probation or parole. We are accustomed to viewing that as a *good* thing... after all, they are getting a "break," since they *could* be in prison. But let's change up our perspective here. Why is prison the default? Honestly... because we don't have anything better. Right? &gt; "Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave."Is he wrong? He's talking about how petty bullshit spirals into a lifelong sentence, unless you have the education and/or resources to tread above it. Is that not the crux of the Black Lives Matter argument?&gt; "Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons."In other words, if I've done my time, then get the damn chain off my ankle.**3) The Role of Mental Illness in All These Problems**&gt; "And I think it would be cool to have Yeezy ideation centers, which would be a mix of education that empowers people and gives them modern information like — sometimes people say, “This kid has ADD. This kid has ADD.” He don’t have ADD. School is boring. It was boring. It’s not as exciting as this. We have to make it more exciting. We have to mix curriculums. You play basketball while you’re doing math. You learn about music while you meditate in the morning. We have to instate mental health and art programs back into the city."&gt; "We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. **So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation,** which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name."&gt; And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.After Kanye left the White House, the MSM pounced on the meeting calling him crazy and unhinged, *while referencing his prior mental health issues.* They repeatedly referenced his alleged bipolar diagnosis. But wait... is that even true? Or was it sleep deprivation? Does it even matter? If so, why? If it wasn't bipolar disorder, does he now have to *disprove* that it was? What kind of BS is that? Also... Kanye gets a LOT of flak for all the self-promotion and braggadocio. But what is the theme? This isn't the typical  "sting-like-a-bee" rhetoric you hear from athletes, or "bitches-n-hoes" boasts you hear from a lot of rappers. He's bragging about his intellect. When is the last time you can remember a Black man bragging about his *intellect*? What is the context for his comments? He's talking about education. He's talking about standards. He's talking about Black kids who are bored out of their minds, subject to insulting low academic standards... schools that simply teach from the book, and only care about getting kids in and out. What if inner city schools started with the presumption that their students are *smart*? Why are they all built and operated on the presumption that these kids are one inch away from failure? Why is every student in the inner city schools placed in "intervention mode" from the very start? Maybe if we treat these kids like they can have a bright future, some of them will actually... believe it? Why are distraught young kids in the inner city treated like criminals who simply haven't learned how to shoot? Why is a distraught middle class suburban white kid stuffed with medication and sent to the rainbow room for nappies? Does either system work? At least we talk about the second system for a minute, when someone shoots up a school. Do we *ever* talk about the first system? Nope. We just comfort ourselves with images of [Michelle Pfeiffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ShmAq4sqc), [Jim Belushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9ps--2lySY) or [Hillary Swank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXMJlm852A) or [fucking Meryl Streep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p50UW7zhM4) making it all better, so we can *pretend* that this is what's happening downtown.

Kanye: &gt; "So — and that’s a move. One of the moves that I love that liberals try to do — the liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism, because they know that we are very proud, emotional people. **So when I said “I like Trump” to, like, someone that’s liberal, they’ll say, “Oh, but he’s racist.” You think racism could control me?** Oh, that don’t stop me. That’s an invisible wall." Directly after Kanye says this...... a reporter asks the following: &gt; "But you don’t think — you reject those who say he’s racist?"This reporter... I don't know, man. He didn't even *pretend* to be listening to what Kanye was saying. It's like the reporter just heard "I don't believe... Trump... is racist," and wanted Kanye basically given him a weaponized soundbite. Kanye responds: &gt; "On your question — and you had *one* question; we’re going to do it to another question."The reporter: &gt; (Laughs.) Okay.	 What the hell are you laughing at, dude? Kanye just called out this bullshit, and your impulse is to double down on the *same bullshit*?Take this interaction together with the SNL episode, and Don Lemon's reaction to this interview. If they don't *have* to listen to you, they won't... they'll just shut you off. If they *do* have to listen to you, they'll just nod and smile, but they won't hear what you are saying. Instead of hearing and absorbing, they are positioning and packaging. *How can I lead this towards a bombshell soundbite? How can I use this interaction to talk about George Bush or Brett Kavanaugh, or the electoral college*? The Left comes to the table with talking points, and treats every interaction like a poker match. They are just staring at their cards the whole time, waiting for you to throw down a particular card, so they can lay out their hand. _____Obviously, there is a lot here. One reaction could be to actually listen to him, and take from it what you will. You don't have to worship the guy, or even agree with him. But can we at least make a good faith effort to listen to him, and *try* to hear what he's saying? Another reaction is to write it off completely, as crazy rantings, to avoid any opportunity to discuss *the very same issues* that everyone is talking about... to scroll through the video looking for the "wildest moments," kick out a story about his phone password, kick out another story about how he banged on *the Resolute Desk*, and call it a day.

Cowhaus [info] Possible med change I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 15 years ago. It took 5 years of different medications until I finally found lithium. I have been relatively stable for ten years. Last week, I was given some bad news. I have severe hyperthyroidism, most likely caused from the lithium. Tomorrow, I am going to see an endocrinologist who will be deciding if I need to change meds or if something else can be done. I am terrified. Finding the right meds was the most challenging time of my life. I had awful highs and lows, multiple allergic reactions and my marriage was on the rocks. I am worried that the next few months could be rough. I’m scared to have to learn to be unstable for a while and somehow manage to keep my life in order. I’m really glad I found this subreddit. I feel understood and supported here. Thank you. [info] None [info] 1533782448

lilysimilar [info] Life is good for a change I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for 11 years now.  I was diagnosed in May of 2004 at the age of 14.  In that time, I've been hospitalized four times, and nearly hospitalized at least a dozen more times.  This disorder has caused so much damage in my life, from work, to school, to relationships, to credit, to my body.... just.... awful.Anyway... I've been employed now for 11 continuous months.  It's the longest period I've ever been employed and I'm really proud of myself.Not only that, but I'm living on my own, paying my own bills, and I'm just really thankful that I've been stable enough to do so.I'm starting prerequisites for nursing school starting this fall (maybe this summer).  I have seven courses across three quarters that separate me and nursing school.Surprisingly my grades are good, I've just had to withdraw from so many semesters that it's made me ineligible for financial aid at those institutions.In any case, I've been stable now since 2013, after having a postpartum mixed episode.  Life is good, for a change. [info] None [info] 1432769802

HavartiParty [info] I just woke up so this probably wont be quite as coherent as I would like, but whatever.  I encourage my clients to use "person first language"-instead of saying "I'm bipolar" use "I've been diagnosed with bipolar."  Your diagnosis does not define you, unless you let it.  You're a thousand things that are NOT related to your diagnosis, try defining yourself that way rather than by an illness.  When people are diagnosed with cancer they don't say "I'm cancer" so why is it that we tend to use a mental health diagnosis as a defining characteristic when describing ourselves?  I hope that makes sense, I was up for 1.2 million hours entering DAP notes. :D  [info]  [info] 1396271014
greenbriergoodsire [info] It sounds like you and I have some common ground in experience, though differing degrees I believe. I'm also 23, have been measured as having an above average intellect, and am going to a good school (at least I am now, one more bad semester and I'm calling it). At 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, then at 22 it changed to bipolar I w/psychotic features. About nine months later, I still had quasi-psychotic symptoms and I was told I have StPD, closely related but typically without true hallucinations or bizzarre delusions. The scattered, impossible to "herd" thought problems are still there, so the cognitive issues I definitely get. I get really frustrated with myself with regard to cognitive problems because I feel like I should be able to do it, and my brain is just gonna fail me more and more until people can't understand me at all. Most of the time I get my point across, but stress these past couple weeks has amped up all of that for me.In a general sense I dont know its the same worthlessness, but I am almost incapable of instigating social interaction because I get this picture of whoever it is rolling their eyes and letting the call go to voicemail because my friends don't actually like me, they're just indulging me out of pity. I don't have that self-directed shame or anything, but I do get caught up worrying for like 30-45 minutes that all my friends are eventually going to gradually chip away and I'll have nobody. Those are the hardest for me to handle, because I  can see why others wouldn't be on board with me.As for finding something elevated to channel energy and time into, I've always gone creatively. I write and play bass to unwind, and for purpose in life I have stand-up comedy. That was when I found the "joy in life," when I started writing jokes and realized that the world isn't as odd as I see it, but it's not far off. There's also something to be said for looking for reasons to laugh, even passively. If there's anything you used to do that you head just clicked with and you understood viscerally, pursue that. It may give you a good flotation device. [info] None [info] 1467796720

Like you, I research everything about it, and also price check it ten times over, and spend months before I make the decision.The only times I've spent money was when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my medications made it worse, to the point where I was ALWAYS manic.

thogervo [info] Constant inner monologue? Hey folks,I've been diagnosed with bipolar II, and when I feel I'm in a hypomanic episode I sometimes feel as if I have an inner monologue that cannot be stopped. It feels similar to the typical 'quick thoughts' of mania, but it's usually in my own inner narrative or augmented with little tidbits of songs that have been stuck in my head.It can get unbelievably distracting, and it seems to be more likely to happen if I sleep poorly the night before... Or (and this is odd) if I've been intensively reading books that have many characters. For example, I recently finished A Song of Ice And Fire and throughout the books, after reading for extended periods of time, I would (involuntarily)  invent new dialogues for the characters or keep a running dialogue going, in my head, of what certain characters had said with typical responses by other characters.Anyone have any similar experiences?

My husband on the other hand has always been supportive, from the very moment he realized that something was wrong.

I was diagnosed with bipolar in April after 10 years of symptoms that the NHS ignored but that's a whole other rant.Monday/Tuesday the shit hit the fan and I was arrested and placed in custody. My highly unstable brain thought I was being kidnapped by demons so I fought like hell. Back up was called. 6 men versus my 5ft 8, 130ish pound frame. I fought so hard my entire body hurts and there are bruises everywhere. In cells they also decided to remove my pyjamas so of course I had no underwear on. Oh god I lost my shit.

I have no experience in psychology, I'm diagnosed with bipolar II with psychotic features (but pretty sure I am schizoaffective, I've been experiencing psychotic episodes since childhood).

The Moon; luna, lunatic, crazy. Secret shadows in the mind. I've seen the lunar effect when I worked in the nursing homes.

bye_now [info] Ex "diagnosed" me  My (very recent) ex-boyfriend started reading the book, “Walking on Eggshells”, on the recommendation of his therapist. I have seen the book title come up in many BPD and BDP S/O forums so I decided to check it out. I was diagnosed with bipolar II a year ago and have been working on my own to work on myself in and my relationship to my diagnosis. Maybe a week or so before our breakup, my ex came to me and said that he thought (or let’s say he was absolutely convinced), based on the book and reddit forums on BPD, that I have BPD as well as or instead of bipolar. At the time, I broke down and accepted everything he said as fact and my head spun into a flurry of “wow, I really am the problem, so many things are wrong with me and I make his life hell” thoughts. He noted that I would forget things that one of us had said (in my opinion we had major communication issues where we had two VERY different perspectives of/assumptions about what was said in discussions), that I was irrational about...well, everything, and on and on and on (more examples below). Upon reflection - and in speaking with my therapist - I truly don’t believe I have BPD. My ups and downs were absolutely there and no picnic for either of us. However, we were moving for the 3rd time in 5 months and in trying to set up our home together, I felt that the “together” part didn’t exist. To quote him, “Why do you always have to say something? Why can’t you just let me do it (set up a room) and shut up?” He said that I manipulated him, that nothing he did was ever good enough, and that I was trying to control and criticize everything he did. Those feelings paired with things he read led him to the conclusion that I had BPD. Do I have things to work on? Yes. We all do. However, it bothers me to my core that, in his mind, his black-and-white thinking and his own need for control (he doesn’t think so but he has occasionally debilitating OCD) and belief that we shouldn’t “dwell in our feelings but should detach and move on” in no way contributed to our demise. I was told that I isolated him from friends he never reached out to, that I kept him from doing things he wanted - like going to the gym he never took time to go to or play with the puppy he clearly didn’t have time for -, and that I ruined his mental health and happiness. I guess in this long lost, I’m trying to figure out if my even writing this is a “sign” or “symptom” of BPD or am I just coming to the realization that I was (apologies for the phrasing but I can’t think of anything else) driving myself crazy and talking myself into believing I had undiagnosed issues/illnesses because he said so?If anything, I needed to get all of this out and am working on realistically processing my emotions from multiple viewpoints (not just mine, my family’s, or my therapist’s). Any type of...anything...would be greatly appreciated! [info] None [info] 1566758845

amrezo [info] I created a free AI-powered iOS app for individuals with bipolar such as myself! Hello everyone, About a decade ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and life hasn't been the same to say the least. The constant ups and downs have majorly disrupted many parts of my life (and unfortunately still do to this day). I do coding on the side as a hobby and started to wonder if there was a bipolar-focused app out there that can help serve as a companion to my illness (track medication, moods, overall wellness). There is a number of options out there (Daylio, eMoods, etc.) but I still felt something was lacking. My brother who's currently doing a master's in psychology taught me that bipolar affects a number of physiological markers such as willingness to exercise, duration of sleep, food intake and overall social connectedness. As someone who went through all these symptoms, I wanted to build an app that would also monitor these wellness factors as well as daily moods and medication.The result is Companion. Companion is a free iOS app that lets your track your medication intake, daily wellness (sleep, exercise, food intake, and sociality) as well as regular daily mood tracking. The idea behind tracking daily wellness factors is that when you start to see a decline or rise in specific factors, it can alarm you to an impeding episode (whether depressive or manic), and help shift your mood early on. Something interesting I've implemented is a daily wellness score that uses machine learning to keep track of your indicators and provide and overall score from 0 - 100.Let me know what you think, would love to get some feedback on it :)Download it here:[Companion iOS Bipolar Mood tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/companion-bipolar-mood-tracker/id1504120100?ls=1) [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1585058547

asocialwarrior [info] Hi there! I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, but my symptoms had been visible a year earlier. Uni wasn't difficult until my very last year (this academic year), and my downward spiral started last semester when I was dealing with a sad break up. Towards the end of last semester, I was very bad and decided to stop taking my meds because I felt like they weren't "curing" me after all these years (which was a huge lie that my illness persuaded me into swallowing because I had been stabilised since being on meds). I was well-surrounded and always have been, but gosh I was a pain in the arse to deal with. I was hurt and had a hard time trusting people, even my closest friends and my family. I refused to be fished out of the abyss. I started drinking just so I could pass out instead of sobbing myself to sleep. I started smoking so that I could just feel something. I stopped booking and going to my psychiatric appointments. And guess what? It was the dumbest decision my whole life! I realised how much it was affecting me and my trust circle. Everything was shit. My depressive episode was way longer than my hypomanic phase and I couldn't bear it. I wanted so badly to feel joy again, even if it was just two seconds. This semester has been shitty and my marks have suffered because of my stubbornness. I ended up being transported to Montreal Gen for suicidal ideationat some point. I have however recently resumed my meds (switched from Seroquel XR to IR) and seeing my psychiatrist, in addition to seeing a therapist for the first time my entire life. I have never been better honestly, but I have just realised that I started recovering at the very last moment of my BA. Somehow I have stopped caring about my grades and academic performance. I don't know why. Grades used to matter a lot to me and I would just fight until my last breath to get the grade I wanted/thought I deserved. But somewhere in my struggle, I lost my interest in everything and got on my way to recovery land at the very end. I don't regret the late realisation/recovery though. I know right now I'm standing in a war zone, but I'm happy to finish my degree and I'm happy with myself. I'm happy to have learnt to take care of myself, even though it's just very simple things. Just remember that you have the agency to choose to get out of the mess. It's okay to make baby steps and it's okay to fall the first few times. I know McGill can be ruthless and unhelpful and sometimes you have to seek outside help (Suicide Action saved my life, but you can also call crisis centres like Le Transit or Tracom - Le Transit has been particularly great in my experience). Free group therapies at Revivre or Maison St Jacques are also great resources if you speak French, or if you're on Blue Cross insurance, you could use Empower Me which is a free 24/7 counselling resource (http://studentcare.ca/rte/en/McGillUniversityundergraduatestudentsSSMU_EmpowerMe_EmpowerMe).

pipette_on [info] Bipolar and Getting Healthy (Help) Hi all,I know variations of this topic have been posted before, but I feel like they have revolved around eating disorders and I’m not quite looking for feedback from that realm. I am being discharged from a partial hospitalization program for mental illness on Thursday after being in it for three weeks. In this program, we were fed all three meals and had snacks available to eat during the day, so pretty much everything we needed was provided for us. I was diagnosed with bipolar II and started taking the proper medications about two weeks ago now, but it will still take a bit of time for the meds to really sit in. After a lot of treatment and a diagnosis, I realized that the biggest reason why I have struggled with my weight is because I behave so differently between my highs and lows.In my highs, I’m working out and have no issues with counting calories because honestly, I’m not that hungry. The tricky thing here though, is that because I’m not hungry, I have no problem going from “1500 cals? Let’s do 1200! No 1000! No 800!” which obviously isn’t healthy. Once when I was on anti depressants and taking them consistently, I lost 50 lbs in about three months. (If you’re bipolar and take antidepressants, they can push you into mania).In my lows though, I struggle with binge eating and using food as a way to punish myself sometimes. I used to purge sometimes but it hasn’t really been a thing.  I struggle especially because I can’t really differentiate between being hungry or full. I talked to the nutritionist about this, and the hope is that when I’m stabilized, I’ll be able to make rational, reasonable decisions. She also suggested I start eating 3 meals and two snacks a day in small quantities to help bring back my full/hungry signals.  The thing I’m most worried about though, is that I’ve realized that I don’t really know what reasonable is because I haven’t really experienced it. There is also a part of me that fears that if I start counting calories again I’ll start doing what I used to do and decrease my limit more and more. I also am trying to get into a normal workout routine, but again, reasonably. I guess I’m just looking for advice on how to go about fitness reasonably, especially with mental health issues too. I’m 5’6” and weigh about 220 lbs and I really want to be strong and fit again because I used to be an athlete and didn’t start gaining a ton of weight until I was 22. I’m 26 now.Thanks.

thelastplaceyoulook [info] O.o weird. Yeah-- I was diagnosed with bipolar, and I guess other antidepressants can trigger that, too. So my psych wanted to try generic Wellbutrin (whatever the name is) and even the introductory dose seriously effed me up. It could have been the stress of that that triggered a flare-up, but it's bizarre that I'm not the only one that had an MS reaction to that. [info] None [info] 1503188540
ashalisig17 [info] I've actually been wanting to get this off of my chest. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (annoying ass mood swings) nearly a year ago, and I'm on a medication that has stabilized my mood swings. My psychiatrist told my parents that it explains why I would sometimes be unnecessarily irritable, and it made a lot of sense. My mom has taken this is as "every time she's mad, it's just the crazy talking". I don't remember why, but a month or so ago we had started arguing about something on our way home, and my sister (who was in the car with us, but didn't know what happened) asked my mom why I was angry. My mom responded with "it's just that time of the month" and did that hand gesture of twirling her finger next to her head implying that I was crazy. Maybe this isn't a huge deal but it really hurt my feelings that my mom doesn't take my feelings seriously just because I have a mental disorder. She's "apologized" but I know there wasn't any meaning behind it, my mom never thinks she's at fault for anything. I say "apologized" since she only said sorry because my dad told her she should, she didn't actually care. [info] None [info] 1559416215

ellivia [info] &gt;She stated that I was suffering from a mental disorder such as bipolar or some other thing she mentioned I can't recall.The only mental disorder that I could even remotely see causing anyone to have gender identity issues would be schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  These cause delusional thoughts and hallucinations and could probably fuck with you on occasion.  I've been diagnosed with bipolar type I although I'm pretty sure I actually have schizoaffective disorder (long story, don't tell my psychiatrist everything, should prolly fix that, etc) and I often have to reassure myself that it isn't my mental disorders causing my identity issues, it is entirely separate.As far as I know, no mental disorder has ever caused a person to believe that they are a different gender from their assigned sex, at least not for prolonged periods of time where they actually felt they needed to transition.  I think that mental disorders may be common among trans* folk, but I don't think it is a cause.Either way, there's no sufficient evidence that would show any type of correlation.  Your mother is making shit up to make her feel better instead of just accepting the truth.Edit: Just to throw it out there, my mom did the same thing.  I actually am diagnosed with mental disorders and my mom initially said the same.  My dad did as well, although he actually just doesn't talk about it and refuses to. [info] None [info] 1381100672

hippiehen54 [info] Three doctors have said bipolar pretty much means you have bipolar disorder. Think about bipolar just like you would if they said you have diabetes. Take the meds=controlling the disorder. Stop the meds=the disorder will control you. I've had b/p disorder since I was in my teens. No one diagnosed anything until I was in my late twenties when they put me on a tricyclic med. It wasn't until I was in my early 50s that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I never talked to the doctor when I was ecstatic or full of energy. Only when I was depressed. Now we know the anti depressants triggered mania. A lot of the meds today weren't developed back in my early years of treatment.I still have times where I decide to do something that later doesn't make sense And I still can't forgive myself for choices I made even when I can clearly see the influence of the disorder. I can't cut myself any slack.  [info] None [info] 1514602781
perkelemofo [info] Get help. It doesn't have to be like this.I used to be angry, like you. I used to hate everyone, and everything. I spent my days dreaming about suicide, and hurting others. I thought up plans to kill myself, kill strangers, kill my family. I was panicked, angry, depressed, and self-loathing. I would cut myself, punch myself, and cry until I threw up. My panic attacks prevented me from sleeping. I knew I wouldn't make it to 16. I was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and tried medication after medication, but it made no real difference. Every second of living felt like torture, like a horrible mistake, and I slogged through the pain until I could find the right time to kill myself.My mom found something I wrote, angry and hateful like your post, suggesting violence and self harm. She called my psychiatrist. I talked to her for over an hour, and she peeled away the layers; all the things I'd never told her. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and put on Lithium. I railed against it at first, and hated how it made me feel, but I think within the angry, hateful teenager was a scared little girl who just desperately wanted to get better - so I took the pills obediently.Within a few months I was a different person. It evened out my emotions, calmed the anger, and banished my panic attacks. The black cloud suffocating my life began to dissipate, and I rediscovered myself: a person I had forgotten existed, who didn't hate and resent life, no, she even thrived on it. I relearned what it was like to sleep through the night without being kept awake by panic attacks. I relearned what it was like to enjoy the company of other people. I relearned what it was like to not hate myself, and begin to recognize my own worth. I relearned what it was like to see beauty in the world.It doesn't have to be like this. You're young, and you probably grew into these feelings, as I did, and it's probably all you've known as you've grown into self-awareness and emotional maturity. I know you probably can't imagine any other existence than the one you're experiencing right now, and it seems like the only outlet is death. I know it may sound unbelievable to you right now, as it did to me 10 years ago, but you *can get better*. Go see someone who can prescribe medication. Don't hold back, tell them everything you've been experiencing. Any psychiatrist worth their salt will hear you out and take you seriously - if they don't, find someone who does.It's not an easy trek on the road to serenity and self acceptance, but such a road does exist for you, as it did for me. Please get help. You deserve to feel better, and you can feel better, if you take the right steps; the hard part is discovering what that is for you, but once you do, god, is it worth it.If you ever want anyone to talk to, or at, please send me a message. I've been where you are, and I know the horror and bleakness of it. I want you to see sunshine again, and realize that the world is okay. I want you to find peace within yourself. You can get better.

When I was diagnosed with diabetes all my friends and family were there to support me and help me. When I was diagnosed with bipolar no one came to support me through it. In fact most stopped associating with me entirely because I was labeled "Crazy" or whatever. Even after being stable for years I can't escape that stigma.

Irvingthrowaway [info] It did take me a while to figure out what to do for fun when I wasn't drinking.  Basically I figured out that my friends still enjoy going out to dinner, playing board games at home, etc.  I still enjoy the hobbies I had before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  It depends on where you live and what you enjoy, but there are lots of outdoor things that you can enjoy without drinking.  Hiking, biking, skiing, (or whatever things you're interested in).  Another cool thing about not going out drinking is that I'm able to stick to a regular sleep schedule and that's better for my moods too.  Regular sleep is a HUGE part of maintaining my stability.Also, when I have fun now, I remember all of it and I don't regret doing dumb things that I don't remember doing.

scoobitywoop [info] I don’t want to take my meds I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 years ago. I was put on medication and I never felt happy, I felt like I was watching everyone around me go through life and I was out of touch so I stopped taking them. I hated that feeling of never really being happy. I also couldn’t cry so I felt like I couldn’t be sad either, and sometimes you just need a good cry ya know? I eventually stopped going to therapy too, I didn’t like different meds being pushed on me or being told to try other ones. I love myself now and I feel much more happy. Sometimes my emotions can get the best of me but I have definitely found what works (most of the time) for me. Bipolar has such a harsh stigma so no one knows that I have it and even fewer know I’m unmedicated. Though medication works for some I hated the feeling. And now I can be as happy or as sad as I want and feel the full spectrum of emotions. [info] None [info] 1563486557

TheEpitomeOfSin [info] Hiding PTSD from my family? I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder a year ago when I was 21, I'm 22 now was still struggling with issues not related to the bipolar, so I went back to my behavioral specialist to discuss.1 week ago today I was diagnosed with complex PTSD due to a combination of emotional abuse as a child and a serious sexually physically and verbally abusive relationship when I was in college. I never told anyone not even my best friend about just how toxic this relationship was so no one knew except for me and him. And even still This diagnosis came as a shock to me. Because I never thought I could be diagnosed with PTSD...When I was diagnosed with bipolar I kept it hidden from my family for awhile due to them invalidating my mental health struggles frequently. I was prescribed prazosin for the PTSD and I totally forgot about it when I asked my mom to pick up my prescriptions. She asked what i needed it for since it's commonly a blood pressure medication, and I instinctively  lied and told her it was for sleep problems.I hate lying to my family I walk around feeling so guilty... but I also don't want them to know about my relationship history. And if I tell them I was diagnosed because of my childhood trauma they'll say I'm exaggerating and being dramatic.., so now I don't know what to do... do I tell them? Do I just keep it hidden?

Ravido-the-Clown [info] Lamotrogine withdrawal Hi! I’m new to this reddit.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2 years ago. I haven’t really talked to anybody I’m close with extensively about it. Never really related to anyone regarding how I function, so I feel kind of like the black sheep in the herd.To the main part of this post:I started on lamotrogine about a year ago (400mg).It works decently, nowhere close to fixing anything but I guess that’s to be expected.Sometimes I forget to take my medicine (I take it morning and before I go to bed, 200mg per)I’ve been browsing around the internet for withdrawal symptoms, but there isn’t really anything stating something substantial happens. Here’s what happens to me (this is consistant with every time I forget to take the medicine)Whenever I miss both the morning and night doses, an awful feeling starts crawling in. I start to feel more and more sluggish, my balance is weakened, when I stand or walk I feel a pushing or pressure on my chest, breathing becomes heavy and I am overall dizzy. My vision also becomes ‘blurry’ of some sorts, not badly but enough that I feel there’s something wrong in the vision department. Normal functions like forming sentences becomes difficult.These symptoms worsen rapidly over time bit by bit until I take my medicine again. Every time this happens it gets severe enough to the point that I have to ask someone to drive me to the closest 24/7 pharmacy. I’m on the verge of being too dizzy to walk by myself at all. It’s like my brain just shuts down incrementally. It feels like slowly losing brain function I guess you could say.Are there anyone else on here with similar experiences? I assumed this was normal until I looked it up.(Edit) Thanks for the responses! [info] None [info] 1551251844
pickleb1tch [info] Hypomania and False Hope r/Bipolar: “Is there anyone present who is making their first post or has been diagnosed in the last 30 days? If so, please introduce yourself.” Me: *stands up* Hey everyone, I’m pickleb1tch, and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I’ve been trying to manage, but it’s getting hard. I’m on meds, but they’re being adjusted and that’s a process. I used to love my hypomania. With the small caveat of mild insomnia, loss of appetite, and wanting to do everything at once thus getting nothing done, it’s a pretty good time. The world seems beautiful and I feel euphoric. I become more creative and productive. Being around people makes me happy and I seek company. Conversations become more meaningful and memorable. Lately, I feel as if being hypomanic contributed to me doing things “normal” me wouldn’t do. Hypomania let me feel capable and as if I mattered a bit more than I did. Think very mild delusions. Among the things I wouldn’t normally do: A friend (A) had confided in me about troubles regarding her friend (B). I hadn’t been present in either of their lives for almost 2 years for various reasons. So I went ahead and made a long but gentle text to B about maybe considering talking to a professional about problems A mentioned - without telling A that I texted B. A texted me, clearly upset, and I hadn’t grasped the gravity or the sensitivity of the topic. It was something between the two of them and I had breached their trust. I was way out of line. I had been absent for 2 years and thought I could butt in and fix things like a glowing ethereal fairy whose words of wisdom would magically make all things well. I thought I had a connection with them that had clearly been far weaker than I perceived, but thought I was doing a good thing. Writing that text felt like I was genuinely helping, like it would change things: more so than I normally would and looking back at the text I sent to B makes my insides curdle. Like Reggae says, “it wasn’t me”.You might think “ok, it’s just one text to your friends what’s the big deal?” For me, a lot was at stake. I hadn’t been there for a long while and was still testing the waters. I had no friends when I came back, and I desperately needed friends. It felt like I kinda had to make good impressions else I’d lose them forever. I know this is super mild compared to the severity of others’ mania, but for me it’s new and scary. When I realized what I had done with some semblance of sanity, I just sobbed and screamed in the car for this to “go away, leave me alone, make it stop.”So please, if you’ve made it this far, a bit of advice about grounding yourself during mania would be greatly appreciated.

Hurricane_Potato [info] Am I [20F] a toxic partner to my boyfriend [25M]? Edi: Cross posting to r/relationshipsSo this is a bit of a strange post because it's not really a particular situation per se... Essentially I'm trying to deconstruct whether or not my behaviour is normal.For some context, prior to dating my current boyfriend, I had a pretty toxic abusive ex. This is all pretty important because since I'm young and it was my first relationship, I didn't really know what was and wasn't normal. So my ex used to coerce me into having sex, sometimes anal (you can check my post history for that). He lived about 1 hour drive away from me, and he came over every weekend despite me sometimes asking him not to because i was busy for school. We had dated for about 1.5 years. Whenever we had an argument, he would always say, "I see where you're coming from, but..." and then keep pressing on with "But isn't it reasonable for me to feel x way in y situation?"So it was a lot of emotional manipulation (probably something he wasn't aware of). He would also text me constantly throughout the day during our relationship, and I wouldn't always respond. I felt really pressured to constantly give him my undivided attention at all times. So he would take up my weekends (Usually Friday evening until Monday at noon), text me constantly, and sometimes he came over during the week as well. The weeks that he didn't come, I was expected to make a trek up to his town, which was a 3 hour bus ride from where I was.So that's the context for my question. My current boyfriend is wonderful. We've been dating about maybe 4, 5 months now? He's really kind to me and he's respectful of my boundaries. I think he enjoys spending time with me as much as I enjoy spending time with him. He lives about an hour's bus ride away from me, and he hasn't been over to my place because I have a cat (that he's allergic to). We try to see each other about once a week, sometimes once every two weeks.Here's my problem. I feel like I'm being what my ex was like to me, if that makes sense. I message him a lot during the day, usually just a meme or an update on something happening in my life. I don't always expect a response or anything more than a "lol" or "wtf", but I also don't always get a response... When I tell him that I love him, I don't always get an I love you back, and he's never the first one to say it. I'm trying to understand it as different love languages, but I find myself doubting that he really likes me? Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable saying it because he doesn't return the sentiment?And I seem to want to spend time with him more than he wants to spend time with me... When we make plans to hang out for a day or so and it gets cancelled, he doesn't seem super disappointed about it. He hasn't started any conversations with me recently and I guess I'm just paranoid. I haven't brought this up with him because sometimes I'll ask him whether he's annoyed with me or if he still likes me and at first he was kind of surprised and would say "yeah, of course." But now when i ask him he just kind of sighs exasperatedly. I'm really paranoid that I'm being unreasonable, but I don't ask him those questions unless I'm feeling super doubtful in the moment, but it really hurts when I keep the question locked up.Am I toxic? Am I being too clingy or controlling? Am I too obsessive about him? It's not like I'm constantly thinking about him, but I do double message occasionally because I basically use dms as Snapchat. I guess I'm not feeling a lot of love from him online, but when we're in person it's usually okay. I think I'm well past the honeymoon phase, but I know I love him for who he is.TL;DR: I had a previous bad relationship experience and I don't know whether me wanting to spend time with my current partner is a sign of me being toxic or not. I feel like I'm being too needy or clingy but at the same time I don't feel like his love is present enough when we're apart. I'm scared of turning into my ex. Any opinions would be helpful.BTW, I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and OCD. I am currently taking medication to get those under control and I am seeing a therapist. I don't know whether these are issues with my disorders or if this is something I should discuss with the s/o [info] None [info] 1579625935
dreamyproject [info] Ooh, I'd like to enter! OK, so my best girl is obviously Honoka. I watched the anime for LLSIF in 2014, around when I first realized something was kind of "off" with me. And it made me cry a lot to see Honoka say the things I was saying to myself ("I'll never be as good as them" re: A-RISE in season one) but then, in the end, with all of her friends by her side, she never gave up. Not long after I watched the anime I was diagnosed with bipolar, and years later I still look up to her a lot because I have she gets me up when I feel lost and down. She's one of my inspirations to never give up, even when I feel the lowest of low, and her shikishi is right across from my bed on my nightstand so I can always look at her to cheer me on with a "faito dayo!" Last two little reasons: I would love that account is because it has a UR Nico and Nico is right behind Honoka in my fav girls! I've never rolled a UR Nico on my main and would love to have her. And despite my ex-dolphin tendencies I don't have an idolized UR on any account I've ever had.The best thing that happened to me in SIF was probably scouting New Years Honoka on my first JP account because UR of best girl! And I love "hatsumoude" themed cards because while I studied abroad in Japan, it was one of the things I really wanted to do. (Unfortunately I lost that account when my phone just decided to dump a whole bunch of data so that's another reason having her idolized would be aces. Thankfully someone was nice enough to trade me an unidolized Taishou Honoka though!)And now that my story is done, I love Ene the most and I played her songs a lot on rhythm games while I was in Japan!

meow_mixxer [info] I am a closet borderliner.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, after a suicide attempt. Sometime in the next couple years, I remember it was changed to borderline personality disorder, then back to bipolar with the next psychiatrist. Fast forward though years of self harm and failed relationships and electric emotions to age 27. (Those years were also filled with college and children and art and other Really Good Things.) I earned a degree in psychology and landed a job in a group home for adults living with mental illness. I don't think I have the correct words to express how much I love my job and my residents. I love being at work equally as much as being home with my children. They are like family. They depend on me and a few other colleagues.... For everything.At any rate, I get a front row seat to the current state of psychiatric care and mental illness in this geographical area. Half promising, half disheartening. I work with some residents who have a BPD diagnosis. Where some of my colleagues see manipulation and evil (yes, I've heard that word used) I see a person wading through their past trauma to get through the day. I see a person aching for love and simultaneously ferociously guarding their heart against hurt. The stigma sticks out like a sore ugly thumb. I see how my colleagues frown disapprovingly at the BPD diagnosis on intake paperwork. I see it.I could go on; I won't.I'm still diagnosed with bipolar disorder, unspecified type. I've never felt that bipolar quite fit me. It's like wearing one shoe that's too big and one that's too small. The only time it really resonated with me was during a brief period after my divorce, when I was abusing alcohol and pills on the daily. Drinking my brains out then taking enough stimulants to keep me up so I could drink more and just sleep the next day or the day after. Of course my moods were wild.Then one day I was browsing the DSM and it hit me; they were right all those years ago, I'm borderline. It all makes sense. All the pieces fit. The more I read, the more thoroughly I'm convinced.However.I don't know if I even feel comfortable talking to my psychiatrist about this. I'm afraid, number one, that she will think it's preposterous that an 18 year diagnosis is incorrect. I'm also afraid she'll look at me differently, treat me differently, trust me less. Is this silly? Maybe. Now, I have spent 18 years becoming comfortable with the bipolar diagnosis and rejecting the shame I felt. I can finally look any doctor or colleague or family member in the eye and mention my bipolar diagnosis without flinching. It feels like starting over.I'm 99% sure that BPD is the correct diagnosis for me.

LazilyGlowingNoFood [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I do not take my medication because I do not like it, and as a result my academic success has fallen since it began to develop out of latency. Many people think that I am extroverted because of how wild I can be sometimes, but its just an affect of my disorder. I'm not quite sure what will happen to me as a result of my refusal to take my medications; both polar moods can provide me with great inspiration and interesting experiences, but it will probably ruin me.

ediesweet [info] I was in a similar situation to your daughter. I was a little younger than her when I was diagnosed with bipolar. To this day my father thinks I am making it up, that bipolar isn't real, and that I'm just mentally weak. Being around him was very upsetting and infuriating for me, because I always considered him intelligent and wise and I couldn't believe he could be so ignorant. I think it's for the best if she doesn't see him until he learns to empathize. I can only speak from my point of view but that is what I did. It seems like your daughter is taking positive steps and is getting better. I think things should stay as is for now. Good luck, you're a great mother! I wish my parents were as accepting and caring as you.  [info] None [info] 1439322384
Swiftley94 [info] Waiting to be refereed back into the mental health services - confused over my state. Hey Everyone,&amp;#x200B;I am currently awaiting a referral back into the mental health services, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2016 following a period of elevated mood (manic). I have had my mood decline the last few months but I am confused over my diagnoses and condition.&amp;#x200B;Some of my symptoms  I experience doesn't seem to match those that others have. I don't really have anyone to talk too about the condition so I could be wrong but I have limited experiences of discussing my issues. I am extremely paranoid I am being watched, I feel like there are cameras over my house and there are people watching me and judging my life. There is a big mirror in the bathroom and I feel like it's a one-way mirror and a camera behind it. I don't want to tell my girlfriend or doctor about it because they might think I am crazy or pretending but I am really worried about it. I don't like showering because I feel like I am being watched and recorded.&amp;#x200B;Is paranoia a symptom of bipolar disorder? sometimes I get really confused. [info] None [info] 1551369654

BipolarTypeOne [info] Ulgra,Whenever you start something new in life, you start from first principles and with beginner lessons and techniques. It doesn't matter if it's a sport, programming language, cooking, whatever. This illness isn't that much different. You start with basic techniques and move up as you learn. Decades of medical experience treating patients with bipolar disorder have taught clinicians to start with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, sedatives upon first diagnosis which they tune over time. This is the medically indicated way to treat this illness. Someone who is just starting treatment or considering it, should start at the beginning by following medical advice and taking their prescribed medications. Suggesting otherwise is unethical as it steers them away from proven treatments and worsens their outcomes.After a few years trying lots of medications and living with the illness you become more knowledgeable about yourself and about which medications have worked and have not (something you cannot at the beginning). At this point, if the medications have worked poorly or are a direct immediate threat to your health, it might make sense to start considering med-free as your other options have been exhausted. This is not a recommendation to make to someone who is just starting out.People who have this illness and are untreated are in a very poor position to learn how to "think critically" about an illness they don't yet understand much about. That is a time where their focus must be on medical advice and stabilization, not on how to avoid taking medications because they read somewhere that yoga and a better diet might do the trick. It is so hard just to get people to seek professional help--telling them they don't have to take medications is fundamentally irresponsible. I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone say "Oh, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I've never taken any medications so I don't think it's that bad." That is what you are enabling.Holding out the idea that there is a point in the future where medications can be discarded is also unethical and against medical advice. There are special cases and considerations, but these are a minority and must be treated that way.This kind of "guidance", take your medications, is as straightforward as "quit smoking because it is bad for your health". It is unambiguous and not debated by any reputable clinicians. Your thoughts and feelings about smoking do not change the fact that it's bad for you. The same goes for the need to take medications. People who are just starting out should focus on the basic rules as promulgated by medical mental health experts, not the rare exceptions. In this case, it's "you must take your medications." When I was diagnosed, I needed my psychiatrist to unwaveringly tell me that I needed to be hospitalized and stabilized on medications after which I would need to keep taking medications. The worst thing he could have done is said "well maybe you'll do ok without meds. why don't you think critically about this and get back to me if you need anything else?". That guidance to take medications remains the same decades later. It is the only responsible advice to give a new patient. Period. There's nothing flaky about guidance. It isn't a shot in the dark. It is the best known course of action as determined by thousands of clinicians analyzing decades worth of data to discover what works and what doesn't. Your car may seem to drive fine on bald tires, but most don't and even yours should be changed according to guidance (laws) provided by your state.People can decide not to take their medications, it's just that in the vast majority of cases, that's a really bad decision. I think we, who have been dealing with this illness all of lives, understand that point and should guide others towards medical guidance not provide them rationalizations for blowing it off.

jaydenh [info] Lithium and mood stabilisation. Hey guys, I have been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and put on lithium, for 2 weeks no, i'm on 500mg and it pretty much has no effect, also on latuda(anti-psychotic, 1 month) 40mg and seroquel IR (3 months) 200mg (sleep).It almost feels like my hypomania can't be stopped with this combo. Wouldn't a significant amount of my dopamine be blocked at this point?How can I be constantly hypomanic for 6 days and be on lithium, my friend tried 250mg and was FLOORED.He said he felt extremely dedated and drunk, clurring his words etc and sleeping for like 12-14 hours, I'm lucky to get 7 hours sleep myself..I understand i'm tolerant to seroquel and probably getting used to latuda but this is ridiculous, I've had serious arguments with friends, coworkers and family due to my expansive mindset and irritability/rages. (usually at retards at work, or stupid people in public, Iwould like to believe its justified, since theyre retards, but even that sounds like a hypomanic thing to say.Anyway, send your experiences to this space, I'm keen to get an idea of how other people experience such combinations, especially the lithium side of things, thanks for taking the time to read this :) [info] None [info] 1555056559

Namaslayy [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 19 (I'm 31 now). The best thing you can do before seeing a therapist is to keep track of your moods. The therapist is going to want to see if you have rapid cycling, to be able to determine the type of meds you may need. However, the only other thing that is going to determine it is your life, lifestyle, and behavior. You won't know until you see a professional. But please do it because you've got to trust your gut too when it comes to your mental health.  [info] None [info] 1516315992

herbistheword [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 at age 22! In my experience, life has been a total 180 since my diagnosis... So many of the things that, up until that moment, felt to me like personal failures and flaws were explained by my disorder. I learned to spot signs of the onset of an episode (for me, I develop bouts of insomnia before any behavior effects kick in. If I can can get myself to sleep during these pre-episodic symptoms, I can abort the swing completely!) and my therapist and medication have helped me develop into a more grounded person that I'm proud to be.Basically- it sounds scary because there's such a stigma associated with it. It implies that your life and emotional state is out of your control... but in reality, a correct diagnosis is the moment you get to reclaim your control.Don't let yourself be defined by a disorder you have. Define yourself by the person you become and the actions you take. If you wanna talk ever, or have any questions, please shoot me a PM. You aren't alone! [info] None [info] 1444937925

Maddz_in_progress [info] To my childhood therapist who invalidated all of my trauma and said I was lying Trigger warning: mentions of sexual assualt, abuse, and suicideI HATE YOU. I started being forced to see you as mandated by the courts after I went to my final facility. I was 16. I was so excited to finally speak to someone and open up. The first day we met you opened my file and judged me based off of everything you read. I remember being so scared to open up but wanting to so badly. I remember starting off with "I think being in facilities most of my teen years has traumatized me to a degree" AND YOU LAUGHED. You laughed in my face and said that wasnt a reason to be traumatized. You immediately shut me up every time i brought it up and i still struggle with validating these feelings. I remember getting flashbacks to sexual abuse as a little girl and crying to you about them hysterically and saying "I am having a hard time believing this given your family history". I remember the day after one of the boys in our facility r\*ped me on a trip you told me I was LYING and being DRAMATIC. Everytime I would bring up trauma from severe bullying you would laugh and say we were all teased, NO YOU IDIOT WE ARENT ALL TOLD TO KILL OURSELVES EVERYDAY AND BEATEN UP WEEKLY. I had to be removed from my middle school twice because the bullying got so bad the superintendent said it wasnt safe for me to keep going. All the times I brought up my parents toxic and abusive behaviors you said I should be more grateful. Yes, I should be more grateful, maybe then CPS wouldnt remove me from my house and force me into various facilities. Finally, the day I told you about the suicide of my best friend you said "you never mentioned him before which leads me to believe you werent that close, maybe its time to move on and see what the real problem at hand is". The day i met with a psychiatrist you were present, I stayed silent as you told him that you believe I am bipolar due to my impulsive behaviors and delusions. I was diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features that day. I didnt even speak. It took me so long to be able to open up again and when I finally did I was diagnosed with CPTSD and told I wasnt bipolar at all. I still struggle immensely with validating my trauma, and have a deep fear that everything I am feeling is truly delusional. I HATE YOU LAURA. [info] None [info] 1587388229
awkwardaster [info] I have Bipolar 1 and also respond well to medication. I haven't gone to therapy much, but lately because of a recent episode I will be attending therapy. I have psychotic manic episodes and rarely get depressed. When I am exposed to extreme stress and have a hard time sleeping, I will have racing thoughts and then get into a manic episode. When I'm having a manic episode I typically get extremely philosophical (I'm normally not) and sometimes paranoid about the government, my family, etc. I will think that other people are living with a blindfold on and I'm the only one who can "see the light". Sometimes I become "promiscuous" or want to buy things I don't need, but I typically do not harm myself or others. If the episode is really bad I will have outbursts and panic attacks as well as paranoia.   I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 17 (I am currently 22), in the spring of my senior year of high school. I have been hospitalized because of it. Fortunately I have an extremely supportive family who always help me recover after an episode. Since my diagnosis I have only had 4 bad episodes. I know that I need to live a life where I have a good self care routine and am exposed to low levels of stress. I can get by on just one mood stabilizer when my stress levels are low, but when they increase I need to take an antipsychotic. I would prefer to not take medication, but it is something I need because of my condition.  [info] None [info] 1381423922

sewkate [info] Potential diagnosis on top of Bipolar 2 I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for over 2 years now and my current therapist (I've seen her for about 2 months now) thinks I am displaying traits of borderline personality disorder. It honestly explains a lot of my symptoms, so she is talking with my psychiatrist and I'll be meeting with him to see what this might entail. I'm really freaked out about this, especially since it came with the very strong suggestion to cut my workload by 25-50% and increase my therapy by at least joining a skills group if not joining an outpatient group. This has been a challenge since I'm in a grad school that doesn't offer much in the way of disability services for mental health.I currently live with my partner and I'm scared as to how this might change things between us, though he has been incredibly supportive. It's just really messing with my sense of self and how I've come to terms with having all these emotions and episodes.Would anyone be able to share their experience with bipolar and borderline personality disorder?

okmikay [info] Dissociation episodes? I've been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years, and I remember the dissociative episodes starting my last year of high school. I would be in class, actively participating, and then suddenly feel like I wasn't there anymore. Like everything that was happening around me was a dream or a mirage. I could speak and see but it all felt fake. It scared the hell out of me. Those went on for a few months and then went away (they would usually last a couple hours at a time, sometimes several times a day). Recently, 3 years later, I'm having these episodes again. It's killing me. I have these incredibly intense dreams/nightmares, and now reality feels like just another dream.I'm bipolar 2, and not prone to ~true~ manic episodes.  I take wellbutrin now, but during high school I was on no medication. I smoked marijuana at the time, and I suspected that was what was causing the dissociation and stopped. But I no longer smoke and here I am.I wanted to find out if these are normal, and if anyone has any tips on how to handle these episodes? Are there medications that treat this. Anything helps.

withdelight [info] I have both. I was diagnosed with bipolar not long before I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. Honestly, my diet needs some work so I really can't be of much help there...but I do take synthroid and cytomel for the thyroid, and wellbutrin, lamictal and cymbalta for the bipolar. I have a psychiatrist who deals with my psych meds and an endocrinologist who deals with the thyroid, but when I get labs for my thyroid they usually send the results to my psychiatrist as well to keep him in the loop. My labs have been consistently in a good range for several years now. As far as fatigue, I do have a lot of fatigue and always have, but since going on medication for my thyroid I've found the fatigue to be more related to my psych medication; for example, I was on seroquel for several years, which made me exhausted! So besides the thyroid, you may also want to do some research on whatever psych meds you're taking, in case that may be part of it.Oh, and I also take a multivitamin, plus fish oil for omega-3s, every day, per my last psychiatrist's recommendation.

AffableJoker [info] It's been so long since I played the med merry-go-round, it's hard to remember what did what.Before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was diagnosed with psychotic disorder NOS. So I basically had a psychotic episode seemingly on its own, but I'm pretty sure I was depressed at the time and was just withholding that information as it was viewed as a sign of weakness in my family (at the time).So my first round of medication was antipsychotics on their own.Zyprexa was first, but it caused a huge amount of weight gain. It did stop the psychosis, but I went from very underweight to overweight very fast. I was also tired all the time, pretty much spent the year sleeping.I stayed on that for a year or so, then ended up back in the hospital multiple times for mood symptoms and got rediagnosed as bipolar and was moved to a different psychiatrist.So then I was put on Depakote, didn't do much. No side effects but didn't really help.Lamictal, didn't helpTegretol, didn't helpSo then we decided to try other kinds of stuffLithium, did help but I was right at the cusp of the toxicity level so we kept trying.Abilify, helped but made me tired all the time.Risperdal, helped but a ton of weight gainSeroquel, helped but made me a little tired. Not as tired as the others though.Geodon, absolutely terrible side effects. I don't even want to think about it.Saphris, terrible.Gabapentin, absolutely nothing, no side effects or anything.Citalopram, made me manicLatuda, made me super tiredWellburtin, made me super manic. Like I thought I could fly and almost jumped off a building manic. [info] None [info] 1487540990
manic_mondayz [info] maintaining complacency when you 'feel normal' So I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for about 9months. I'm currently taking Wellbutrin 300mg Depakote 1000 seroquel 500But ifeel normal now.. I feel like I don't need meds anymore but apart of me knows that I only feel normal because of the meds. Does anyone know how to stay compliant..( also part of me wants to smoke weed again - but like the latter I know it's probably not the best for me)Edit: I would really love to thank each and everyone of you for taking the time to help me or even for just reading my question - you all rock!

babyforks [info] We just seem like good friends now. He asks about my day, how I felt when I was diagnosed with bipolar, how’d the break up go. No one else asked me how my diagnosis has affected me before. I think he may just want to travel because he wants to see more. It’s only been a few days since we’ve reconnected, but they have been nice. I don’t think we could do long distance though. That would be selfish. He also has one semester left of college and I have three. We’re both design majors so it feels so good to have common ground with someone. When we dated in high school we went to different high schools and neither of us drove. We never really had a chance. We were both immature. Now we’ve had our own experiences, and I wish there was a chance. He probably just sees me as a friend rather than an ex. [info] None [info] 1513627815
shitdownhill [info] Just diagnosed with bipolar. Hi guys. Yesterday I was diagnosed with bipolar. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist and nutritionist. I originally was so hopeful for an answer, but immediately after she said it felt so overwhelming and devastating. I just feel empty now and confused. Where do I start? Are there resources about bipolar other than on reddit and webmd? I am worried now because what if the diagnosis is wrong? What if it’s BPD? They are so similar. I am concerned about the effects mood stabilizers could have on my brain anatomy and physiology if this is the wrong diagnosis? How do clinicians differentiate between the two? I have a biology background. And then how the hell do I continue my life living as “my normal.” Where do I go from here? I feel so lost. Edit: spelling [info] None [info] 1523715984
werkk12 [info] I (F/24) might have just ruined everything with the guy (M/28) I'm romantically involved with. So it's a bit complicated but I'll try to explain everything. Originally we met online and instantly hit it off. We live in different countries but we talk pretty much everyday. We were very flirtatious and after 6 months we met in person. A little backstory with me; I'm pretty severely mentally ill and have been battling a lot of issues. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and a few other things. I was also in a very abusive relationship when I was a bit younger and for a while I really feared men and still have a lot of self esteem issues from it. So to get to the root of my problem; we say I love you and are very affectionate with each other but it's understood that we could never really have a relationship. Neither of us like the idea of a long distance relationship and we will probably never live in the same country. A little over a month ago I started to get the feeling that I was in love with him. I brushed it off for a while but then I went to visit him and I realized that I really was in love with him. He's told me in the past that he can't fall in love and he's kind of a cold person which I understand. I never expected him to reciprocate my feels. But being in love with him was eating me up inside and it started to really hurt. My problem is I have one side of me that's very laid back and reasonable and another side that's very dramatic and at times delusional. So I decided that I couldn't be in love with him and that it would be best if we stopped talking for a while so I could work out my feelings. I told him this and after he asked some questions I admitted that I was in love with him. He took it well and was really understanding and supportive and that was that. It's only been a few days but I regret it immensely and I feel like I really fucked up. I'm scared that he isn't going to love me anymore when we start talking again and that things will never be the same between us. So now I'm torn about what to do. I don't know if I should just try to talk to him and apologize or if I should give it time or what. I know this is all my fault but I really want to fix this and I don't know how.tl;dr I told the guy I'm in love with that I needed space and now I regret it. [info] None [info] 1491848575
idonteatbugs04 [info] So many responsibilities can't do it I think I might lose control help I am in school full time and I work also part time and also volunteer and my schedule is stock full of all these things I am supposed to be doing it is Monday I have a full day ahead of me and I am really struggling to be normal because only I understand my potential and everyone else wants to see me as a normal human. The thing is I can't fit into this role because I am not human like them. And people will just tell me I am crazy but only I know the truth and I am alone in that. I am teetering at the edge not sure what to do I  just cannot pretend anymore but I feel uneasy about going off the edge because maybe it will be great and maybe I will fall I don't know why I feel uneasy; I just do, gut instinct.

divineintervention17 [info] Okay.   I don't think that my family was as rich as yours, but we were upper-middle class and my dad (and to a lesser extent my mum) did see people with extreme mental health issues, or homeless people, as inferior or forever damaged or lost causes- this extended to the homeless. I think that you might feel this way at a subconscious level too. My parents had a shift of perspective when I was diagnosed with bipolar after doing a serious of erratic things that eventually landed me in a hospital (due to a drug overdose). I know that schizophrenia is harder to handle, after all one of my best friends from high school unfortunately suffers from it, but I believe they are stigmatised in a similar fashion.   Anyway, I am fairly stable now with a well paying job from my undergrad degree in writing and am also doing a masters of historical research. My parents were (happily) surprised that a person with bipolar could be accomplished in any way. People are not only their illness, they are nuanced and potentially capable and are not just write offs. I hate telling people that I have bipolar because often times they will start subtly studying me like I am an illness and not an individual. Don't make this mistake.  [info] None [info] 1529234034
trashy_cakes [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 before adhd even though I've had the latter for longer. Once my bipolar was under control, I told my psych that I've been having trouble concentrating and staying on task, getting distracted easily etc so she prescribed me Adderall. Basically I double checked the symptoms of adhd before my appointment, mentally checking off which ones I have and went in with the intention to get Adderall. Don't ask for it specifically though, at least not until they tell you what they're giving you then maybe you can request it [info] None [info] 1564486760
weHenley [info] 15. My dad would offer me alcohol when I was depressed (I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years later), and when I refused would not speak to me for days. So eventually I just became his drinking buddy, which lead to alcohol abuse then alcoholism. I wish I'd said a firm no and not let him emotionally blackmail me. Alcohol has screwed up a lot of things in my life and I can't get that time back. [info] None [info] 1546254174
subcuta [info] Regret impulsive legal name change Hi everyone (x-posted with small changes to r/bipolar, but I really look forward to your thoughts here on this sub!)About 4 years ago I legally changed my middle and last names. My reasons weren't entirely meritless but in retrospect I regret everything. I would appreciate any reactions or advice you may have as I prepare to change it again.For context I am 33F, never married. I was undoubtably exhibiting hypomanic behaviors/symptoms at the time (I'm diagnosed with bipolar II disorder) and was also struggling with alcohol, relationships, and finding a job after graduation from a program I frankly should have failed out of. I was awfully proud of myself for the name change at the time (naturally, given my mental state) but now I think it is juvenile and silly: both the names I chose and the act of the changing.(I also struggle with codependence and a dysfunctional childhood, which I believe is the root of my struggles with mental illness. Since working on codependence, I have been more content/stable than ever before.)Anyway, it occurred to me about a year ago that there was nothing stopping me from changing it back or to something else. I considered:* **Keeping my new/made up surname as a middle name** (dropping my new/made up middle name and not re-adding my birth middle name) **and changing my legal surname back to my birth surname*** **Changing my entire name back to my birth name** (dropping made up middle and surnames, adding back birth middle and surnames)* **Letting my mother choose** my new nameI had the idea of letting my mother choose recently while musing with her (we have repaired our relationship) about why it was hard for me to decide what to do about my name. I told her I regretted taking the issue of my name into my own hands and I just wanted nothing more to do with it. Perhaps on a whim, I asked her to choose my new name.She agreed, and I told her she could decide whatever she wanted: my original name or anything else. After a few days, she decided on keeping my birth first and last names and adding a *totally new* middle name,\* which she personally likes, sounds nice, and she believes has meaning for me (Renée, meaning "rebirth").*\*My birth middle name is one of those kind of filler names that is very common in certain ethnic/religious groups and is almost all girls' middle name on my dad's side of the family.... (my parents are no longer married). I never cared much for it, but it's common for people on my dad's side to call me FirstName BirthMiddleName (still).*I think having my mother choose is potentially a brilliant and poetic ending to a weird, uncomfortable story from an equally weird, uncomfortable time in my life. The only thing holding me back is the idea of having *YET ANOTHER (!)* made up name. Like, when does the crazy stop?? I know this feeling is more about fear of what others will think (strangers and also my dad/family) than anything I feel myself. Still, I found this whole ordeal painful and am understandably reluctant to go through it again, therefore I am also leaning toward just changing it back entirely to my birth name. And then I worry that doing that would basically disrespect my mother after I asked her to help me with this. I also like the name she chose a lot.Getting a sense of what others think about this will (I think) help me come to some peace with whatever I decide. Perhaps you (being a name nerd) have some ideas about what kinds of questions I should consider as I make this decision. Or if you think you really do know what is best (maybe you've been through something like this), I am all ears. Thank you for reading.**UPDATE:** Thank you to the user who suggested adding Renée as a second middle name in addition to my birth middle name. I had thought about doing that using my current/new/"made up" last name as a second middle name, but hadn't thought about it in this iteration (for some reason). Renée works well with my birth middle name as they are both French and I can even hyphenate them easily (Marie-Renée). I ran it by my mom and she loves it, too! I am really happy with this name and decision and I really appreciate all your support and enthusiasm. Thanks everyone! [info] None [info] 1534266455
magicelastic [info] Paranoia / hallucinations? Help? I sometimes get very scared that something (a black entity / Satan / a demon) is coming for me and it is so terrifying. I will also hear things (knocking, light walking, small physical noises) and see dark shapes. Usually it ends up in me starting at the door or ceiling with the lights on until I go to sleep, and doesn’t happen unless I am already in a depressive state and / or it’s super late. I’ve had this problems since I was a kid (abused Jehovah’s witness kid scared of Satan), but it was very bad last night. From 1AM to 6AM, I stared at the door in the bedroom and only spoke on whispers because I could feel it coming for me. I was so terrified and my boyfriend was trying to help (saying it’s not there, trying to get me to look away, turning lights on), but I couldn’t move or stop rocking aggressively or do anything but keep watch. I also hyperventilate a few times because my boyfriend tried to get me to look away and I just freaked out. Do any of y’all have experience with this? What the fuck basically?Edit: I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 14 and I’ve been in a depressive state for months atm [info] None [info] 1526687722

Opiates help without a doubt, they clear me of my symptoms like i was taking a anti-seizure medication to control seizures. But its not that, its an opiate, opiates literately get rid of my crazy ass symptoms. By the way i have been in mental health care this whole time. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a very long time ago and i deal with that also. I have reached out to them through all of this craziness. In the end they told me there is nothing they can do for my situation. PEOPLE AMAZE ME. seriously. Opiates get rid of my symptoms, thats it. I never get high off of it. I mean literately, am i supposed to like end my own life at this point? it seems like the rational thing to do, i lost everything at this point, because i got sick? i can't even get people on the Internet to believe my story? my life? again, people amaze me. by the way i am not going to end my life. but seriously i have hit a wall. a long long time a go i hit this wall.

nos4autoo [info] I completely agree with your assessment. Those medications also have a lot of side effects, the biggest ones that affect your daily life being lots of weight gain and fatigue. I've been diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic effects. Finding the best combination of medicine is absolutely key, but it can still take years of recovering and relearning how to live your life. It's taken many years, but I can now live on my own, work a full time job, socialize with friends somewhat regularly. However, I would never say it's a perfectly normal life at all. I'd say it's pretty normal, but there are many things that get in the way or affect your day to day activities and can limit your abilities. [info] None [info] 1512948663

Oakland_Raiders [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and ADHD 8 years ago. I have done ADA paperwork for accommodation in college and I have received treatment consistently since my diagnoses maintaining a record of my disability and my belonging to a protected group.I am a teacher, my principal and vice-principal are egotistical, control freaks who have been trying to make my life hell and push me out since October. The way they have gone about this has left a trail of inconsistency, contract violations, and unjustifiable treatment. Had I submitted ADA paperwork in August, I would have more than sufficient evidence to prove I was harassed. However, up until I turn in my paperwork on Monday, I have been nothing but a white male in their eyes, but that doesn't mean I haven't had protected status the entire time, they just didn't know about it.I want to know if I can claim I was harassed while having protected status, not necessarily because of it.

I can start taking another med for that, but I know that I'm pretty much on my own in it, and I can't really tell everyone because a lot of people already assume I'm a little off, and most people stay far away from the bipolar guy.

dublinhank [info] Mental illness is always a bummer. Just because one is more debilitating than the other, doesn't make your situation any less valid. Depression sucks. Anxiety sucks. The good thing is it seems like you've made a bit of a revelation. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about seven years ago. Like you, I used this as an excuse to justify all of my shitty behavior, even when I knew it wasn't the cause. The most important thing that I realized is people will only be understanding for so long, if it all. If you're an asshole, it doesn't matter that you're a bipolar asshole. The diagnosis is important so that you can learn the things you need to do to live your best life. [info] None [info] 1539824451
colethania [info] Guys there’s anyone here who also has sleep paralysis in a daily basis caused by bipolar? So I always had episodes of sleep paralysis, since I was a kid but there were not so regularly. Since I was diagnosed with bipolar, that was when I had 14 years old I’m now 21 but back then I didn’t know that what I was having was sleep paralysis I thought it was nightmare and hallucinations, so two years ago I discovered by googling that I was experiencing SP, since I’ve struggle a lot with it, earlier this year I decided to see a “sleep doctor” sleep specialist and I did that test that you spend the night in a lab and they watch your sleep. So the result came in and I went to the doctor appointment and she said that everything was normal but the SP happens to me regularly because of my bipolar and there’s basically nothing that can be done about that, she said that the medicine she would prescribe to help with SP would affect my bipolar and it could initiate manic and depressive episodes so I cried and everytime I go to sleep and I have a very aggressive and confusing  experience with SP i get bitter and bitter but also hopeless cause I can’t even take a nap during the day it’s literally a constant fear of falling asleep. But like I’m dealing you know, somethings are not on my control I guess, I can try to be more positive and be more racional during the episode but still I can’t be free from them.

0aabceh [info] Relationships and pursuing relationships leave us vulnerable and sometimes feeling stupid comes with the territory. It happens to most people, it's definitely happened to me. I am sorry your "friend" or her friend "set you up" but it sounds like you made the right move steering clear of them. The "shy" guy sounds like a good one to have dodged as well. Any guy who is going to interrogate you and then ask for a secret relationship is a hard pass and has some weird complex or something. How would you explain that to someone? Well in a way you kind of just explained it to me (us) and it doesn't sound all that bizarre or out of the ordinary. Sometimes it takes a long time for us to meet the people we are supposed to, maybe some of us won't meet them. Maybe there are no people we're "meant" to meet and it's just dumb luck you come across someone you connect with. Maybe we can influence our luck by changing our scenario or actions. It's hard to say, it would be awesome if there was a guide with procedures and we could just follow that and BOOM Boyfriend! or BOOM Girlfriend! I think the best we can try to do is be honest with ourselves (you are) and try to look forward to the next opportunity and be prepared.I can empathize with the idea of feeling undesirable because of mental health issues. My dad killed himself, I am diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, "insanity" is rife in my family. So firstly, how the hell could anyone ever be attracted or find something so damaged appealing or desirable? Two, even if I was in that situation how could I in good conscience have a biological child knowing how fucking insane I have been? Those questions still really bother me now and I don't have answers. Most of my relationships now are brief because if I find someone who seems attracted to me I lose attraction to them because I hate myself, why would they like me?  [info] None [info] 1523335790

ecarg1 [info] Manic Embarassment I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 over the summer after suffering from an extreme manic episode. It’s been months since then but I just can’t get over how embarrassing I was. I had lashed out on my best friends and conspired that they were all out to get me and talking behind my back. I said awful things to my best friend about how she’s not loyal, an asshole, etc. I also became extremely desperate and clingy to this guy I was seeing. It scared him off, and I went on a rant, saying awful things about his character that weren’t true. During my mania, I was in a state of psychosis and was completely disconnected from reality and had no control over what I was saying. I have then made it up to my friends by telling them about my illness, but I still have an overwhelming feeling of guilt. How do you guys deal with your embarrassing manic episodes? I’m pretty new to this and bracing myself for the next episode. [info] None [info] 1580768521
bridgeeeeeeee [info] My drunken behavior is scaring my loved ones Hey guys thanks for reading this is my first post here. I have been drinking daily for the past year and I’m starting to think I have a problem. Every time I drink I blackout every time and the next day my family and friends tell me things I said and did that surprise me. This morning my boyfriend told me that last night I broke several plates and glasses and threatened to kill him if he touched me. He said I was talking about a time I was assaulted when I was 15 and that I said I was going to kill all men and chop their genitalia off. I do not say these things when I’m sober. When I drink I get very angry and I want to pick fights with everyone and hurt people. My dad passed away of complications from alcoholism a few years ago and even though I tried to change him I’m feeling like I am following in his footsteps now. I can never have 3 or 4drinks I have to have 8 or 9. I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back and I think drinking makes it worse. Until today I always thought I was just the funniest friend and that everyone was boring because they didn’t drink as me. But after last night I think I might have a problem. Sometimes I will go to the liquor store 2 or 3 times a day because I always feel like I haven’t had enough. I’m ashamed of the way I’ve acted and the trouble I’ve caused. I don’t know what I am trying to say but I can’t stop how can I get help ??? I don’t want to hurt people anymore [info] None [info] 1584416420

Hydroelectric_dam [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 13. I am now 28 and in remission after years of counseling and treatment. Ultimately, I found the counseling and delving into philosophy and myself far more beneficial for my recovery than the drugs ever were, but I would be dead if I didn't have both. Based on what you just said about dosages, etc., I believe you probably have been diagnosed as well. Believe me when I say I understand wanting to get away from traditional meds. I urge you, however, to really think about the effects you are describing. It does not sound like you are experiencing remission, it sounds like you are hypomanic: you have it all figured out, what you have found "is love for everything and everyone" , "mystical effects" of the treatment you came up with.  I know how incredible it feels, but you are not better, and the crash that is coming is not worth it.   Do this microdosing thing if you want, but please at least be in counseling if you are trying a non-traditional approach. Please don't fight this battle alone, we don't all make it when we do.

AstralMarmot [info] Poor impulse control just screwed up a important relationship at my dream job. Here's how I'm dealing with it. Apologies in advance for the length of this post.I have been a professional organizer since I dropped out of college at 19. I've mostly worked on political campaigns, which I have a strong aptitude for, and also meant I struggled financially when campaign season was off. At 27, I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, in the 98 percentile (I'll never forget the doctor incredulously asking me, "You have a job??"). In 2017, I stopped drinking. Last year at 33, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. All of these things have fundamentally changed my life for the better. As everyone here knows, it is a process. But I've been doing the work, and I'm seeing the results.Last year, I ran a successful city-wide campaign that implements a new environmental fund that predominately, but not exclusively, benefits low-income and minority communities on a huge scale. That success opened many doors to me, and at the beginning of April, I was hired as Executive Director of a vibrant environmental activist non-profit. I finally have stable employment, a position of leadership, and the chance to use skills I've spent so much energy developing. I'm a woman of color in a mostly white city, and the recognition of the need to form coalitions between under-served communities and environmental orgs is a powerful new paradigm reshaping this movement. To be part of that shift, to be asked to bring my vision to bear in service of the climate crisis... it's my dream. I felt like I finally made it. (For the record, you're free to disagree with the politics, but that's not why I'm here).I knew the honeymoon wouldn't last. And today, I ended it in a big way.I was in a staff meeting, co-leading with the interim ED. We have very different styles of operating. She is meticulous, organized, extremely linear, and a morning person. I am... none of those things. I've learned how to cope for those deficiencies, but that difference has made my onboarding process difficult. In the meeting, she said something about how much I had to learn. I'm sure it wasn't personal. But I reacted. I Google chatted one of the staff members (a good friend of mine) that I was starting to get a little tired of being babied by the interim ED.That person was projecting the agenda. Everyone saw it. Everyone.I hurt someone I value, someone under a tremendous amount of stress, who has been working really hard to be an advocate and a resource for me. I embarrassed myself and her in front of the entire staff. I was rude, thoughtless, and disrespectful. And I belied something I believe about myself, that I am direct and deal with problems head on.I haven't felt shame like this in a long time.I have been very up front about my ADHD at work. The people I oversee are people I know and trust, and I want them to know where I'm strong and where I'm weak. Mostly that manifests as forgetfulness, leaving my shit everywhere, not tracking pieces of paper, and needing to move around constantly. Poor impulse control is something I've worked so hard on that... well, I forgot about it. I let my professionalism lapse and just blurted out a passing emotion in a way that caused real damage. It felt like I just stepped all the way back to square one.That's the context. What I really want to do, aside from getting this off my chest, is explain how I dealt with and am dealing with it.1. **I owned it.** Immediately after the meeting ended, I had a conversation with the Interim ED and said how sorry I was.2. **I shut up and listened.** I held space while she explained her hurt, and the frustrations she has with training me and the organization as a whole. Most of it is organizational, really. But my actions reinforced that feeling. And for a neurotypical, I must be insanely hard to work with.3. **I didn't make excuses.** Nothing can excuse shitty behavior like that, especially in a professional environment. My mental afflictions are mine to manage and no one else should be asked to do so.4. **We addressed the heart of the issue.** We went through the roots of our frustrations and sorted them out together. Frankly, I'm lucky she is level-headed and kind enough to have done so with me. If she had just walked off, I would have understood, but it would have made a bad situation even harder to fix.5. **We made a plan**. A plan to address the frustrations, and to continue the conversation. That space was mostly for expressing feelings, but we ended with concrete action that will help us both move forward.6. **I went home and cried my brains out.** I needed to get the feelings out. I needed to experience the shame, because it was there. 7. **I made myself let go of the shame.** Feelings are kind of like house guests; you honor them when they show up, treat them with respect, and also make sure they don't take up residence on your couch forever. Shame in particular is a hard one for me. My parents didn't believe in mental illness, and my struggles were attributed to a failure of will. I believed for so long that I was a shitty person, wasting my gifts because I wouldn't apply them. Now I know I couldn't apply them without help. I sought that help, and began the long process of dismantling the self-loathing I'd accrued over a lifetime. As Uncle Iroh said, "Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. The true opposite of shame is humility."8. **I went back to work.** I had committed to facilitating a difficult conversation. It was a success, and I think that's due in part to the humility I brought with me - and of course to the amazing people willing to sit down and give their thoughts in a constructive context. I also made a point to honor the Interim ED's hard work. She has earned that and more.9. **I told people I trust about it.** That's all of you. This sub has inspired me so much. This is my first post here, but it feels like the right time. I have so much gratitude for all the wisdom you've given me, and for knowing I have a safe space to admit my failings.And now I'm going to play Stardew Valley, sleep, and start the day tomorrow on the road to being a better human.If you read all of this, thank you. I hope any of it helps you as much as you all have helped me.TL;DR: Hurt someone's feelings at work. I addressed it, owned it, processed it, and now I feel like I can move on.Edit: I clearly have no idea how to format. [info] None [info] 1557459990

jimzsche [info] How do you endure pregnancy without mood regulating medication? I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I do not plan to become pregnant anytime soon. But when that day comes, I’m worried I won’t be able to go through a full pregnancy since I was an absolute mess before going on lithium and lamictal. With raging pregnancy hormones and the absence of mood regulators, I’m almost certain I’d have a manic episode or just become completely psychotic, which I’m sure would be harmful to the baby... and also every other facet of my life. I’d rather not spend 9 months in a straight jacket.  So to women with bipolar disorder who have successfully navigated a pregnancy, how did it go? How did you do it? Are you OK? Would you do it again? [info] None [info] 1537408095
11LeRichard11 [info] Do you think it's type 1 or 2? I'm trying to figure out if I have bipolar type 1 or 2. I know no one here can diagnose me, but still I value your opinion and feel like I would benefit from any closure I can get. I am a 26 year old male. I had my first affective episode (severe; depressive) when I was 12. It wasn't until I was 19, a freshman in college, that I had my first (hypo)manic episode. I started to get depressed/feel strange by the end of my first semester due in part to drug use. So I went to the doctor and was put on anti depressants. When I went back to school after winter break, I went through a traumatic experience during fraternity rush week. I suspect it was both the antidepressants and the rush-week trauma which triggered the (hypo)manic episode that would quickly ensue. During the episode, I totally lost control of myself. I was partying all the time and was really behind on all my work. I still felt like shit a lot of the time but was having a great time "living it up". I was set to fail all of my classes though: I was missing classes left and right, never doing homework, and failing all my exams. I wanted to catch up on my work, but I was so impulsive that as soon as someone asked me to drink with them, I would agree. This happened often because I quickly garnered a reputation for always being down to party. I ultimately had to take a leave of absence because the only other option was straight F's. I went home and I was advised to join an inpatient program (i think mostly for alcohol abuse, but I'm sure I would probably have been placed on a dual diagnosis unit to include bipolar disorder.)To me, this sounds a lot like what doctors call a manic episode with mixed features, a diagnosis which would make me have bipolar type 1. At the time, my doctors had a hard time figuring out if I had type 1 or type 2 because I wasn't taking my medication regularly and because I was abusing substances so frequently. So, I was diagnosed with bipolar not-otherwise-specified (NOS). Eventually, once I started to seem alright, my doctors defaulted to type 2... because I seemed alright. From the beginning, I've stayed well-read on this affliction, but only recently have I looked more into the specifics of diagnosis. From what I've read recently, psychologists and psychiatrists determine if an episode is manic or hypomanic by addressing the patient's functionality during the episode. If that is the standard method of differentiation, I feel *very* insulted that any doctor would look at my case and think to label the episode I'm talking about as hypomanic. Feeling so insulted, I got in contact with the therapist I had had during the episode (and who I continued to see for the rest of my time in college). He is the gold standard of clinical psychologists, so I really wanted to hear what he had to say about it all. He said that diagnosis had always been difficult with me. He said that in particular the substance abuse complicated matters. But he said he thinks it's a good thing that I'm thinking about my diagnosis. By this,I think he means it's good that I'm thinking about it because it's relevant to my life and it shows maturity and self-respect.  This made me feel a little better because he basically re-diagnosed me with bipolar NOS, even if only implicitly. But it still annoys me because in order for the episode I'm talking about to be a hypomanic one, that would essentially mean that I wasn't meeting my responsibilities, perhaps because I was abusing substances, but either way, that I still had the means and ability to function... That's not true though! I couldn't meet my responsibilities because I was so impulsive that I was partying all the time AND because I was so impulsive that I couldn't focus on my homework ever... not even for a few minutes. I realize my being on antidepressants at the time complicates matters, and I don't remember exactly when I was taken off them. But I've tried to put the pieces back together in my memory, and I think my full-blown manic symptoms must have lasted weeks after I was taken off the antidepressants, and the DSM makes a point of saying that episodes with such features should still be labeled as manic and the patient still diagnosed as type 1. People probably make posts like this one all the time, so sorry if you're sick of them. I really want to hear what you think though. Please let me know. Feel free to ask me questions too. I will edit this post with more details of necessary. EDITFor the record, I have had another "up" episode that I can confidently say was hypomanic. I actually started losing weight because of it. Still, it was not nearly as bad as the one I have described above. [info] None [info] 1519513495
moodlemon [info] I’m not sure if this is the right diagnosis As a teenager I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and put in on combination of Wellbutrin and Topamax which worked well for me. I stopped taking those meds after moving away from my hometown, and 5 years later I had what I consider meltdown. I had graduated college, changed careers completely, moved 3 times, and moved in with my long term partner all within a year. Over the years there had been a lot of good and bad times but I don’t do well with a lot of change and I think it was too much too fast. I stopped going to work, started drinking every night, I was constantly starting new projects, diets, looking for new careers, buying clothes, looking for a new apartment, and I was lying to my partner about all of these things. Eventually this all lead to me breaking the lease on our apartment, breaking up with my partner, and starting to pack up my shit because I was moving across the country to start a new life. Barely a day went by when I realized how much I had fucked up. After fixing my relationship, lease problems, and coming clean about my mental health struggles I found a new psychiatrist. She believes that I have Cyclothymia. She explained that because my moods cycle between high and low on a more regular basis and are not as severe that she in opinion bipolar 2 was the wrong diagnosis. She called the meltdown that I went through hypomanic symptoms that were probably brought on by stress. I’ve been back on meds for over a year and definitely feel better. I’m curious if anyone else has been through anything similar and what advice you might have? [info] None [info] 1575752317
BayazRules [info] Meth puts me in my own head, kinda relaxes me. I hole up in my room and fap or listen to music.I did kinda edge into stimulant psychosis last night, though. I'd been up for three days and smoked probably 2 grams in that time frame. I started hearing voices and remembered that I'm a powerful chaos magician who can bend reality, and the voices wanted me dead. I thought I was being remote viewed and my devices had been hacked. Long story short, I went to bed and problem solved. Not once during that ordeal did I consider leaving my room, let alone any kind of human interaction. Believe it or not the scariest psychoses I've had were induced by heavy cannabis use. Twice in the past ten years, smoking weed has driven me out of my fucking mind and landed me in the psych unit. The second time, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I'm not claiming "meth &gt; weed", this has just been my experience and I'm an outlier. [info] None [info] 1552353621
UNPER50N [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and my mood swings varied. Mostly I had long depressive episodes interrupted short and sudden manic episodes. SSRI made me more manic with psychotic episodes. I've been on an SSRI + mood stabilizer for over a decade.  I also have hormonal problems and birth control (usually used to treat hormonal problems) interferes with my meds so I don't take it.   [info] None [info] 1493943435
egglentine [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 I had the hardest time remembering to take my birth control. I was put on psych meds after a complete breakdown that landed me in a hospital. It magically became easier to remember to take my meds after that. I had such a strong desire to feel better. Sounds like you also have that desire!Now I take my meds right when I wake up. I keep them next to my bed with a glass of water. I also have a pouch with "e-z dose" bags so I can carry my meds with me at all times. I sing a little song to myself as I'm walking out the door. "Phone Keys Wallet Meds!" Carrying the pouch around means I can take my meds as soon as I remember instead of waiting until I'm home again. It's also more discrete than any other method I've tried.The meds won't make your symptoms disappear completely. They WILL take the edge off. They reduce severity and frequency of my episodes and that alone gives me enough clarity to keep my meds (and myself) in check. It took me a long time to find the right doses of the right meds but I'm so glad I stuck with it. I feel more stable now than ever before.  This may be an extreme statement but I truly believe that my meds saved my life.  [info] None [info] 1476673440
pepsi109 [info] Worried about symptoms that meds fixed coming back I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a three-month episode of bipolar-like symptoms along with psychotic features. I've been on medication since it happened two years ago. One of the nurses at my mental health clinic told me yesterday that bipolar disorder cycles, saying people might not experience cycles again for years. I knew that people went through shorter cycles but not years.Honestly, I don't even think I am bipolar because I never had symptoms up until my episode and I haven't had any since I started my meds. I was struggling with a large amount of stress in a matter of a month or so and I think that's what triggered a breakdown in my brain. But now that this nurse said it might come back, I'm worried. Has anyone ever had symptoms come back even though they were on medication? Is there such thing as a "bipolar episode" without having bipolar disorder? [info] None [info] 1441240950

GunshyJedi [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 1 1/2 years ago. One thing I've realized is that it's easier to be *sick* than *sinful*. I'm constantly tempted to hide behind my illness and I see others do it all the time. He can be bipolar and function like anyone else if he applies himself and seeks honest help and keeps the pills down. Don't give up on your love without a fight. This may sound crazy, but the best treatment I've ever had is my little brother, my mom, and my sisters getting in my face with genuine love and breaking me out of my own jail. *Edited out my original first paragraph, I over-reacted.

Pozyn [info] My Psychotic Parents So back story. In 2013 (age 16)I was diagnosed with bipolar and sent to a mental hospital. 2015 (age 18) sent again to the same hospital. The second visit was a lot more beneficial I think because I matured a little bit, and was able to accept help.One of my biggest problems in life is my parents, my dad's an alcoholic so he doesn't feature, but my mom and step dad raised me. My mom is a manipulative, psychotic, bitch. I found this out while I was in my "place of healing" where she would message, and phone my friends and girlfriend's parents to tell them how shit they are, and how shit I am.Anyway, in therapy we got a lot sorted out, we were supposed to be a "fixed" family. I just started varsity and all was going great, until my mom set me back by ignoring me for 3 days. Another huge fight one week out of hospital. I went to a friend's house for the night because of the urges I felt to kill myself again. I went home the next day, and my mom acted like nothing happened, after getting scolded by my step dad. That was Wednesday/Thursday. Now it's Monday, yesterday I was supposed to have a family reunion sort of thing at the mall, with family I've never met before. My girlfriend and I go with my parents and sit at the table to wait for the extended family to come. After not even 5 minutes of being together, my mom makes one of her famous snarky comments, that got my blood boiling because she was being horrible to me and my girlfriend because that's the way she feels like acting. And as I learned in therapy, I shouldn't accept being treated like shit.So here I am. Relying on other people and crashing at their place like a hobo, and scrounging around for clothes for the day. The worst part is that I have to go home again eventually. And deal with them.. [info] None [info] 1424671695
soundoftheunheard [info] Mourning: I lost my Nan Although this isn't directly bipolar related, I'm putting this here because this community has been an amazing support for me in the past and I don't really have anywhere else to turn. *What Happened*My Nanny (grandma) died two weeks ago tomorrow. It's frustrating to say, "She was my grandma." because she was so, so much more. She helped raise me. My mom and I lived with her and my grandpa until I was 6 years old. Every year until I went to college I spent a total of a couple of months with them each year. After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I moved in with them again and they supported me—paying for my medical care, getting me through college, being whatever I needed—from when I was 21 to 28. That's now. I also lived with them during my sophomore year at college and summers.  To say, "...my grandma died..." doesn't encompass the loss I feel.She was 66 when she went to the emergency room, and died, only 67 years old. I thought she would live a long time. All of her siblings, many more than a decade older, are still kicking. I had recently made plans to stay in the same metro-area so that I could take care of her in old age. I knew I would take her in and take her on travels once my grandpa passed. He's older and in worse health. There was so much I wanted to share with her. Her death was both expected and unexpected. 52 days earlier, she went to the emergency room with another bad headache and nausea. Later that night, the doctors said they weren't sure if she would make it to morning. I didn't go to the ER with her that day, because it was a headache. We all felt she had been depressed and the issues stemmed from that. Frankly, even the doctors can't say for certain what happened that day and the following weeks, so explaining all of the medical issues would be an exercise in futility. But, it can be summed up in saying she had severe brain damage. During the 52 days, we would go four steps forward, six back, two forward, then one back. By the end, the backwards steps were dominating. Eventually it was clear she would never be off the ventilator and her quality of life would never be sufficient. She wasn't in a coma. We were able to spend time talking with her (lip reading), reminiscing, and eventually saying goodbye. October 6, 2018 was the hardest day of my life. It was time to disconnect the ventilator and let my Nanny pass. We were able to say goodbye and I love you to each other one last time. Her weeping while I was telling her how much I loved and how much she's meant to me will be forever branded in my brain. I also needed her to know that I had done everything I could. I'd made sure she had the best doctors. I'd read all of the research on the theories of what was happening. She told me that "I know you did."*Failure*While I know it wasn't my fault, and I don't feel guilty; I feel devastated that I failed. I couldn't save her. That may seem silly. If the best of the best doctors were at a loss, how could I have done anything more? I'm one of those mentally crazy guys that also happens to be blessed with a bit of brilliance. In my embarrassing hubris, I often feel responsible for fixing the problems that others can't. When family or friends are struggling with problems, I can often step-in and offer a solution. I feel ashamed even writing that, because the amount of ego belief in myself required to think I'm the last great hope is astonishing. But that's been my life experiences and I need to share that to explain why I feel like a failure. If I couldn't save her (by finding a medical professional that had better than a best guess of what was going on), then she wasn't going to be saved. I feel stupid for spending time listening to so many lectures on ancient societies the past six months. What if I had focused on neuroscience? What if I had went ahead and gone to medical school? All of my studies, all of my reading, all of my nerdy lecture-listening habits—all of it—didn't matter. I couldn't save one of the most important people in my life.I want to say again, I don't feel guilty. I feel like a failure. I feel like all of the work and research I've done doesn't matter. It feels so small and is meaningless. I've spent the past couple of years working on research around early voting schedules. It has been meaningful and impactful, but feels like such a waste.*My Relationship Status Quos*So why am I here instead of talking all of this out with my friends and family? My best (only) friend and I had a falling out. I'm still not sure what happened. We decided to live together this past spring. I didn't even know we weren't getting along. I was having some issues and needing medication adjustments, but she said she understood, until suddenly she didn't. I send her an email (she was at work and that was the way we communicated during the day) to apologize for taking so long getting some things out of the garage, but I was on it. I had actually moved most of it before I sent the email. She responded that she doubted I would ever get it done and that it'd be "best for you to find new living arrangements." It was the first she had even brought up that she was irritated by my books in the garage. They were where my car was supposed to go, so it wasn't like they were in the way. I had just parked in the driveway. They had been there three weeks. One of those I was on vacation, the other two, my grandma had started to have headaches, so I was trying to help her and my grandpa out. I was dumbstruck because this was the first time she expressed frustration with anything about our living situation. I admit I can be very ADHD (because I had ADHD), but she was aware and knew these tendencies. Many times I had confided in her my fear of abandonment because of my biological dad's actions and expressed the need to be told explicitly if anything was wrong because I'm awful when it comes to reading people. I responded to her email saying I was kind of shocked. She basically said everybody has things in life they have to deal with and I don't even have much to deal with. I had tried to explain that I knew I had been off, and was working with my doctor to get back on track. She suddenly became very dismissive of my issues with bipolar disorder, which has been a true and difficult struggle. Instead of going into every detail, in summary, she said I needed to suck it up, I had two weeks to move out, and she would prorate August's rent. I don't know the real reason why we had a falling out. In hindsight, it was clear that she was planning this for at least a month before. For example, among other things, anything I had the account for, she had moved to her email. I included this to say, I don't have friends now. Who I thought was my biggest support decided she didn't want me in her life anymore. A week later my grandma ended up in the hospital. She never reached out, despite me contacting her. A week ago she unfriended me on Facebook. Those abandonment issues? Yeah, they've gotten worse. I honestly have no idea what I did wrong.What about my family as support? My family is amazing and great. I have a great mom and dad (step, but that doesn't matter) and three younger siblings I'm close to. The thing is, my grandparents were/are like an additional set of parents to me. More than losing a grandmother, I feel that I've lost a mom. But I don't want to hurt my mom by her taking that the wrong way. For my siblings, they weren't raised by her. They loved her dearly and she loved them. I don't want to talk about my special relationship with her and how much it's hurting. So, I'm here. *Today*Today I've been crying at the smallest thing. The song I want to dance to at my wedding came on. I weeped in the Home Depot parking lot, knowing she won't be there. I saw a sewing machine on Craigslist. For years now we've been trying to find a decent budget one for us that actually works. Again, I cried. Almost every night I have nightmares. She's in life threatening situations. I'm never able to save her. She always ends up dying. Over and over. And over. Sleep is hell. Being awake is hell. I hurt so much. My chest literally aches. Whenever I read old Bible stories or other ancient text and read about the mourners ripping their clothes and pulling their hair out, I never understood. It seemed hyperbolic. It doesn't anymore. I know what it means to feel such loss that you tear at your clothes and hair. My other grandma died a decade ago at the way-too-young 56 years old. That hurt. It hurt a lot. But it hurt like you'd expect. It was awful and sudden and I mourned. But Nanny's death was horrific. It was emotionally traumatizing and exhausting. When she first went into the hospital, my body went into crisis mode. I'm great in a crisis. It's like a calm hypomania that lets me handle whatever serious and timely challenge I face. But now that time is over. There's no more research to do. No more hospital visits. The battle is over and the war is lost. Now there is only pain.I'm not sure how to live life feeling like this. There's no fix or way out; there is only through, but that path out of the darkness feels infinite.TL;DR: I lost one of the two most important people in my life. I'm in immense pain. I don't know where to turn or what to do. [info]  [info] 1539992270
sigmatt13 [info] Needing to vent Life kicks my ass sometimes and I don’t know what to do. My girlfriend and I split due to the distance and although there aren’t hard feelings between. It’s been so difficult because she still wanted to stay together, but the distance was making me feel unable to stay present and happy. I’m about to go abroad for school in Magdalen oxford. My dad went there and has been talking about it his whole life and I feel pressure to enjoy it. I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 and take so many meds that I don’t need to take breakfast:Lamictal- 100mgProzac- 20Buspar- 15Hydroxyzine pam- 25 mg 3x a dayAllergy medsI was just recently increased to the 100 mg of Lamictal from 50mg and put on buspar at the same time, and my head hurts, I feel hopeless, and I don’t even have the energy to get out of bed. The two times I left my bed today I started feeling an overwhelming sense of emotion and ended up in tears going back to lay down. My lamictal gives me nightmares every single time i go to sleep, and then during my depressive episodes, being awake is a nightmare too. I can’t escape my own mind, and think to myself, “what’s the point of letting this pass since it’ll just come back”. At one point in my depressive episodes, I came to the conclusion that I would end up taking my life at some point (not now, not 5 years from now, but probably before old age), but I really want to live. I love so deeply and want nothing but love, but feel so unlovable. It feels good to have a diagnosis, but I still don’t think I’ve figured out my medicine entirely.Depressive episodes are living hell. [info] None [info] 1537743219
applesunderatree [info] Help! Don't know where to post this Hi guys!I honestly don't know where to post this, and I don't know what to do.Two years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and things kinda started being ok once I knew what was happening. My family was awesome in the process, and are still awesome.&amp;#x200B;Recently I got a new psychiatrist that started giving me tasks to do. One of these was talk to someone on the phone for five minutes. I started crying, because of the people listening to my conversation over the phone. Problem? Apparently that's not a thing. Then we started talking about mind reading, and other things that have generally been 100% true for me - but I guess aren't. My psychiatrist wants to do some research and maybe change my diagnosis to schizoaffective disorder - and I kind of feel like my world view has drastically changed.&amp;#x200B;My family feel iffy about the diagnose too, which I kinda get, cause it sounds serious.&amp;#x200B;I don't know if any of this makes sense, but I have no idea how I'm going to cope with another change of diagnosis. I know I need it to get the right treatment, but I'm so scared. And so is my family.

chinacatsunflowaaa [info] Bipolar causing my mental health to deteriorate Hey all, I'm not too familiar with Reddit but I am so desperate for advice or just some words of comfort. I'm 25F and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17. I thought it was "in remission" so to speak for the last year or so but the last few months have been completely agonizing. My moods are so unstable regardless that I am diligent with my medication (tegretol). It's to the point where I don't know what my mood will be like when I wake up and am terrified to interact with anyone- including my boyfriend who I now live with. My mania is more of "psychosis" rather than the textbook definition of elevated mood, etc. Yesterday I felt symptoms of a manic episode so I called my doctor to get an emergency appt, I get in and am totally honest about what's going on and she prescribed me Risperdal. I thought I was getting calmer but by the time I got home the switch in my brain flipped and I went ape shit. Trashed my apartment and was hitting, scratching, biting, etc my boyfriend who was only trying to calm me down (due to me caving and trying to get a psychiatric evaluation at a short term inpatient center near me, but they claimed i didn't seem in crisis. "Wtf do I have to do then OD on something?" was my thinking). My mom ended up driving over to get me and I felt like a toddler because I was just kicking and screaming, slamming my head I felt totally and utterly out of control. This is something that is starting to become more and more frequent and I am fucking terrified of this illness and most of all, myself.I just need to know I'm not alone. I've been to more inpatient and outpatient programs than I can even count. I go to therapy, I'm strict as hell with my meds, what the fuck is wrong with me that those 2 things alone don't work? I'm not suicidal necessarily but bipolar is ruining my life and becoming so unmanageable that I know I'd at least get relief if I was dead. Please someone anyone just tell me there is a fucking light at the end. [info] None [info] 1502537154
ocp_owns_the_cops [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and psychedelics have been a godsend for me.  I think it's all individual.  I have known schitzophrenics who have to avoid cannabis for example at all cost and others who need it.  One of the issues of our draconian laws is these absurd generalizations that do not respect the autonomy of patients.  I am not saying this to criticize you but to point out that mental patients should have respected autonomy as well in my opinion. [info] None [info] 1493952158
FormerlyFishy [info] Sure. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I with psychotic features. That in itself doesn't keep me from driving. I'm unable to work, and can't pay to have my car fixed so I'm grounded in the meantime.  Thank you for the reading suggestion. I'll do that for sure. I'll call my old parish too. Maybe they could send someone on Sundays to bring the Eucharist. [info] Episcopalian (Anglican) [info] 1525992609
pistachioxo [info] I was recently diagnosed with ADHD - I'm 22. Apparently it's easier to miss in girls because symptoms tend to present differently, and because I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago any attention or hyperactivity issues were kind of written off as hypomania. Nobody told me bipolar and ADHD have a really high co-morbidity rate. Additionally, ADHD is harder to diagnose when you're over the age of 18. So I kind of had a triple whammy lmao.In the end I sprung for the full panel of testing through my therapist's colleague who specializes in adult attention deficits. In total it cost me $900, and that was on the low end (in my area anyway) because I gave my therapist permission to collaborate with her, so she was able to help her complete the report faster. Luckily I screened positive for ADHD so it wasn't all for nothing, and my psychiatrist was able to prescribe me dexedrine.I'm not trying to discourage you at all though! It's done wonders for my attention span and combined with my other medications has honestly made me feel better than I have in years. I'm in university and literally went from dropping out of a semester and failing the semester I got back, to getting straight A's in my spring/summer courses because I could finally concentrate. If you can afford to get screened by a professional, I 100% recommend it. Just know that it's often costly - happily for me, the benefits outweighed that. [info] None [info] 1530945428
midnight_sparrow [info] Please go back to your doctor. Having a child really does things to your brain and body chemically.I say this with experience as I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of ignoring signs and symptoms. It has saved my life. Literally. My relationship was tanking after almost daily fights. I attempted suicide twice. I'm lucky not only to be alive, but that my boyfriend was a good enough man to stick by me, and who supported me in getting help for me and for our relationship in couples counseling (which I also recommend).Trust me, getting outside help is going to significantly benefit you and your family. Call your doctor and schedule an appointment, and seek a marriage counselor. You'll see major differences in your situation. [info] None [info] 1537405085
chhharl [info] Starting Lithium-side effects? Ey! Some quick bgAt 14 I was diagnosed with bipolar but never found meds that worked and stopped then at 17Was hospitalized a few years back and they told me I DONT have bipolar, that I have BPD (which I definitely do). Still couldn't find/stick with treatment.Now at 27 after another hospitalization, my new doctor is telling me I have both, which has been my suspicion since the beginning.She's put me on Lithium, I've been taking it for 4 days 300mg extended release at night. Starting in a day I'm gonna be taking 600mg at night.I'm really bad at keeping hydrated, but I'm cutting out soda while I get my meds figured out. I know lithium can make you nauseous but when does it go away? I started taking it Friday and Sunday I was foggy and nauseous and tired all day. Today I was fine but now (4:40am Tuesday) I'm starting to feel the same way. Will it get worse when I ramp up the dose on Wednesday?Also, how am I supposed to feel after it starts working? I've been on a lot of meds before but I don't keep taking them bc I don't see a difference. I'm a very paranoid person but I'm pretty even. I haven't been depressed in awhile? Idk I just don't know how I'm gonna be able to tell if it's working!!Sorry for the long post!!! [info] None [info] 1572950518
Ebonleaf [info] It happens to me quite often. One day the future seems so promising and happy, then the next I am imagining myself being killed, things will seem hopeless, or I just start to worry about everything. It even happens physically too. Like one day I'll look at myself in the mirror and look somewhat pretty, then the next I'll look at myself in the same mirror with the same lighting and look disgusting. It's just how it is for me. To note, I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.I combat it by reading a lot. I am an avid reader to the point where books are literally an addiction for me.

FusRoDontdothat [info] I've never been on adderal, I do have some kind of add, but not diagnosed. My family just thought I was a forgetful child. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder though.Well anyways, back when I was struggling with BPD, what money I didn't spend on rent went to beer and weed. I was always with a bad crowd. One day, were all hanging out at my place, and this guy whips out a big bag of meth. we're all partying, and I just want to get fucked up, so when he offered me some, I said sure.Now the point here is, I was expecting a high, I was expecting a burst of energy, I was expecting to get fucked up. Everyone else was tweaking, but not me, the effects I got from it are the same that I've heard of adderall.My brain slowed down which is rare for me, I had perfect concentration, I didn't even feel like partying anymore. I saw my keyboard(piano) across the room, plugged it in, threw my headphones on and went at it. That was around 11pm. The next time I looked at the clock, it was 7:30am and everyone had left. I was just in the zone playing piano, so concentrated on it that nothing else existed.Basically what I'm saying is, when you have add or ADHD and do amphetamines, you're going to get the same kind of effects whether its meth or adderall(which contains amphetamines). So essentially, they are the same thing. They may be two different substances, but they both affect the body in a similar fashion. Adderall is made to help people with add or ADHD concentrate, but if you do meth with add, you're going to get that same concentration adderall would give you.Now, I don't condone drug abuse(unless its pot), but have you ever done meth or adderall?

anonfapstronaut8 [info] I am diagnosed with bipolar.Never in my life have I been violent or had violent tendencies and never once have I planned to hurt anyone, not even myself. The only times I've used physical force have been in self defense.According to most people who support the idea that we need to take guns away from the 'mentally ill', I should not be allowed to own a gun.Fuck that.I also think it's important to keep a sense of perspective. The amount of people killed by gun violence is dwarfed in comparison by the amount of people killed by vehicles, smoking, obesity, etc. Don't get me wrong, all lives lost are a tragedy and all of these mass shootings are horrendous, but we need to ask if we are willing to trade our individual liberty for any amount of security. And in this case, I'd say the evidence is shoddy that stricter gun laws lead to a reduction in violent crime anyways.Bad people are bad, regardless of their so-called 'mental health'. I've seen the most straight-laced, by the book people do the most horrendous things, and then there are people like [this](https://youtu.be/Y1aOnK-vSvs) , who if we were to meet on the street, would immediately be labeled mentally ill, who wouldn't hurt a fly.Also, I think it's a dangerous path to go down allowing ANY government to decide who is considered mentally capable of owning a gun or keeping any other rights they may have.The potential for abuse of that power is uncomfortable, to say the least.

evil-rick [info] I was taking it when I was about 16 and had the opposite reaction. Prozac made me severely depressed but a lot better at hiding it. Finally I got angry that I was depressed one night and took the whole bottle, then I started taking every pill in the cabinet. Just a few weeks ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder which explains why regular anti-depressants have an adverse reaction with me. But it also tells me that these facilities are playing a dangerous game with kids that they probably can’t even speak to. Forcing a child to take any sort of medication without knowing their current mental or physical health is pure American cruelty. [info] None [info] 1533053556
AndySipherBull [info] And really, the reason why they imprisoned him is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, that he wasn’t just one of a monolithic voice, but he could wrap people around. So there’s theories that there’s infinite amounts of universe and there’s alternate universe. So it’s very important for me to get Hoover out, because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I’m moving back to Chicago and it’s not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer and having a monolithic voice that’s forced to be a specific party. You know, people expect that if you’re black you have to be Democrat. I have a — I've had conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat. They say — you know, first of all, it’s a limited amount of jobs. So the fathers lose the jobs, and they say, “We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.” And then, we got rid of the mental health institutes in the ‘80s and the ‘90s, and the prison rates just shot up.	 	And now you have “Chiraq,” what people call “Chiraq” — which is actually — our murder rate is going down by 20 percent every year. I just talked to the superintendent; met with Michael Sacks; that’s Rahm's right-hand man. So I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know, they tried to scare me to not wear this hat — my own friends. But this hat, it gives me — it gives me power, in a way. You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And also, I’m married to a family that — (laughs) — you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though. But there’s times where, you know, there’s something about — you know, I love Hillary. I love everyone, right? But the campaign “I’m with her” just didn’t make me feel, as a guy, that didn’t get to see my dad all the time — like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman. That was my — that’s my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cape. For me, also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys — non-political, no bullshit — put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay — and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. Because at Adidas, when I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now we have a $38 billion market cap. It’s called the “Yeezy effect.” And I went to Casper. We had a meeting in Chicago. And I said, “You have to bring manufacturing onshore.” And not even shore; into the core. It’s not about the border; it’s the core of Adidas. And Chicago is the core of Middle America. And we have to make Middle America strong. So I had the balls — because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal than to have no fathers in Chicago with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, for no — because it’s habilitation, not rehabilitation, because they didn’t have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone that taught us. They didn’t teach us. Exactly — we had no one that “taught” us. Right? So it’s more important than any specific deal — anything — that we bring jobs into America, and that we provide a transition with mental health and the Amer-I-Can education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he’s worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWork has a beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation. There’s a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called the 13th Amendment. I did say “abolish” with the hat on. Because why would you keep something around that’s a trap door? If you’re building a floor — the Constitution is the base of our industry, right? Of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you — accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber? You end up — you got to remove all that trap door out of the relationship. The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment — and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13 floors, do we? You know, so the four — the four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read — or African Americans to read. And so that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you would get locked up and turned into a slave. Again — so what I think is, we don’t need sentences; we need pardons. We need to talk to people. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. And he looked at my brain — it’s equal on three parts. I’m going to go ahead drop some bombs for you — 98 percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings, but it was counting eight numbers backwards, (inaudible), so I’m going to work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent — Tesla, Freud. So he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar; I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got, and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money. So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories. We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota. edit: I notice now that the transcript has periods and commas which is weird because Kanye doesn't use them.

I made the mistake of checking off the part on the form about a mood disorder and he completely based off all of my issues on that. He asked me I was diagnosed with bipolar and I said yes. He actually checked me out and then gave me a 7 hour lasting melatonin pill and told me to use that. That's it. He thinks I should just take pills because I'm bipolar. I told him it's a misdiagnosis and I just need some sleeping pills but he denied and said I just need help with whatever symptoms I'm having in a psychiatric setting. I mentioned hallucinations but like it's common to have them when you aren't sleeping. Like it's obvious. [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1564903045

notafanofmath [info] I took Depakote for about four months, years ago, to treat chronic migraine. This was before I was diagnosed with bipolar, at the time Social Anxiety was my diagnosis, so I was also taking Paxil at the time (hopefully I’m remembering that correctly, it’s been a while.) Unfortunately for me, Depakote did almost nothing. I didn’t have any negative side effects but I also didn’t benefit from it either.  Hopefully it works better for you, and it’s possible that Paxil would have interfered with mine anyway. But I have known other people who got very positive results with it, so best of luck, I hope it helps you! [info] None [info] 1546724424

throwaway_emu_sla [info] Bipolar - mood stabilizers stop working There doesn't seem to be an Ask Psychiatry, so I'm posting here \(feel free to let me know otherwise\). I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but we have been struggling with finding an effective mood stabilizer \(a situation that is not uncommon, I realize\). What seems to happen is that a mood stabilizer will work great for a month or two, but then I will relapse. The nature of my episodes seem to change as each year passes \(ie. each fall/spring the cycling has become even more severe than the last year\) but it is difficult to tell if that is its natural course or if that's due to the many medication changes that have occurred. Every year, we have to try a new mood stabilizer or increase dosages. Is it usual to have a mood stabilizer work for a month, then not? I've tried three mood stabilizers and one antipsychotic \(Latuda\) so far. [info] None [info] 1528152004
Secondsemblance [info] Hey /r/askreddit, I'm thinking of doing something crazy, wondering if anyone else has tried this before I've begun to realize something about myself. My whole life has been preparing me for this decision. My childhood set me up to be a loner. I grew up on the side of a mountain in Pennsylvania, completely alone except for my family. I learned to live off the land. I can hunt, trap, fish, and I know how to survive. I've been training as an inland search and rescue specialist since I was 15. I joined the military at 17, and served for 3 years as an infantryman. I've logged 40 hours as a student pilot, and I flew my solo flight through a thunderstorm. I'm not afraid of death.A lot of things have changed the direction of my life recently. I was a college student with near perfect grades, planning to go to medical school. I finished 2 years of an undergrad biochemistry degree. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly after my life completely fell apart. Several things triggered it, but mainly I begun to realize what I was doing in the military was wrong, and my whole life was a lie. I received a medical discharge from the military, and I've felt pretty aimless and disillusioned since. There's only one group of people who I fit in with... dreamers. In the *Waking Life* sense of the word.Here's my plan. I'm going to settle everything here in my life, pack a rucksack, and leave everything behind. I'm going to hitch hike up north as far as I can, flying where I can, driving where I can, walking where I have to. I know my way around airports, and I know the people to talk to at FBOs to hitch hike on airplanes. I'm going to disappear and live off the land for as long as I can. If I end up dying, that's an outcome I can accept. But I feel like I need to strip everything away, and find clarity before deciding a direction for my life. I need to unlearn every bad habit that I've learned, and start over. Maybe I'll come back and finish my education. Maybe I'll find happiness out there somewhere and never come back. I don't know.Has anyone else done this? This plan is still in it's early stages. I would love advice. What are the biggest dangers, how to not be a target, how to not get arrested, how to tell my family that I'm going to disappear, etc. [info] None [info] 1313052556
lionhead99 [info] rant about my moods I was diagnosed with bipolar II at 16(F) I'm now 18 and i was taken off my medication (abilify) on april 26 to see how i do without it since i will be moving out of state for college and i have been doing very good the last 6 months or so. I have been trying to track my moods and I had a depressive episode from about april 30-may 9 and then i was stable until a few days ago. now i think I am swinging again but it is more intense than my old hypomanic episodes from what i remember. Basically high energy, talking fast and way too much, being super productive, and not sleeping as much which are usual hypo symptoms for me but I've also felt very sexual. My sex drive has gone completely through the roof like I wanted to have sex with some random dude that worked at the gas station and a few of my friends, had some dreams, etc. Ive spent $300 in the last week on crap i don't need and Ive been obsessively writing. Also my temper is ridiculous. Ive yelled at both my parents, my best friend, and a coworker. I got angry because of the wifi and punched the wall and then threw my trashcan against the wall till i broke it. My mom keeps asking why I'm so angry and I'm in such a rage so i needed to vent.

Nene_loves_it [info] Applying for disability: what do I need to know? Hello all! I am diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have been out of work for nearly 5 years. I have been able to survive because my spouse is employed. However, we have 3 children and I have a large amount of college debt. This is putting financial pressure on my husband and likewise on our relationship. So the question I have is, how do I apply for disability? I completed an online application, but what else do I need to do? Is there a way that I can ensure that I get approved? What are the tips and tricks you have used to get approved? Should I complete a paper application rather than the online form?  Basically, any information you can provide will help.I am not sure if this is relevant, but I have a felony conviction (not drug related) which limits my ability to get work. Basically, I am qualified to do a number of jobs, but my conviction prevents me from obtaining one that I would be suited to with my disability. Everything I can be hired for with the type of felony conviction I have (bartending, waiting tables, etc), is too overwhelming and stressful.Thanks so much! I’m sorry if this is too long and rambling. [info] None [info] 1547553863
ladyboylawrence [info] NMom hates Google or probably just me I've talked in one other post about AttorneyMom and now it's time for the reason her job is relevant.  This may be a bit long, as I just touched on it in therapy this week.I am a bright woman. That sentence took me five minutes to type because I'm afraid to call myself smart. Gifted burnout fits me better I think. I will be 28 this year and dropped out of high school at 18 just four credits shy of graduating in spite of a mess of drug addiction and roller coaster mental health issues. When I was 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 (learning at 25 how far off base this diagnosis was really changed a lot). I was always the intuitive, quizzical, top of the class kid. My fifth grade teacher bought me a tote bag to carry all my library books in. Then I dropped out of high school, because I honestly couldn't handle it anymore. My self esteem was shot (check comment history for more on NMom attacking anything from my appearance to my choice of clothes), I had never had a boyfriend because I had almost zero social skills. AM on the other hand did her undergraduate in psychology and runs a very successful firm. She is *obsessively* protective of her education. Because I dropped out of school so early and have had no friends for a decade and only two boyfriends, I learn. I watch university lecturers, read psychology journals, political pundits, history, medical curiousities, random facts, really any bit of information the internet can provide my ravenous brain. Here's the problem, if I participate in a conversation that makes me look bright in anyway, whether I accidentally call myself a smart girl (no you're not Larry, you don't even have an *education* I run a *law firm*) or mention that someone else called me smart (your father is an *uneducated loser* and isn't *smart* at all). The italics are to emphasize the disgust she uses all the time. I have tried so many times to finish my schooling over the years but I'm always met with mocking, ridicule and mother taking bets on when I'll drop out. She tells me what I can and can't handle, what I should and shouldn't study, she even told me I'm lying about being bisexual because I date men organically. My therapist finally had enough of "but my mom says," in session this week and laid it out on the table: I was diagnosed with CPTSD, BPD, DID, Anxiety in June 2017, in a little under two years I've almost completely done a 180. Biweekly therapy that I usually forget to go to isn't the cause of that. It's because my illnesses fascinated me and I spent weeks learning about how to care for them at home. I read books on mindfulness and learned about trauma processing. I can recognize triggers because I learned how to access the memories that caused them.Because I *am* smart. I *am* capable. My mother wants to keep me from flourishing because once I have my own education, she isn't better than me anymore. [info] None [info] 1550336118

halcyondazed88 [info] I keep seeing these distorted images and I’ll be honest. I debated whether or not I’d ever post this. I guess I was afraid writing about it would make it real, you know? I’m 23 and I live in Florida. I got my Bachelor’s in a big college town and officially moved there after graduation once I found work. I work as an entertainment news writer for a medium scale publication that I’ll keep anonymous for now, unless it becomes important in the future. It’s worth mentioning that I struggle with a fuckton in terms of my mental health. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years back and recently got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I mention this because I’m used to fighting off thoughts and going against my own brain. So, I’d like to think that this is all a symptom, something that will eventually disappear like a bad depressive episode. See, I’ve always had a wild imagination. I’ll see shapes and faces in things most people don’t, like tile floors and ceiling patterns and fabrics. Usually, these images are pretty harmless. Or at least they were. Not too long ago, I wrote an article about Judy Garland. Journalism can be a rather cold-blooded industry sometimes. We write about the dead after they’re gone with such coldness, laying out their every flaw for the world to see just for good SEO and web traffic. It’s brutal, but necessary for us to stay afloat. I was fighting off a bad depressive episode that night. I had absolutely no energy and struggled to do any more than just stay in bed and sleep all day. I knew my job was on the line, but that was barely enough motivation to inspire me to push myself. So, by the time the sun went down, I was still trying to make up for a full day of writing. I decided to try and cash in on the attention that the new Judy Garland biopic was getting by writing a memorial piece on the late actress. The writing itself being a nightmare because of my hazy brain. There’s this specific website full of entertainment related photos we’re licensed to use. It rarely actually has anything relevant to what you’re looking for but I figured there would be an image I could use somewhere. I scrolled through black and white pictures for some time until I finally found what I was looking for. But it caught me off guard. One of the images seemed... off. I was so exhausted that I couldn’t pinpoint what was wrong with it exactly, nor could I really process what I was seeing. It was a black and white picture of Judy Garland, smiling, but something was off about it. Her face just... didn’t seem right somehow. Her features were kinda twisted. Her smile was a bit too wide, her teeth seemed a bit too animal-like, and her eyes seemed far too dark. I stared at Judy trying to figure out what some internet asshole had done to her, and she stared right back. Unnerved, I quickly went to the next page to find another picture. Any other picture. On the next page, another off-putting image was there to greet me. Judy’s eyes were glazed and wild looking. They looked to be staring right at me, but seeing nothing. Her head was warped into an odd impossible shape with the angle, but it looked natural at first glance. From the feral way she grinned, I half expected the picture to jump out and bite me. I rubbed my eyes, thinking the image would snap back to normal after. It didn’t. Judy continued to stare with her animalistic teeth bared in a smile. What the hell did they do to you, Judy? As I scrolled, I kept finding more and more of these.... weird distorted images. It wasn’t long before I started seeing pieces of her face and her insanely feral grin in my sheets, my tapestries, my walls... I felt surrounded. It was nearing 3:00am and my lack of sleep was really beginning to eat at me. Creeped out and exhausted, I just quickly picked the most normal pictures I could find and closed out of the website. I suddenly stopped caring about my production quota. Something about those images had put me off my work. I curled up and went to sleep. At some point during the night, I woke up to an odd noise that reminded me of a cat wheezing up a hairball. The pictures of Judy had me more freaked out than I originally thought, so I tried to reach for my phone for some kind of eye bleach. But I couldn’t move. In the corner of my eye, I saw a shape. A large shape. A body laying on my floor. I wanted to move. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. I couldn’t move. But the body did. It slowly sat up and turned to my direction. It was too dark for me to see its features but it started to move toward me. It crawled into bed with me as I silently screamed for help. It came closer and closer and I began to notice it’s disturbing features. Flint black eyes that didn’t blink. Only stared back into my eyes, emotionlessly. A pale, bald head. And a row of feral, grinning teeth. It sat on my chest and stared down at me. I gasped for breath and tried to push it off, my body locked in fear. Its head inched closer and closer to mine, baring those horrible teeth... I then screamed myself awake from another nightmarish episode of sleep paralysis. When the fuck would it end, I wondered to myself with annoyance. I dug through my bedside drawer in search of my water pipe. A loud thumping noise caused me to jump and drop everything, spilling weed and bong water all over my bed. Damn neighbors, I thought. I got up and lazily cleaned the mess off my bed before stumbling into the bathroom for a quick smoke. I stared at myself in the mirror for a long time, trying to find distortions in my own face like I did Judy’s. Nothing. The thumping continued and I thought for a moment that there could be someone outside. I peeked through my curtains and didn’t see anyone. Right then, an odd dark shape quickly crawled past, like a spider. I quickly jumped away from the blinds, my heart in my throat. Go look, my brain ordered, stop being a coward. Against all my better instincts, I obeyed and slowly opened my front door...I could still see the spider-like thing running about through the field below my apartment. Though, I don’t think it could see me. I couldn’t tell what it was from a distance, but heard its snarl and decided to head back to bed before I freaked myself out anymore. I knew of a three-legged stray dog that often ran around the property after dark, and tried to convince myself that this was the explanation for the odd noises and unnatural movement of the creature. But the thing is, that thing outside moved too quickly even for a dog. I did my best to force it out of my mind, promising myself that I’d never walk around my complex this late out of fear of encountering that thing again. I drifted into a warm, yet uneasy sleep. I kept seeing the images and shapes in my head over and over and over. The spider creature. Judy’s smile. The body on my floor. I kept trying to use the binder of mindfulness skills from my treatment center, but the images continued to make their way into my brain. It’s been like this for weeks, guys, and I’ve barely slept. I can still see the large shape of a pale, twisted body sprawled out on my floor. I keep hearing all sorts of odd noises throughout the night like violent wheezing sounds and guttural croaks. I can’t find the source of them. Even now, I can’t rest and can’t sleep in my own room. These distorted images and sounds just keep getting worse and I think I’m going crazy. I’m going to try and get out of the house today. Maybe that will put my mind at ease. In the meantime, has anyone experienced anything like this? [info] None [info] 1570978874
Salty_goon [info] Depression is a motherfucker. Little backstory I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I've been struggling with it my whole life. I've survived three suicide attempts from when I was younger, and usually I'm pretty much a normal functioning 26 year old male. But these past two weeks have been hell. I've been waking up suicidally down to the point where I took off of work yesterday cause I woke up ready to jump in front of a train. I mean I'm sane enough to realize it's just my brain chemistry that's out of whack so I guess that's a good sign, but I'll be damned if it isn't hard to keep your mind off of it when it's mind beating you over the head with the idea of killing yourself. I worry most days cause in all honesty I have a lot to live for. Namely my daughter. I really try to hold on to that but idk these past few days have been particularly hard for me to stay on track.Today I'm feeling ok, a little emotionally numb but I'll take that over how I was yesterday. I'm gonna hit the gym hard today hopefully then have a tea party with my little one and pray that I can just wait this shit out. Smash your lifts, love your family, cause sometimes you don't realize how good you may have it. [info] None [info] 1459940025

FIGHTINGBP [info] Separated for almost 3 months. She still needs space... After 7 years (3 married) I moved out of OUR house in early November (mistake 1) I signed a separation agreement that essentially said I would pay for her car for 6 months and a loan that we got for our roof. (mistake 2) She is keeping everything in the house and our dogs. I have also been diagnosed with Bipolar right around the time of the separation. Part of the "space" she needed was because she didn't want to deal with my recovery and trying to get my meds right. We went to mediation last week and she was just replaying the same stories. She is trying to say that I am abusive and she is afraid of me. We both had our issues but I was never violent toward her. After mediation she just gave more boxes of my shit from her (my) car and stormed off. As she was driving away I brought up the fact that I didn't want to pay for her stuff. "That's being petty" She is also looking for a roommate. My family, therapist, lawyer, everyone is telling me to divorce. I just keep thinking one day....tl;dr left wife as I was diagnosed with bipolar, signed shitty separation agreement and now she continues to say she needs space while I pay for a car and separate loan in both our names.

AlwaysOdd33 [info] Been stable for so long that I feel like a different person I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 15 after coming down from a mixed episode that landed me the psych ward for a week. For the next year I was in and out of the hospital until I reached my rock bottom at the end of sophomore year when I was 16. I had ruined my relationship with my parents and horrible grades that made it nearly impossible to get into a decent college. My last hospitalization I had a therapist, let’s call her Marie, who was assigned to me after I was discharged. This therapist literally changed my life and helped me learn how to human again. She taught me how to cope with my depressive episodes, find other outlets to take instead of self harming, deal with my hypomania, and learn that I shouldn’t let my diagnosis define me. The last 2 years of high school I retook 2 classes I failed sophomore year, took 30 hours of dual enrollment classes, got onto the varsity girls choir class, and rebuild my relationship with my parents. After high school I went to a university near my parents house and got my degree in psychology in 4 years with a 3.2 GPA, research experience and a publication.  Right now I’m taking a year off to apply to masters programs. I consider myself to have been stable for 4 years, which is the time I spent in college. I didn’t have even the slightest breakdown these past 4 years and been out of the hospital for 6. I know I’m only 23 and there’s so many more years of living for me to do but right here right now I feel like being stable has made me into a different person. I don’t know any other version of me that isn’t this reckless, constantly depressed and suicidal. It’s like every day I’m going into new parts of myself, writing this new version of the woman I was always meant to be.It’s just a weird feeling and I’m writing this in hopes someone else has gone through something similar and/or has some insight on how to see this whole experience through a different perspective.

Apathetic_Doodles [info] Things are going to be very hard at times. I am 35 weeks pregnant and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14. I managed about six years ago to go off meds and until recently I had been fine. Make sure that she takes time for herself to relax and decompress. If she is like me she is fully aware of when things aren’t how they ought to be and she will probably be beating herself up about it already too, so just gently remind her that’s it’s okay to not be okay and that she isn’t broken, she just has an illness. I am certain since you guys are married you know her love language, so when she is struggling do what you can to make her feel loved. Some people need gifts, even small ones like a candy bar from the gas station. Some people appreciate service so do something nice like a chore she would normally do. If she wants to talk it out then do that, cuddle if she want/needs to cuddle. It’s going to be hard but you can do it. Also don’t be afraid to go back on meds if needed, there are options that are totally safe to take while pregnant. [info] Team Pink! EDD 8-18 [info] 1531764822

cassannmi [info] Should I (22 F) get back with my son's father (23 M) to be financially stable again? Basically my ex and I had our own place, was financially independent, and managed to take care of ourselves for over a year. To make a long story short: I had an unplanned pregnancy, my ex cheated on me while I was pregnant and after, so I left him and became a single mom. I'm back living with my parents and I feel like such a burden. I'm enrolled back in college after taking a year off, but my current job doesnt pay very much ($9.25 per hour). I know I need to find a higher paying job but it's tricky to find one that's as lenient with my college schedule. I know the obvious answer is to not get back with the asshole. I just feel like there's no way I can support myself and my son on my own at least until I graduate, and I feel ashamed on having to lean on my parents. Not to mention I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and when all of this was happening I fell apart and got into a manic phase where I got myself 5k in credit card debt.

absolutelystarving [info] Mixed feelings after new psych visit This group is really lovely and I appreciate that it exists. I hope I can still stay after this, I had a weird experience with a new psychiatrist that confused me about my diagnosis.  Today I had my first appointment with a new psychiatrist (video call) and overall it was a really heavy but productive appointment. One thing that bothered me was that she was very quick to say in the first 10-15 minutes was that she didn't think I had bipolar disorder, and that it sounded more like I have BPD. But then over the course of the appointment as she listened to me more, she walked it back multiple times and said "But you could have both!" I'm so confused. I was diagnosed with bipolar 6 years ago and it seemed to make a ton of sense to me, and it gave me a foundation for understanding myself better that was really important to me. I've been operating with the understanding that I have bipolar disorder for years and now I feel like I've been lying to the people around me. Ultimately, the point of the appointment was mostly to discuss meds. I was happy to hear that the psychiatrist does still think Abilify is appropriate for me, whether I have bipolar or BPD or whatever, and she OK'd a dose increase. So I guess I feel bad about the diagnosis confusion but I guess in the end I should be happy that I'm still on the right meds? Is there anyone in this group that has bipolar AND BPD? I know very little about BPD but I'm going to spend some time on NAMI and read about it. [info] None [info] 1588289889
trollfairy [info] Hey buddy, First I applaud the courage thus far we are all so unique and what your dealing with is nothing to be ashamed of. It is the way you were born. I honestly recommend owning it. God if you believe in him or if not let's say the universe has a way of presenting us each with situations we need to face that allow us to grow as human beings. Don't take that opportunity away from your parents. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I never wanted to tell anyone and I still hide it to some extent because our Indian community is judgemental. But that's selfish we should talk about such things openly because 1. We have no reason to be ashamed and 2. It gives others an opportunity to grow. Talk to them about it-- I think you'll be surprised with how supportive they are. It'll be awkward but it'll bring you closer together.Sincerely,A friend of Trollfairy [info] None [info] 1506288828

from_the_black_hole [info] I have bipolar 2 disorder.  I take Lamictal.Don't take an SSRI if you have bipolar disorder.Having bipolar disorder makes you prone to addiction.  You have to really understand your illness and don't fall into the cliche.  You need to find the gifts inside your illness.  I don't like when people romanticize bipolar disorder and mental illness, but us bipolars are usually geniuses in one way or another.You have to find a reason to quit.  I always get horrible cravings and it seems literally impossible to quit until 48 hours after my last smoke.  I personally think smoking affects my medication's effectiveness and after abstaining for a few days, I feel like my mood levels out and I find less reasons to want to smoke.Bipolar is hard.  People don't understand it.  You'll lose most of your friends, you'll spend a lot of time alone.  You have to learn to love yourself and get proper treatment with medication that won't make you groggy or feel out of it.  You'll need to have a consistent sleep schedule and diet.  You'll need to exercise and stay productive.  Avoid caffeine as well.  Try to avoid any psychoactive drugs.  You want your brain chemistry to remain consistent so you can learn to identify your mood cycles.I've been through it all and kicking pot is a real challenge for me because I use it to self medicate.  It makes me unproductive and I've lost a few years of my life just smoking to mask my illness.  I'm the same age as you; my parents don't believe I have bipolar disorder and thought I was making it up.  My parents are both hoarders and were severely emotional abusive and negligent.  I dealt with self harm and considered suicide many times over the past 5 years.  Once I turned 18 I was able to go to a psychiatrist on my own and get diagnosed and treated.  My parents never ask or care about my mental illness or the medication I was prescribed.  I remember being 18 year old and telling them I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and they gave me an awkward stare, grabbed a beer from the fridge, rolled their eyes and walked off.Not to go on about a sob sorry of my life, but in case someone else reads this because of the title,Before I knew I was bipolar I was self harming every day and considering suicide every day from age 16-18.  Child protective services came to my house because my school guidance counselor suspected something was up and I broke down and told them everything going on in my life and at home.  She tipped off CPS and they contacted my parents.  My mom unleashed an angry tirade on me and forced me to clean the entire house before their scheduled visit.  At the time I had no friends except for a girl who talked to me on the phone and texted me for hours every day pretending to like me.  I fell in love because she was the only person I had.  Typical teenage girl bullshit went down and it turned out she was just using me for attention; she loved talking to me and hearing me tell her how much I loved her and she would pretend to be interested in me but she wasn't.The bad living situation and emotional trauma on top of being untreated for a severe mental illness caused my grades to suffer and it took me an extra two years to graduate, I had to set myself up with an alternative education to graduate once I was 18.  Since I wasn't able to go to college I had to work minimum wage jobs with demanding hours and high stress which set my bipolar off.  For the past few years all I have been doing is smoking pot to deal with all of this past trauma.  It seems impossible to get out of it. [info] None [info] 1437460907

b-ray9969 [info] I am in a very similar situation myself. I live with my parents and they pay for my college as well.About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so I can relate to mental health interfering with schoolwork. You should definitely speak with a counselor about mental health resources that the school offers. My diagnosis gives me access to the schools Disability Department which gives me priority registration, and other amenities to accommodate my disorder like extra testing time, ability to test in a private room, deadline extensions etc.As well, if you talk to your teachers and explain your situation, they are usually really understanding and may give you an Incomplete for the class, which allows you to finish the class the next semester with no penalty to your transcript.I am on academic probation myself. My school has academic probation 1, 2, and then the third semester you are “suspended” from the school for a semester. If after you are readmitted, and don’t bring your gpa up, you are then banned for 5 years from the college. So if your school is like mine, you have a couple more semesters to fix your gpa.Take care of yourself and do what you need to take control of your mental health. YOU and YOUR needs should take priority in your life.Good luck. Everything will work out with time. [info] None [info] 1557714417
onceblue [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before being diagnosed with ADHD. The bipolar diagnosis never sat right with me, but I couldn't figure out what else it could be, so that was my label for a while. Because I did well in school, I didn't think I had much of a problem with focus/distractability until I ended up in the working world and everything started unraveling for me. I think the added responsibility of the working world plus the fact that everything isn't laid out neatly on a syllabus way ahead of time is what really tested my ADHD (although I was still a chronic procrastinator, even back then). Also, once I started having important meetings, I realized I would zone out during conversations and miss chunks. I always assumed I would zone out during conversations because I merely was disinterested, but I would actually try very hard to pay attention during meetings and still have trouble. That's how I ended up discussing it with my psychriatrist and ultimately getting diagnosed. I have had hyperactive symptoms that have persisted into adulthood (running around, being ridiculously goofy, being unable to sit still) and these were previously misdiagnosed as mania. When I take Adderall, they completely go away. In fact, I even feel a little sleepy on adderall, but I don't think it's a "real" sleepiness. I think it just feels that way because some of my energy finally gets mitigated. Anyway, the point of all of this is that I don't think it's black-and-white. I think plenty of people learn coping skills to help them get through everyday life that makes it even harder to distinguish ADHD from other disorders.  [info] None [info] 1436379034
drippingrubies [info] I've never wanted children and figured out pretty young that something was wrong with me. I was an absolute wreck and had parents that were very judgemental of people with mental illness and didn't like us showing emotion. I started being suicidal when I was 9. Early this year, I was diagnosed with bipolar and some other stuff after years of covering it up and feeling ashamed. I'm finally stable and it's reconfirmed my decision to be child free. I will not risk putting a child through this. I can not go off meds to have a child because I would be both a risk to myself and the spawn. I would not be a good mother for so many reasons, not just my mental illness. I hope you continue to be well, friend.  [info] None [info] 1541660980
soundofwinter27 [info] Wondering if anyone else has had these unusual symptoms on lithium? Hello! First off I want to say I was just diagnosed with bipolar today. Reading through this Reddit I started crying because all of the crazy things that I've always done that no one can relate to are on this page and I feel as if my mental state is validated. I have a group of people that think similarly to me. Second, I am superrrrr sensitive to medication so I was put on the lowest dose of lithium I could take. I took it and about 30 mins after I began getting muscle spasms, a headache, restlessness, nausea, hand cramps and dizziness. I peed four times in three hours and I ran into a wall walking back to bed. On top of all this, I was told lithium helps with sleep, and it is currently 3 am and I feel like I could run a marathon. This all makes me nervous to waste my time and money on a bunch of meds that are just going to make me feel horrible..... I haven't found anyone else online saying they have had this reaction and I was just wondering if someone else has had a similar experience. [info] None [info] 1512549466

I was in hospital coming off Cymbalta, so at least I had medical professionals watching out for me. I think I am still experiencing withdrawal effects (one month later still!). I was on Lamictal as well but I'm off that too now. (I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 but now my doctor is saying that maybe I don't have bipolar! So confusing!)

claireplane [info] For me, it was all about fighting the urge, realizing I needed healthier chipping mechanisms, and reaching out to therapists and others who had stopped. I had a moment where I really wanted to cut, but I immediately stopped myself and I said, "this will not make the situation any better and I'm ready to get better." I must say, though, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been on medicine and done a lot of therapy, so that is likely to have helped. If you ever need to talk, I'm here...

mother-of-puppies [info] Family is using my diagnosis as an excuse to not take me seriously 😢 Hey you guys. Fist of all I really love how supportive this subreddit is, and I was wondering if I could ask you guys for some advice. So I was diagnosed with bipolar II two months ago and my medication seems to start working, I feel more stable. Yet, something I’ve always had that hasn’t gone away is that I’m really sensitive and get easily hurt. I complained to my sister last week that it upsets me that she’s always on her phone while we’re doing stuff together (at a cafe, watching a movie) and yesterday I told my father in law that he was hurting my feelings by always answering stuff I tell him with comments like “I don’t know about that” and “that sounds like nonsense”. I know this is pretty harmless stuff but it really hurts my feelings. In the past when I’ve expressed these feeling my family usually apologised or brushed my comments off, but now they’re getting really mad at me and accusing me of letting my mental illness hang out and not controlling my mood disorder. Both times this happened recently I was so shocked by their reaction that I instantly apologised and both times was told something to the effect of “wow, it’s so great to see that your illness is healing!”. I wish I had never told them about my diagnosis because I feel like they’re using it as an excuse not to take me seriously. The funny thing is my friends have been nothing but supportive, even when we disagree. Does anyone else have experience with this? I would appreciate any advice. [info] None [info] 1577103453

madison_eevee [info] Mixed Episode- What does this mean? Hey guys!&amp;#x200B;So, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I when I was 19, and I'm almost 22 now. I've dealt with it okay, and I haven't been on medication in about a year due to some not preventable circumstances. I've been on a manic upswing since late November/early December and it's been the typical not sleeping, too much energy, spending money, etc. WELL, last week, I suddenly felt more depressed and just straight up anxious than I have in, gosh, I'd say a year or so, even on a downswing. Like, it was to a scary, very uncomfortable degree, and I feel pretty much back to where I was now. I don't think it was situational as nothing was going on that was out of the ordinary, and I usually cycle every four months so I don't think that was it either.&amp;#x200B;I just want to know if this is normal or what I should do or how to avoid this. It's never happened during a manic episode before, and I had no idea what to do. I admittedly don't know a lot about bipolar disorder really, and this isn't something I feel comfortable talking to my family about. Is this what a mixed episode is? [info] Manic [info] 1548317804

peasantsean [info] I hope this doesn't get too buried, I might be able to help. This story sounds all to familiar to me and I hate to admit it but I really think sharing my thoughts might be of some use. Your bf sounds exactly like the type of guy I was to my ex. The relationship started off great but soon became overwhelmingly toxic. I was very emotionally abusive/controlling. She was the nicest person I have ever met and put up with it for so long because she empathized with my struggles with mental illness. During that time I didn't want to admit I had any issues, in my head everything was her fault. But after a few escalated incidents(similar to your bf - just doing stupid dangerous abuse tactics) I felt like something had to be going on in my head. I knew something was weird with my reactions to things that shouldn't have warranted such a strong reaction. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which makes sense since it runs in the family. But that's not an excuse for the way I acted. That was a starting point to figuring out how to grow. I knew I was abusive. I knew I didnt want to be, and now I knew my manic and depressive episodes contributing to my lack of self worth probably werent helping the situation get any better. &amp;#x200B;Let me just tell you, it WILL NEVER get better. The more you put up with his crap the worse it gets. He needs help. So good on you for finally ending it. You made the best decision possible. Your feelings towards the decision are understandable but please do a lot of research on domestic violence to get some context. &amp;#x200B;So back to a little background on my story: I started to resent myself for being so abusive. Which made the relationship even worse. Every time I couldnt control my anger or be the ideal partner to her I would self harm hoping itll teach me a lesson and id learn to get better one day. And it became this horrible cycle of me abusing her and myself until one day I snapped. We got into an argument and I left her house and sliced up my arm pretty good. I wasnt trying to kill myself, just take control of my emotions...or get help...or maybe even manipulate her?? idk really. But her dad took me to the hospital and I got 19 stitches. Her parents were very supportive of me getting treatment but didnt want me so close to their daughter anymore. The best thing that happened to me was going in and out of psych wards until I found treatment that actually helped. Also, letting go of that relationship so we can both heal was a step in the right direction. It was the only way(looking back on the situation now) that I see the abuse would have ever stopped. &amp;#x200B;I believe 100% that as long as you guys are in each other's lives neither one of you will move on to a healthier future. I now have a daughter and am in a loving relationship with somebody else. There's no abuse on either side and we're constantly growing. But that's because I had to admit I had issues and learn to grow/move on from them. The best thing you can do for yourself is accept the fact that you deserve MUCH better. It's time for you to heal. Do not visit him in the hospital. Dont have any contact with him at all. Its going to be tough but its completely necessary for your safety and well-being. Reach out to some support during this process. Maybe look into getting therapy. Join some sports clubs, find hobbies. Keep yourself distracted and moving forward. &amp;#x200B;So yeah, I dont think domestic violence ever gets better. It ends badly. Personally I think I got lucky by being so passionate about not being an abuser that I forced myself to cut contact with my ex even after she initiated contact months later. He needs to admit he's abusive(to himself), learn to grow and then move on. If he honestly cares about you he'd leave you alone to prevent from causing any more damage. But just like I was, he's manipulative af and cares more about himself. &amp;#x200B;Accept your decision to leave him. And learn to love it. It probably saved your life. &amp;#x200B;Also, if anyone is curious why I think I was abusive, I was thinking about this recently. I think it all came down to the fact that I was very weak. Of course there were a combination of other factors(seeing abuse growing up, mental illness, never learning a healthy way to express emotions etc). But I was weak and had no self worth. So control was the only way I think I found any sort of comfort. It started off small. Like getting annoyed when she talked to other dudes. Then it escalated into full blown screaming at her, attacking her self worth and preventing her from going certain places or speaking to certain people. I hated doing it. But I didnt know any other way. If I knew then what I know now I'd see those early signs of weakness in myself and be mature enough to say "hmmm, getting this jealous isnt a good sign for our future. Maybe I shouldnt be in a relationship at this time..." So, if any of you see those ealry signs in yourself or in a partner really look into ways you can improve the situation. It wont improve on its own.  [info] None [info] 1538924035

Brocktreee [info] I read both posts. The biggest thing that stuck out to me is that you have a relative with schizoaffective disorder. I don't know how much you know about that, so:Schizoaffective is a blend of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and when I'm manic, I get paranoid that I'm going to be attacked, I see things out of the corner of my eye, very anxious, agitated, it's bad. I don't hallucinate outside of mood states. Schizophrenic hallucinations and delusions/paranoia can happen outside of mood episodes. There's a lot more to mania than I'm getting into here, suffice to say that it's a very nasty combination.**Let me be absolutely clear:** I am not saying you have bipolar, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.I am saying that because you have a relative, the risk of you developing one of these is higher. You have an underlying vulnerability that people unrelated to you don't have.**Let me be clear:** I am not a licensed mental health professional, just a psychology and drug education buff.That said, it is absolutely crucial that you seek emergency mental health assistance ASAP. You are not well psychologically, and you need help in getting stabilized.

captainmittens [info] A question about identity, and then an interesting happening in my family. Something's been bothering me for quite a while. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost year and a half ago now. The fact that I have bipolar disorder is on my mind pretty much all the time. I have long drives to school and work almost every day and listen to music and somehow it all reminds me; I relate it all to the bipolar without trying. It's with me at work and at school and at the grocery store and at the movie theater.Is it just like this? Will it go away in time? I keep reminding myself, "I am not my disorder," but with this playing on repeat, it gets very frustrating.Anyway, something interesting happened when I spoke to my mom on the phone today. I have been the subject of a lot of discussion and excitement for my family states away, since I'm getting married later this year back home. Suddenly I'm in contact with extended family. I'd always been the black sheep but the extended family is very close, until I moved away for school and stopped communicating. I guess I just didn't know how to keep up those relationships that were already strained due to my unmanaged disorder.My aunt has been particularly involved in the planning. Out of nowhere last week, she asked my mother if I had talked to my cousin (her daughter) about anything. Her daughter has a doctorate in psychology and is a therapist, and it was implied that perhaps I'd talked to her about a mental issue, as people do occasionally come to her with questions.Well, yes. My immediate family knows, my grandmother, and the cousin. Today my mom asked if I would think about opening it up to the rest of the family. She was surprised when I immediately said yes.Maybe it has to do with the above. It's part of my life and there's no denying it. Maybe if they know they will be more understanding; maybe it will help our relationships. Maybe when I go home for Christmas and don't join them in all-day shopping trips to the mall, there will be less eye-rolling. Or when I call my mom and she's with a large crowd of family and she tries to pass the phone around and I beg her not to, or when I text or email an aunt or uncle on their birthday instead of calling, they won't be offended.Mental illness is generally dismissed in our family as a problem with a relationship with god, or alcoholism or drug use. This could go either way but I hope it ends in education. Besides, if anyone is suffering, they don't need to do it alone like I did. [info] None [info] 1400649510

Shivoe [info] Holy crap! I have had issues with my bipolar and dr' s, as well as not being taken seriously about complications when I got the paregard as well.I was diagnosed with bipolar at 12, and they thought the best course of action was to rapid cycle me through meds every 2-3 weeks to see what worked instead of 6-12 weeks. They resulted in me being either extremely manic or completely suicidal and never finding a middle ground. That went on from age 12 to 16 until my parents divorced and I moved in with my father.After my second was born I got the paregard and about a week later my entire body, neck to the bottoms of my feet, was covered in massive hives and no one would believe me that it was the paregard!

captainelf [info] Why do I keep losing weight without trying to? Hi guys. I have no idea where to really put this question, any help will be valued.I'm 26,and I weigh less now than I did at age 18. I'm 1,72m tall, and I weight 74kg then. Now I weigh 63, the least that I have ever weighed. But I keep losing weight.My health background:I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and fibromyalgia at age 19. My meds was changed about two years ago from Nuzac to Lexamil. The doctors also prescribe me a lot of prednisone.I'm asking because my mother-in-law keeps commenting on my loss of weight and saying how unhealthy it is. I don't think it's a problem, seeing as my metabolism is super fast and am under a ton of stress and pressure.  It makes sense to me that I keep losing weight. Depression tends to curb your appetite, but I still eat a lot. I'm talking in the sense that I drink 1l of Coca Cola a day.My question is why do I keep losing weight without trying to?

aerikson [info] This is probably going to be buried but whatever.I was a fit and active kid growing. I played organized baseball and soccer, plus football, cops and robbers, etc etc with my friends in the neighborhood as often as I could. My mother stayed at home and made sure I ate healthy for the majority of my meals. I didn't drink much soda and the only junk food I got was when my friends and I got some extra money and bought some at the grocery store after school. Then, when I turned 11, my mother left, leaving me with my father. I don't remember much of that summer, but it was not the typically fun and active summer I usually had. Because of the various things that happened, I quit many of the things that I used to love, including soccer, baseball, and piano. Because my dad worked long hours and commuted at least two hours a day, he often was unable to feed me properly, and even if he could, he was not a good cook. So, if we did eat at home, it was something awful like Hamburger Helper, but more often, it was pizza or McDonalds. That same year, my father and I moved to a different neighborhood. While I stayed in the area somewhat near my friends, I was far enough away that I didn't really want to go for the long walk and meet up with them. So, that lack of any social activity not only took away the last bit of common physical exercise it got, it also depressed the hell out of me.Over the next 6 years or so, my life was mostly video games, junk food, and mental health problems. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (probably from my mother who I rarely saw then nor do I see now) and put on drug after drug after drug. The most significant being Lithium, which I think had a major effect on my weight. I don't really hold anyone responsible for the drugs though as I was an awful child, often skipping school and reacting aggressively towards others. I got expelled from three schools from the ages of 11-15.As I got older, my diet and physical activity level still remained unhealthy. I did start getting more active once I dropped out of school and started to work full time. Most of the work was very physically demanding which was wonderful, but with my own income and now a car, I usually made up for the increase in exercise with even worse food. Mentally and socially, I got better as well though, as I met new friends through work and have been able to stay sane without drugs since the age of 17.It was this year that I actually decided to change my lifestyle and become a physically active adult who eats healthy. Last year, two of my best friends got married and went to Disney World during their honeymoon. They wanted to go again and bring their friends along. Knowing I would be wary of going since my size not only made air travel uncomfortable but made some rides impossible for me to go on, they said they would pay the whole way if I lost weight. They never said how much or how I should, they just said lose weight. It took a few months for that offer to kick in, but I realized, why the fuck not?So, starting in April of this year, I picked up a low carb and low calorie diet, started working a very physically active job, and found myself at the gym once a day. On April 20th, 2012, when I started this whole mess, I weighed myself at 389 lbs. As of yesterday, I weigh 255 lbs. No lies, no bullshit. Most of the time, I don't believe myself, but I did it. I'm not going to say it was easy, because that isn't fair to other people who are doing the best they can to lose weight, but it is possible to lose weight. [Here is a picture of me from my aforementioned friends' wedding and a picture of me last month](http://i.imgur.com/QUw9e.jpg). I will also be happy to say that my friends and I went down to Orlando two weeks ago for five days at Disney World and Universal Studios and I had an amazing time (even better when they're paying!).

I_wanted_truth [info] Most definitely. I think folks like us experiencing this relief/freedom have to watch out for when the "natural high" of quitting wears off. And I should have mentioned earlier that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 10 years ago in my early 20s after being arrested after a very manic period. I tend toward the mania and don't really seem to have deep depressive periods. I've been unmedicated (or self medicated with weed) basically since then, though weed actually increases my mania and energy to some extent. I actually have more energy now, but it's clean and focused, if that makes any sense. Such an interesting journey life is! And so weird when a decade of your (my) identity comes from cannabis. And the simultaneous hiding it from my profession and colleagues. When I look back, though, I'm not sure if it could have been any other way. This was my path.  [info] None [info] 1383623718
25491494 [info] Struggling to get life insurance (25/F) Hi all! Not sure if this is the right place to come but I’m at my wits end..I’ve tried and so far been unsuccessful to get life insurance. Myself and my fiancé have just moved into our first house together and whilst getting his life insurance sorted would be fairly straightforward, mine is an absolute nightmare. I’m a female, non smoker, non drinker. Aged 25. Sadly, I tried to commit suicide in August ‘16 leading to me being sectioned until October ‘16. Whilst an inpatient I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I’ve been on a number of medications since then, although this has now been reduced to just two. This seems to be the big problem for most insurance companies. Does anyone have any similar experiences and/or company recommendations? Really struggling here and not really sure what to do! Even my financial advisor is struggling. [info] None [info] 1553875156

anzasage [info] When I was her age, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on mood stabilizers. My boyfriend at the time told me that he didn't like me on them because I was a bitch and that he didn't think they were helping. I stopped taking them. It was 100% the wrong thing to do. He was an ass and I only regret not breaking up with him sooner.I'm not saying you will do anything like that to encourage her to stop taking her meds but if you notice any negative changes to her personality, gently encourage her to work on her dosage or try another type of medication.

Reformed0852 [info] Yes. I was in South-3-A, the locked down controlled psych block of our county jail. I was facing charges because the police officer charged me with battery on a police officer and resistance with violence when he tackled me even though I actually didn't do anything at all. I never committed a crime, and I was in my house when the officer arrived. I ended up beating the case on an insanity plea, and was transferred from jail to a psych ward. They released me to my mother and then I admitted myself to the in-patient mental health facility where I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at the age of 17. It was there that I recovered, and to an extent I am still recovering to this day, but overall I am doing much better and live a happy life. [info] None [info] 1498693109

For me, it explained so much in my life. I had been struggling for a long time but I never had the vocabulary to talk about what I was experiencing. “I’m so stressed out” was a common excuse for why I felt the way I did. Sure, it was true. But there was more going on. I have learned a lot since being diagnosed and I have been open and talking about it. And two years later, they deny that I’m going through anything.

vsoprano10 [info] Ultra manic and irritable every holiday I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1 mixed. For the last four years, I have become unpleasant manic with strong irritably where I am throwing things, yelling, and hiding upstairs so my extended family doesn't see me yelling, though I know I'm not hiding it well. My family has tried to help me by providing quiet, small, and non-stressful holidays, but the same thing happens. I'm getting to where I dread holidays because either I will feel miserable because I'm so irritable or I'll feel guilty later for being manic and making everyone else's holiday horrible. I'm about ready to not celebrate at all with how miserable they are for everyone because of me.

princess_monochokeme [info] Bipolar 2 and sex. So I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have been on lamictal since September &amp; Seroquil for 2-3 weeks. I used to be impulsive sexually. I used to have sex with people quick into meeting them. I used to not use condoms. I used to have a rotation of men &amp; women I regularly slept with. I've done things I'm not proud of. I have a history of sexual abuse throughout my life so idk if that ties into this. Ever since my meds, I've been less horny and more focused on going on actual dates as opposed to having sex. I've had sex with maybe 3 people since I've been on meds and only one was able to get me off.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 16 and again at 24, but none of the mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics did anything positive for me (but thanks to lithium I have a fine tremor for the rest of my life, so that’s fun) As a last ditch effort my psych put me on Wellbutrin. Finally I showed improvement, (when Wellbutrin became my sole psych med I began to question my bipolar diagnosis, considering taking an SNRI is usually counter indicated due to risk of mania, which never happened), but I’m still having symptoms that are making my life difficult.

CuriousQuill [info] Only love can hurt like this. Unrequited love, at seventeen, will affect your brain chemistry just as much as the roll call of substances you've taken for the pain. When your heart gets emptied out like that, you do what you need to fill it up. A broken heart leaks though, so you keep on pouring the shit in... and your heart doesn't heal. I hope you can keep up your sobriety. You have a lot of insight. I was suicidal when I was 30, after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I thought my life was over. The next 10 years were a struggle. And life still is a struggle. But those 10 years were also filled with life and love and genuine happiness at times, and although they were hard to live I am glad I lived them - even the really shitty parts. Bad experiences make for good stories: today's catastrophe is tomorrow's amusing anecdote. And remember: you are only a truly rounded human being if you have had your heart broken.

Bpn2019 [info] Getting worse? Is it even Bipolar? I was diagnosed with bipolar years ago and just started seeking treatment. I’m still learning of course. My question is the paranoia. It’s making me upset, angry. Almost constantly. I can’t look in a mirror because I don’t trust the reflection and I can’t stand photos. It’s slowly turning into a fear. My thoughts are so scattered throughout the day, but I work hard to focus. It’s not always something I’m capable of. My question is why is my paranoia getting so bad. When I’m driving I’m convinced I’m being followed. I feel like I’m being monitored constantly. Like an experiment.  When I’m in public I feel like I’m being stalked. I feel like people can read what I’m thinking. It’s unsettling. I don’t know what else to explain. I’m afraid to almost, like someone will know. [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1560790658

ittyxbitty [info] My green day story. Green day has been playing in the background of my life for as long as I can remember. My oldest sister has been a huge fan since dookie. Because of this I have always been aware of them and since becoming a fan in my own right it seems they've put out music I just happen to need at that point in my life.In 2005 I entered high school, started those weird, awkward, and sometimes horrifying teen years, my parents got divorced, and the Jesus of suburbia became my savior. My father was severely depressed, my mother moved in with her side piece, and I was lost. The anger, pain, and sense of rebellion that poured out of American idiot brought me back.A few years later 21st century breakdown dropped right in the middle of my own personal breakdown. My mother had given up on me since I wouldn't fit myself into what her idea of a daughter should be, my dad worked a Lot and I was alone 80% of the time, I was a senior in high school and I thought i was going insane. Turns out I was. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was riding the tide of trying to find the right medication and attempted to kill myself. I left the hospital a week later and received a therapist from my mother and 21st century breakdown from my sister. The therapist helped a bit but the music helped more. Then I got pregnant and that album carried me through the Terror of becoming an adult and mother. In 2012 I hit a really rough patch. I had just turned 21, I was trying to get a hold on my mental health and raise a 2 year old. We can all agree that a Lot of the trilogy was bad but the lightheartedness mixed with serious and emotional songs was exactly what I needed as I navigated the stormy sea that was my mind. After billie joes meltdown green day fell off my radar a bit.Then 2016 happened. I saw the lyric video for bang bang on Facebook. My sister called to tell me about the AMAs (No KKK no facist USA no trump). Then my father ended up in the hospital. He had to undergo a quadruple bypass on his heart which then got severely infected and he was placed in a coma for almost 3 weeks. During one of the many long drives to the hospital still breathing came on the radio and that song broke me. For the first time since he had been admitted I cried. I had a panic attack. Then I felt better, because I was a mother barely holding it together but I was still breathing. And so was my dad. He got better. Things got better.I listened to rev rad in its entirety and it resparked my mild obsession with the band. I received tickets to see them for the first time on my birthday and I cried when they played still breathing. And yes I had the time of my life. By no means has green day been the only music to get me through but they have been the most consistent. Even though I've never met them it feels like they're old friends. Even though they have no idea, we've been through a Lot together. They were my friends when I had none.I grew up in a very musical household. I heard country from my mother, rap from my brother, pop from my middle sister, classic rock from my dad, and punk from my oldest sister. Green day is the band I credit my life to even though plenty of other music has helped me along the way. Green day is the only band I feel an emotional attachment to. I feel proud of them like a person would feel proud seeing their best friend succeed in life. Their passion, and how far they've come yet how humble they remain and how open they are with their fans makes me feel as if I know them personally and I'm so excited to see where they go next.I suck at endings so I'll leave it at that. I would love to hear others stories as well. How you found them, why they stuck with you, how they helped you. If you made it this far, thanks for hearing me out.*edited to add that I completely forgot it was Sunday. [info] None [info] 1505068606

ReddyLee [info] I met my husband at 19 and thought I wanted children at the time.  Though, I was confused and conflicted about a lot of my beliefs.  I was Catholic, but didn't feel that fit me right.  I was struggling to come out publicly to my family and friends (I'm bisexual.)  there were a lot of fundamental beliefs to contend with at the time.  I solved the bisexual outing first...kind of the low hanging fruit.  Next I danced with childfree and my husband was supportive.  Then I put that idea back in a box and continued wanting children.  Meanwhile, i came out as an atheist and I went back to college.  I got a degree in psychology.  During this process, I finally solidified my childfree decision.My husband and I decided our life should be a childfree one.  I was about 27 at this point.  I finished college at 29.  And I succumbed to my uterus' desperate plea for me to grow a baby in it.  My husband was reserved, but on board.  Then three months later, I decided that my major medical issues (gut stuff) made me unfit to carry a child and I had always thought of myself as someone who would adopt, not conceive.  So we adjusted the plan and started looking into adoption.Then I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  This didn't automatically stop the adoption process for us, but we did have to pause and take stock of our lives and the practicality of parent a child or children with one of us having mental illness.  We decided that without our support network in place and our access to resources, that we could totally proceed with adoption safely.Then we thought about it a little more and realized that it wouldn't be fair to depend on a support network and it wouldn't be fair to a child.  We also recognized that living childfree is something that we loved for 10 years already, so why consider changing that?  We decided to commit all our love and devotion to each other instead of having children.  My hormones calmed down enough for my heart to have a chance to be heard.  And it said it didn't want to be a parent.  I think I wanted to be childfree all along, but I really knew after truly considering and investigating the process.  The hormones were overwhelming me.  It was all I could think about for a while there.  My body's biological needs were really trying to be met! But once they calmed down a bit, my heart and my head were able to finally figure it all out.  It was about 11 years total with the up and down.  Mostly knowing I wanted to be CF, but occasionally getting confused.Tl;dr I want 29 when the CF lifestyle and I fully clicked, despite my ladyparts' best efforts.

yaosio [info] I used to yell and scream and threaten to kill myself as a little yaosio. I had no problem physically attacking my parents, but I never damaged anything because I would feel bad knowing somebody would have to clean up the mess. I think I hated my parents as much as a little kid could hate their parents because I was an angel at school and around everybody else. My parents changed nothing and I grew out of it. A child psychologist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder, but then it turned out he wasn't actually licensed. Later in life I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a licensed psychologist.How it presents is completely different today than as a little me. I would cry at the slightest frustration and become very angry but only directed at my parents. Now I am depressed all the time and get very anxious when I am frusturated. Very particular frustrations make me angry instantly, like bad UI design.So now you know what that dude does can be an innate trait regardless of parenting. [info] 💩 poster [info] 1519295665
JoosMoose [info] Something that discouraged me was the sheer amount of schooling, and also everyone telling me that I'd burn out working in a field like that.  I mean, I'm sure it is hard seeing dead people every day, some of whom were young or met with foul play or whatever else.As a teen I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and school got really hard for me as I tried to learn to cope with that.  I think that convinced me that I couldn't handle all the schooling required for something like that if I couldn't even get through sophomore year of high school, haha.  So that dream kinda fell to the wayside and when I did go to college I got interested in anthropology (archaeology especially).  But then I got interested in the hard sciences and medicine again, and now I'm a certified phlebotomist because why not.I think I will go back to school for something else eventually, but I doubt it'll be to become a medical examiner at this point in my life.

Weissach [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I have my master's and have been working in that field for roughly 4 years now. Historically I did the 2 years at one place thing (since undergrad), but it was mostly because better opportunities presented themselves. I have been working for the government for a little over 2 years but in different positions (recent change). I've gotten lucky and have had really understanding/supportive coworkers and supervisors, so the BP hasn't really been an issue (i.e. never fired for disciplined). I do find myself getting bored, though. Regardless, don't let you BP deter you from doing something you love. I've had good luck with being open about my illness at work, which has made the bad times much easier to deal with since my supervisors knew it wasn't "me". If you made it through a master's program, then you can handle a job =] Also, talk to your therapist (if you don't have one, I highly recommend seeking one). [info] None [info] 1558310342
gotstonoe [info] i say take the risk but ultimately it comes down to what your mental illness is like. If you think you can manage it or will be able to see a therapist while in uni then by all means go for it. Also uni is where a lot of people get mental illnesses since it is at about the age where they show up and the stress of uni can push the stress-diathesis. I would suggest if you do go don't overwork yourself, eat healthy, exercise, and create a solid support system while there. Don't be afraid of seeking help from profs, friends, and in some cases family. I was diagnosed with bipolar II this past year and i'm still in uni and working my ass off. I've learned as much as i can about it and seek therapy. It can get in the way at times tbh. It's hard but i've grown and learned so much these past couple of years that i don't regret coming. I'm glad i have my support system and i help them out when possible.I hope this helps [info] None [info] 1439580735

FieryGhosts [info] Link between bipolar disorder and IBS? I was diagnosed with bipolar bipolar 5 years ago (but had 4 years of other mental health diagnoses before they decided it was actually bipolar). Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with IBS and put on the FODMAP diet. It’s turned my life around. People had always told me that my IBS symptoms (like periodically not eating) were bipolar symptoms.This new diet has improved not only my IBS symptoms, but also my bipolar symptoms and resolved the first thing I went to the doctor with 9 years ago.I’ve done some research and they’re starting to find a link between bipolar disorder and IBS. Has anyone else here been diagnosed with IBS or tried the FODMAP diet? Has it helped or no?Would anyone here be interested in trying the diet to see if it helps their bipolar symptoms?How many people here feel as if doctors completely dismiss their physical symptoms. Just because they’ve been diagnosed as bipolar.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223878/https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/probiotics-for-bipolar-disorder-mania-2018062514125 [info] None [info] 1563069770

The same cannot be easily said for the repeated scarring and open wounds from years of untreated bipolar.I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD roughly 15 years after they first emerged. The bipolar is treated. An enterprising pdoc decided to go after the OCD with high-dose Zoloft. The OCD is only now being treated, more than 20 years after onset. I have endured horrors due to both illnesses. I have lost a great deal. I would not wish this on you. [info] None [info] 1493197948
LaneyyCakes [info] Hey guys, so I've been dating my boyfriend now for 8 months. He's 22 and I'm 19. We met in college and had the time of our lives together. We're absolutely head over heels for each other and are talking about getting married. The problem is, he graduated last spring and moved to Indiana for grad school while I'm still taking classes in Delaware. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the spring of last year and shortly after, tried to commit suicide. Since then I've been living at home with my parents and taking part time classes at the University. I absolutely hate living at home and I feel like it's making me feel so much worse about myself. Me and my boyfriend decided to give it a trial run and I went to visit for a week in August. I had the time of my life and he hadnt seen me that happy since we lived together in Delaware. While I was there I decided to stay an extra three days. I called my mom and she proceeded to tell me that I was ruining her summer and that she's disappointed in me. Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend have decided on moving in together on the 26 of December. I have no doubts this is the right move but the only thing that worries me is telling me parents. Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm absolutely horrified to bring this up.  [info] None [info] 1537416821
myotherguy [info] I’m sorry you’re having this experience, as I’m sure it’s fairly disconcerting. It also does sound pretty fascinating, though. Upon first reading, I thought these sounded like petit mal seizures, but I’m not a doctor and I don’t have epilepsy myself.I used to have a similar experience pretty regularly, albeit a bit different, so maybe I can help a little? Idk. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar II, often late at night while I was getting ready for bed, I would have some phrase from a song lyric or a line from the Mass that would get stuck in my head. I would start repeating the line to myself over and over again, and it would produce that “tip of the tongue” sensation that you describe— I would feel like I was just on the edge of having a break through and that phrase or memory was somehow the key to unlocking another memory or some secret that would help me understand something intensely profound. It would be this overwhelming sense of foreboding, but like, a *positive* foreboding, if that makes any sense. After I was diagnosed with bipolar and started taking medication, these episodes stopped. This was before I had ever smoked weed, though, so it was unrelated to that. I’m sorry if that’s not much help. TL;DR: used to have similar experiences when I was unmedicated bipolar. Went on medication and they stopped. Not weed related for me.  [info] None [info] 1514307383

timmyg293 [info] Sometimes it feels like there is no way that I can win I love to self-destruct. I have cycled through the drugs, been to the therapists and seen the professionals and nothing seems to work for me. I have been diagnosed with bipolar I, meaning I go through intense mood swings that are completely random. The only thing that I have found to help me is self-destructing. This includes, but is not limited to, drugs, alcohol, cutting, the like. A couple weeks ago, I decided to commit the ultimate self-destruct. I tried to kill myself. What a lot of people don't understand about people who try to commit suicide is that it is rarely a first-time thought. I have thought about suicide since I was a young kid. For some reason, I have always been attracted to the idea. I don't know why. A couple weeks ago, almost everything came crumbling down around me.  I found out that almost everything I did in college was incorrect, my parents were incredibly disappointed, my best friends were together a state away and did not invite me, and my fiancee was leaving for Denmark for the semester the following week. I could not handle it so I decided to try to end it. Just end it all and take the easy way out. Not that it was an easy decision. I took so many pills that they had to force feed me charcoal in the hospital. I am told that my fiancee was there the entire time, holding my hand and telling me that everything was going to be okay. That is what really hurts me. That there was nothing that I could do to make her feel better. That I was always going to have to live with the fact that I tried to kill myself and that she would always know that I was too weak to handle this world. Once the ordeal was over, things have become slightly better. I still continue to contemplate suicide, and still self-destruct sometimes, but it is great to know that there are people that truly care about me. [info] None [info] 1393298779

ImBoredAndILikeGore [info] Am I a psychopath? An honest and serious inquiry. TRIGGER WARNING; if you are an empath, this may not be for you. I’m here to ask in the comfort of anonymity — without having to go and burn money on rehab, when seeking professional help.So I’ll just give you a rundown on a few major parts of me that made me wonder.- I have visited psychiatrists, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I’m 24/female, and I’ve read that female psychopaths often get misdiagnosed — so I’m like... WTF?).- Usually when I visit a psychiatrist, I am not interested in talking with them. I just want them to give me the medicines that will help calm me down.- When I was a kid, I USED TO kill smaller animals (when I was 3y/o). I would feed kittens to dogs, throw kittens on the roof, and throw kittens onto barbed wire. I also had a friend that did this, and I felt like there was a competition. I wanted to find cooler ways to kill these kittens.- Growing up, I would never maintain the average circle of friends. I always figured these people around me could come and go, and I would be fine. I could always find other people that were more convenient for me.- Recently, I like watching videos of baby monkeys being emotionally and physically tortured.- I am socially awkward (I don’t realize the need for excessive talk), but I am perfectly fine with meeting with people for something that would be beneficial for me.- I only have one recollection of ever feeling guilt, and that is when my hamster died. I felt like I could have given him a better life. Besides that, I don’t feel guilty for anything I have ever done.- I am not a dangerous person and have not done anything seriously bad because I understand there is a law and I don’t want to deal with the consequences of breaking said law. This is basically the gist of my issues. I have checked the psychopathic disorder symptoms and a lot of the things check out for me.There is one major difference though, I would never lie. I’m very honest, and will deliver bad news to you in a nice way. Thanks for reading this.

SartesLazyEye [info] Hello! I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and ADHD. This is actually a rather tricky situation, a huge side effect of attention stimulants is that they can cause irritability, mood swings, and excitability--which are all bipolar symptoms. However, if your mood symptoms are properly stabilized with a mood stabilizer, then you shouldnt be susceptible to those side effects. I personally am on lamictal, hydroxizine, and abilify. And adding adderal literally changed my life for the better. However, one thing i did experience was when i started i became a little hypomanic, then slightly emotionless following that peroid. However, now all that stabilized and i just get high attention and productivity, with our any impact on my mood [info] None [info] 1573432723

brockfuture [info] I'm a 15M newly diagnosed... and scared out of my mind About a month ago I decided that I wasn't going to sit on my mental health problems any longer, and after creating this reddit account to anonymously get some advice on my situation, I finally spoke to my school counselor and now a psychiatrist. To be honest, I didn't even know if there was anything wrong with me, but I just knew that I was sad and therapy would probably help. After seeing my psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and prescribed lithium and valproate in an attempt to stabilize my mood. I was totally not expecting this, considering I had no idea what being bipolar even meant. I'm glad I'm diagnosed, but I'm scared. I don't know if the meds will make me numb, make me better, or make me worse. I'm also scared what my family and friends will think of my when they inevitably find out. This is all so new, and I know that this "scared" stage will probably pass, but right now these fears are circling through my head. I'm glad I found this sub and although I know that we all have different experiences with being bipolar, I just wanted to see if you all have any tips for me, especially those of you who were diagnosed as children or teens.

neuroticweasel [info] AS a kid, I suffered quite a bit from mental illness. A lot of messed up stuff happened, and it generally affected my entire family. As the oldest child, I was pretty out of control, and had several behavioral problems. I ended up being hospitalized at a children's hospital.Going back to what I realized now, my family is closer because of how we had to deal with me, we can see the same patterns in my siblings. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. My brother also had bipolar, but it helped that I went through it first.Back to the matter at hand with you, talk to your parents, as they are the ones who can get you the help you need. If you can't do that right away there are hotlines out there for you to call if you need anonymous help, even if you are a minor. If you are in the States, Crisis Hotline should be able to help you quite a bit. EDIT: Read your post to my wife, she recommended if you talk to your parents, they can reach out to the local Children &amp; Youth agency for help with aid, financial services, and counselling programs.TL;DR if you need help gathering courage to talk to your parents, anonymous hotlines will help, even if you are a minor.

SoButtscrewed [info] I went through something similar, OP! I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I was diagnosed with bipolar in the Air Force about a year in and had attempted suicide. My actions also led to a stripe being removed (which I never think is the right thing to do with someone diagnosed with mental illness). I personally faced my leadership not being as understanding (my commander even said he didn't think I was mentally ill!). I think it's great you wrote this because it's important for people to understand what mental illness is like and that it's not a state of mind that goes away by smiling or watching sponge bob and pretending everything is hunky dory. In most cases it sticks with you for life. I've been out of the Air Force for about 6 months and the outside world will do you so much better. I'm off my medication, I've lost 30 pounds (gained 100 in the military), and I have a job where I feel appreciated and needed, and have time to spend on myself.

nattywow [info] I've never spoken of my sexual assault until now I'd like to share my story. This is very difficult for me to write, but even harder to speak of. I've never done either. I refer to the night I was sexually assaulted. At the time, I was 19 years old and a sophomore in college. I often think of that dark night, wishing they had killed me. I lost my life that night. No, it wasn't a physical death, rather the life within me. Imagine taking a glass cup from your cabinet, throwing it to the ground with all your might, and watching thousands of shards burst beneath you. If I can explain what my heart is like today, it would be those glass shards. Good luck putting them back together.Here is what I know: I was raped by two guys who attended my university. Since they had done it in my own bed, I'm sure one of them knew me. They held me down so aggressively, breaking my right hip. They urinated on me and left. The only thing I can remember, the ONLY thing I can remember, was my ear-splitting scream and the hands over my mouth, muzzling me. There were two sets of hands, one pair over my mouth and the other holding my legs. I remember the morning after more clearly. I was naked, shivering and the smell of urine punctured my senses. I slid off the bed to shower, in shock, but I immediately fell down from the pain in my right hip.The university police did less than nothing. I remember the face of the two policemen clearly. Their questions were skeptical and their eyes were apathetic.My life was taken from me that night. In its place remains the darkness and the screams. The harrowing screams live within me, next to me, behind me, everywhere.I have decided to write this due to the current debate regarding the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. When I heard Dr. Ford testifying in front of the senate judiciary committee, familiar feelings crept in. She said, “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.” I started sobbing at that moment. I knew she was telling the truth, for her words echoed within me, shaking me fiercely. In my opinion, empathy for another is to understand the full extent of their trauma. None of the senators on the judiciary committee, even the Democrats, can understand that which she went through. I hear her, I saw her, I felt her through my own eyes.This man is going to be on the supreme court. More than ever, I am reminded of the overwhelming disregard for women like me and the pain we've endured. My tears will continue to fall. I will not feel safe with that man on the highest court in the land. I'm hurt by the behavior of those that have mocked her. They have mocked all of us. It is inhumane to do so. I could have easily died and to mock that is to disregard the value of my life. They're telling me that to be raped is not something I should come forward with. I saw Dr.Ford speak her truth in front of the country. The result of her courageous act is in plain sight.Prior to that dark night, I had a 3.9 GPA, involved in extracurricular activities, and most of all, I was happy. Today, I am 23 years old with a 3.0 GPA still trying to get my Bachelor's degree. I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but most of all, I live in misery. I have managed to get rid of the terror from that night and compartmentalize negative emotions in order to live somewhat peacefully. I never told my parents, I never told anyone, and as of recently, I've only been reassured that was the right thing to do.Now that the Senate has decided to confirm his position on the supreme court, I feel that terror again.I had to get this off my chest. I had to say something somewhere, hoping someone might hear me. Not only for myself but for women (and men) that have experienced the same trauma. It doesn't only ruin the victim, but it hurts their families, friends, lovers, and anyone close to them. This confirmation is a gruesome, callous method of silencing those who were already reluctant to speak. [info] None [info] 1538757440

You're not a piece of shit for "not being able to handle the mental illness", she's a piece of shit for using her mental illness as an excuse to behave however she wants with no regard for how it affects other people.Also, sudden, unexplained accusations of cheating usual mean that the accuser is cheating.**TL;DR:** Dump this girl, she cray :P [info] 24, Boston [info] 1475954116
yeoldesarz [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago after a pretty bad manic episode. The signs were there for a long time, but most people (myself included) thought I was just depressed. Even today, I think the worst part is not knowing whether you're having a good day or you're a bit manic. I've been prescribed meds which I take most of the time, but every now and then I stop because I convince myself that I'm not bipolar. And that's when I realize that I most certainly am bipolar.

DelMaximum [info] I'm not suggesting a compete rehaul of the educational system. But more of a consideration for an individuals capacity for knowledge or activity would be beneficial I think. I could use myself as an example of where this point is coming from.As a very intelligent child, I was often bored in class. In both public and private schools I quickly learned how to skate through my classes, barely passing on the tests alone, rarely turning in homework. Rather than having a system that could rise to my needs, I began to backslide, not seeing the value in an education that could not sate my thirst. It was only when I could not get into college that I realized what I had done to my chances. There are countless variables that led to all of this. One of them is that at the age of seven or eight I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. Medication for these 'ailments' began immediately. Before I had even got well into my development I was undergoing a regiment of chemical all for the sake of helping me fit in. Today I am perfectly healthy and functional without the use of those pills. Had I been undrugged through my childhood, and placed in an environment where my mind was accepted and nurtured instead of drugged and forced to behave against it's inclination, I probably would be in a much more successful position in life. But now I'm just a very intelligent barista.  [info] None [info] 1301957493
FlamingZebra [info] It made me realize a lot about the world. But also it split my ego with my ego-less self. A lot of times I have problems coming back to reality because reality is a place where ego will push you into a place where you work and make money and are a slave to society. I want to be successful, but losing me ego has caused me to realize that life isn't about anything that society says it is. Acid can help to a certain extent, but when you become addicted to escaping reality it becomes something that pushes you away from the world itself. I find disconnect in other people. However, I am getting better. I am going to treatment and learning ways to piece my reality back together.Edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and taking acid took the different personalities in my head to a different level to the point where it's hard to know who I really am anymore. If you start feeling like acid is creating a different world for you, you should take a step back and take time to settle and understand that being able to cope and work with reality is a part of living a happy life. It is a beautiful drug don't get me wrong, but when you start getting to know people who take acid way more than they should, you start to realize how it can negatively affect someones life. It's a drug to take with caution. Every trip is a different experience, and for some people, it's hard to stop thinking they way they did when they trip. It's a powerful tool for altering the mind, but that doesn't always mean people use it in the right way. [info] None [info] 1442008774
waterproof13 [info] I think it would be a good idea to talk to your psychiatrist about it.It seems that it neither helps as much as medication could and then there's a significant side effect.Have you tried non SSRI medication? They don't work for everyone. Didn't work for me and later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The fact that you are delusional and aren't getting medication to address that is bothering me.

Ryveks [info] I never was officially diagnosed with PTSD, but I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I probably do have it, it's been thrown around by my psychologists. I watched my mom die of a cerebral hemorrhage when I was 17 and had to deal with a lot of family drama (taking care of my father and older brother). I really didn't exhibit any serious signs of being bipolar before that (though looking back, there were a few times here and there you could say I mildly was). When I was 20, I spent almost a year psychotically depressed. This, too, contributed to me being severely traumatized (including very vivid/lucid dreams of my mom trying to kill me). I'm on medications now, and I phase in and out sometimes of having milder versions of the feelings of being traumatized by losing my mom. Sometimes I can have those nice hypomanic phases, where I feel like I have so much still ahead of me, and I can take on the world. If you can't afford therapy and medications for now, and you do the diet, exercise thing, try finding someone, anyone you can open up to. Maybe your closest friend, maybe us on here. I found that it helps a lot when you remember there are people out there who care about you. I know I have a huge, huge problem opening up to my friends. I always feel like I'm a huge burden to them, raining on their parade, making them feel bad for me and helpless because there's nothing they can do for me. One of my biggest issues has been feeling like I have nothing to fall back on, no safety net. I was super close to my mom, a total homebody, and now I don't even have a place to call home. I think one of the biggest steps for me has been finding a place I feel safe. When I find those places, yeah I'll still have my depressed moments and even some hypo-manic ones, but I can handle everything better. I realized that with the added stresses, I feel more like I'm losing control of everything, making everything worse. I can control myself a lot better when I'm depressed (or so some part of me thinks) so I almost feel like I shut myself down. When there's some thing that grounds me, somewhere I can go and feel safe, my brain kind of rides the bipolar waves much more easily. I can handle the depressed bits because I know eventually I'll feel grand again and I have the energy to take what comes. [info] None [info] 1278273894
deadmessages [info] Bipolar and college I was diagnosed with bipolar II roughly 2 years ago and have been medicated ever since. I started college this past fall after about a year and a half of feeling stable. I have been taking the same medications and still attending regular appointments with a therapist,however, I still feel my mental health is not where it needs to me. There is a lot of pressure on me to do extremely well in school, from both myself and my parents. Unfortunately, due to lack of study skills and time management this didn't happen gorst semester so now I'm stuck trying ro make up for it. I would really like to get into the nursing program at my school, but since it is the top in the state it is very competitive. I am worried all this stress is the main reason for my degrading mental health. To continue to move towards nursing school this upcoming fall will be the most rigorous semester so far and I'm scared shitless I will fall apart. I have already found myself in amd out of depressive states where it is hard for me to concentrate in class and when I try to study. I am looking for some advice from anyone with a similar experience. I don't know what to do. I won't be able to really relax this summer, I am taking a class online and working two jobs to help fund my school, as well trying to begin studying for the TEAS exam. I would rather not take time off from school. I fear trying to explain everything to my parents as well, they have had trouble understanding where I come from on thing in the past because neither of them have ever struggled with mental health. They also have extremely high expectations of me, and I was not the best child growing up so I hate to continue to dissapoint them. However, the last thing I want is to end up hitting rock bottom again. There is always the option of changing my major to reduce stress, but I worry I would regret it in the future. If anyone has any tips or guidance it would be greatly appreciated. [info] None [info] 1429084390
Reubenls [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and life was still a rollercoaster whilst on lithium and effexor. Missing my medication meant some days I couldn't get out of bed or I was hypomanic - being on medication was innately still a struggle in itself. Within the past three weeks I installed f.lux a blue-blocking computer program and an almost magical shift in my life was apparent. I was able to get to bed early and wake up early, I was able to attend work, my mood was excellent, I had energy and most importantly I was able to function. I didn't even connect the dots until a few days ago and I installed f.lux without even the thought of such a benefit passing my mind. I was functioning so well I decided to come off effexor cold turkey and since coming off effexor I no longer smoke and no longer get impulsive and reckless urges like I was prior. I haven't been able to do these things in a very long time and it could be attributed it to the immense amount of time I spend on the computer being bombarded by blue-light. I still obviously am very cautious with the disorder and I continue to take my lithium but it has been quite an interesting change.tl;dr: Blue-light blocker had incredible effects on my bipolar disorder [info] None [info] 1469705331
VistaVilla_Mac [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 before BPD. I used to have major mood swings that were long lasting, but with proper medication they went away. Then BPD was apparent because I would have regular problems with emotions that didn't last very long essentially. To answer your question if you get the right medication for bipolar disorder it can be managed very well. That allows you to work on dealing with BPD through DBT or something like that.

JamalPancakes [info] In 1996... In 1996, I was 20 years old. I felt isolated, hypnotized by soap operas and clinically depressed. (7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.) But I wanted to be an actress. This time of my life is very convoluted in my mind because I was drunk a lot, doing drugs, having sex for the first time. I was performing in a theater group with people who were several years older than me and liked to party and hook up with each other. It was a lot of fun. I felt free but also constantly confused, insecure, and clueless. My friends regarded me as an innocent. Part of the group was MM, who wrote music for our shows. I was dating his 32 year old band mate (BF). A few things had happened between the 2 of them that broke up the band:~~MM apparently stole a bunch of BF’s equipment. In retaliation, BF made a webpage featuring MM’s ex-wife’s naked pictures announcing that MM stole his equipment.  The .com was the name of MM’s new band. ~~When MM started his new band, BF attempted to sabotage a contest MM’s band entered. They aborted the plan when I unexpectedly showed up at the show.  I’m not sure what BF and his cronies had planned... I think maybe egg them when they were on stage?  It was definitely to humiliate them in some way. I was shocked, drunk, naive, and had no idea how to handle the situation.  My reaction was to try and not get involved. I just knew that I liked MM’s music better than BF’s, (Haha) and I wanted to remain MM’s friend, but had no idea how.  A few months before all the bullshit, BF had me sing on a parody song of an incident that took place between MM and a girl sexin’ it up in a parking lot that went wrong.  I thought it was all in good fun. Several friends took part in it too, but I was singing, I was the featured one. I became super regretful. It was mean spirited.  So I’m sure MM believed I was a part of BF’s other schemes too. His nickname for me was “Linda”, then it became “Yoko”.  Great. I ended up becoming one of those drunk &amp; psychotic girlfriends. Rambling on about nonsense. Resentful. Angry. Inconsolable. Until BF cut off all contact with me. I needed it, but I had a major nervous breakdown requiring hospitalization. I got clean and I’ve been clean ever since. 15 years now. I had no idea what the rest of my friends knew about my situation. If I was hated, if I was forgiven?  I had cut all of them off too.  I’m sure I became “that psycho chick”, but they knew I needed to change. So 3 years ago, MM posted on Facebook a video of a musical we had done. It is excruciating to see myself in it. The regret is overwhelming.  MM friended me, we messaged very briefly, I was weird and vague. I don’t know why  He was reaching out, but I was weird.  But we were cordial. He unfriended me soon after. And I was embarrassed all over again. So today, that video must have come up on his memories notifications, and he commented.... “There’s a really nice moment near the end where it seems that the two almost kiss.” The two. THE TWO. Not “you guys”, not “you two”.  The two.  Like I’m a non-person. A non-friend.  I really feel like I’m overreacting. Is he reaching out again?  Why would he say it like that?  It was also a nice thing to say, but it definitely felt like a fuck you. I’m remembering those crazy person feelings and I understand how I would blow any unpleasant feeling I had out of proportion. Y’know how social media makes you think that everyone’s life is better?  That all of your old friends are still best friends and are hanging out without you?  How they’re able to maintain a good relationship for years and years and you’re just a failure because you don’t get the wedding invitations or get to have a lovely genuine reaction to their baby being born. I don’t always feel this way, but seeing his comment made me remember everything. I guess this is what happens when you’re 42. And a recovering addict. And have mental illness. And take responsibility for your actions but the consequences are still there.  There is no neat bow to tie it up. [info] None [info] 1537617355
Church-of-Nephalus [info] Feeling 'high/good' and 'low/bad' days? [Discussing Bipolar 1] So I was diagnosed with bipolar I a few months ago and I am getting treatment for it, but I do want to discuss something about it. My mania days, or what I call high days, involve extreme activity. I get more work done, I feel a lot better about myself, I feel like I can take on the world. The best part about it is that I get stuff done, as I have a lot of projects. My bad days, or low days, are sluggish. They make me want to stay in bed, I get very depressing and even suicidal thoughts during those days. I get existential.But is it weird that I can feel these days? For example, on a mania day, I feel lighter. I feel more active. It's like I'm in full swing, I can't stay still, I'm very excited. On a low day, I feel heavy. Everything is slow. I don't feel like getting up. My eyes are constantly down. I feel like sleeping constantly.Is it strange to 'feel' your mania or low days? [info] None [info] 1581820337

bhgiel [info] Bipolar, addiction, and shrooms Psyhcodelics have been all the buzz lately. The part that catches me the most is the possible ability to combat addiction. I have been an alcoholic for years and cannot put down weed or cigs. I really feel that a trip on shrooms might really help me out. Unfortunately I have been diagnosed with bipolar for the majority of my life. I often hear that these two dont mix well. I also always joke with my friends that I am one psychotic break away from this or that... lol. I've got a micro dose of shrooms and want to give them a go, however I am unceartin of what may happen. There is not much research on this and was curious what the university of reddit thought. [info] None [info] 1531185253
something_stoopid [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I had a nervous breakdown when my sons father and I split up. He relapsed with his drug use, created an extremely unsafe situation for our son one morning, and that was it. Our 18mth old son had access to a used needle box, and I'd gotten up just as he was about to put an alcohol swab that had been left on the floor in his mouth. My ex STILL tried to say he wasn't shooting up. This would NEVER have happened if I was around. That and the other stresses I had going on, sent me over the edge for a bit there. I got diagnosed, was medicated for a while. Moved interstate to be with my family while the ex was off on his binge. He agreed to us leaving. The he got a girlfriend who decided she wanted a kid. In fact, she wanted the kid he already had because she couldn't have kids. So I get a call from his lawyer, saying he's requesting mediation, looking at going to court for full custody. We're in Australia, not sure how it works in other countries but you have to go to court mediation before you even step foot in a courtroom. He pulled the 'she has bipolar! She's crazy!' Line. Both of our lawyers shot him down. Bipolar is not something you can help having. As long as you manage it correctly. If you're manic, and showing behaviours that are dangerous, then you get help. I am off medication now, see a therapist monthly to keep him updated Ido it for the benefit of myself and the court. My therapist is a neutral reference for me, saying the facts of my condition, if it were to be brought up. They can't make decisions based on the fact I have the condition, but if he lies about it, which is extremely likely, I have a record there. Here, you're mental condition does not affect your parenting unless you get committed. It's against the law to judge based on anything else. Anyway our mediation worked out fine. He's still not around, and broken up with the girl he was with so is over the whole full time dad idea again. It didn't end up in court because the only 'ammo' so to speak, that he had was my bipolar diagnosis. He thought the point was to go in there and insult me, not try and work something out for our son. Ask your lawyer. But from what I can tell it should be fairly similar in the us/uk. See a doctor, keep it managed, and even if its not like it is here, you will have a reference saying you've got it under control. [info] None [info] 1373323793

nerdy_birdie10 [info] I'm 21, so not too far from the cut off age. I always loved my parents, but we butted heads a lot when I was in high school. They were always very communicative with me and so I knew about our financial troubles and all my mom's problems (deeply depressed and semi-addicted to prescription meds.) There were never any really serious problems between us or anything, but I was definitely ready to get out of there when I went to college.Then when I was 20 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my life was thrown into a tailspin. It took me a while to get my meds stright and feel balanced so for about a year and a half I was struggling in school, engaging in high risk behavior and was occasionally a suicide risk. My life was a shitshow, basically. And they took care of me in a way only parents can. They took the verbal abuse I hurled at them when they tried to stop me from doing dangerous things. They stayed up late with me when I couldn't stop crying. They were amazing. Looking back at that time and my life in general I could not be more thankful to have them.I always went to my dad for boy problems and he was so patient with me listening to the stupid teenage stuff we all go through. He and my mom both worked multiple jobs that were below them (they are both incredibly smart) just so they could provide for us and make sure we had what we wanted. I am overwhelmed by how much they love me, and I am so glad they took the time to make sure I became a kind a well rounded person. Now thankfully things have turned around for me and I'm back in school and doing well. I talk to them often and let them know I appreciate them. I know a lot of people suffer with awful parents and I  am glad I realized just how lucky I am to have them.....I'm going to go call them now. [info] None [info] 1381169790
EtherealBipolar [info] It’s my 23rd birthday in 20 minutes and I feel like I should have died last April So, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with rapid cycling in June last year after trying to kill myself in spectacular fashion between April and then. I still feel no closer to anything and can practically feel myself getting worse. All I can think is that I regret failing, and I wish I’d never made it to this birthday. I hate my birthday as it has REALLY bad memories for me attached to it and family keeps saying happy birthday because none of them know and it just makes it worse. I didn’t want to do this again and I feel like healthcare and those around me are dragging me to it. My best friend decided that it was best that I failed my 4 (and counting) attempts as he can still spend time with me, completely ignoring the fact that I find mere existence painful. Not just bipolar either, I have a trapped nerve in my spine, so constant burning pain in my arm. I just feel like everything is always getting worse and I can’t tell anyone. I didn’t ever want to get this far but I feel like my choice has been taken away. [info] None [info] 1553470801
JD515515 [info] &amp;#x200B;I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have also been hypo manic in the past few months because I went off my medication. The best thing you can do for yourself is to take your mental health into your own hands. I started cleaning up my life slowly. This started with me identifying my behaviors that were not healthy for me. 1. Do you have healthy people in your life? How do you feel when you're around these people? If you feel bad when you're hanging out with them. Perhaps they should not be in your life.2. Do you exercise regularly?  You don't have to attend a gym, but literally 30 minutes of exercise a day will help you feel a lot better.3. Drink water regularly4. Eat fruits and vegetables. It seriously helps. 5. Are you on any medication? I know western medicine is not for everyone, but it can help tremendously once you find the right medication. 6. If you want to go on medication, go to your GP and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist. 7. Find a hobby. This can be a great thing to do because it provides motivation when you're depressed and it's an outlet for when you're manic.8. Journal or try cognitive behavioral therapy. Go to [www.moodgym.com](https://www.moodgym.com). It costs $40/annually but it's a very helpful resource to help combat negative thinking. 9. Practice gratitude and self-love. Take care of yourself and love yourself. In any way that you can. Take baths, watch your favorite shows, talk to a friend, journal. Do what makes you happy.10. Do you like your job in the first place? If not, perhaps it's time for a change of occupation!Take care of yourself. It's cliche to say but even the fact that you posted on this subreddit is a step in the right direction. You are not responsible for your mental illness. It's not you fault that it happened. Take everything one day at a time and I promise you it will get better &lt;3 [info] None [info] 1559101951

Mittinmang [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional psychiatrists in a clinic. I've made my peace with it, or at least I try to cope with it and try to keep my balanced without medication. I just wish my family, especially my mom would understand that I'm trying my hardest but sometimes I'm just depressed and sometimes I do crazy stuff out of nowhere without caring about the consequences. Her constant judgement makes it hard to fight against my own brain because I feel like it's my fault, I'm doing it KNOWING I shouldn't, which isn't true.But to be positive: In my manic episodes I'm doing crazy stuff, and yeah, I'm in debt. But it's an adventure and it sometimes actually helps me doing things that I always wanted to do; Just like moving 600km away from home for my first love.

wheelchairassassins [info] I love my story. I was in a manic phase, it was a long one with a lot of promiscuity and thievery and compulsions. He found me on MySpace and after a month of talking, invited me to his house for a movie. He had a cold, so I brought a can of soup and didn't even heat it up. Let's face it, I was planning on getting laid and that would probably be that. I ended up spending the night, and we watched Star Trek: Wrath of Khan (first brush with real sci fi I had ever had) and then the next day I watched him play video games all day. The next weekend we spent together and Sunday night, after I went home, he checked himself into a hospital for hallucinations, visual and auditory. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and I felt like just bailing on him because he had a diagnosis of some kind. (This was before I was diagnosed with anything, I just thought I was generally fucked up.) In the ensuing months, he was kicked out of his house, had to move in with his terrible birth parents who he didn't have any contact with at the time, off and on all kinds of anti psychotics...it was a really hectic year and I didn't know what I was doing. I just knew that a) I was emotionally dependent and desperate for someone to love me and b) I really liked this guy a lot! He went on disability, things settled and we're now 11 years on. Since then, I've been diagnosed with bipolar, gone through ridiculous med changes and have also gone on disability, so now we live the life of two 30-something octogenarians. It's my favorite love story. [info] None [info] 1477612734
_exobot [info] My new medication change is making things hard. I just got on Ritalin for the first time since I was little. Today is only the second day, but I already feel like it's ruining everything. I've been stable and feeling good for a long time. I've been on the same prescriptions for at least two years. I had been feeling good about myself, healthy, stable in my moods, and reasonably happy. But now I feel awful. My self-esteem is in the toilet. I'm moody, I'm sensitive, and I feel like crying throughout the day. I know I've made a lot of progress over the years, and my psychiatrist of 11+ years says I'm the most responsible mentally ill young person he's ever treated. I take all my medication every day at the same time (I even have a watch set). I've worked so hard. So, so hard just to try to be functional and I know this may be wrongheaded, but I've fought to come off as normal as well. If you met me, you would probably never suspect that I'm disabled. I've done so much to try to live a normal life. I take care of my teeth, my hygeine, my own bills, my social responsibilities. I'm unemployed right now, but it's so I can take care of my dad, who had a heart attack two years ago and is in a wheelchair, but I had a job for over half a year where I fit in with no one the wiser. And it was a HARD job. Average day was 11 hours and I once worked a 19-hour day. And I was the one who left. But now I feel like I just have nothing. I feel like I don't have friends, even though I do, and I feel like I haven't made any progress, even though I have. I've been here before. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder, GAD, panic disorder with agoraphobia, ADD, hypothyroidism, and I've got sleep apnea on top of it. I usually don't dwell on it, but I'm back to feeling like I got fucked sideways by genetics. I'm on so many pills I can't even remember how many I take each day most of the time. I think it's two Lamictal, three Klonopin, one Lithium, one and a half Liothyronine, one Levothyroxine, one Pristiq, and now one Ritalin. My attention span is improving, but I just feel so ruined. Like I'm falling apart. I'm being pushed to my limits for the millionth time. I'll never give up, ever. Life is too precious. But I'm just hitting bottom. I've felt for years that the only way to rehabilitate is to do it all yourself, so I'm not used to reaching out for help, but I just feel so helpless and awful. I don't know what to do. I don't even fully know why I'm here. I guess I just need to reach out. Can someone help me? This is terrible. I'm so sick. [info] None [info] 1453488015
FriendlyAM [info] How can I help my wife to cope with my disorder? Hello  partners in adversity. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type II in February 2013 (hard to believe it's been 7 years almost to date...). Before my diagnosis my condition and behavior drove away an ex-girlfriend I'd been together with for 4 years. A month after my diagnosis I met the woman who is now my wife. I was working as a nurse at a psychiatric ward (oh, irony) and she was a therapist. I came clean with her before we even officially started a relationship because hiding a large part of who I am and why I am the way I am seemed dishonest to her.Anyway, we'll be married for 5 years in June and we have a two-year old son who is the apple of my eye. Although he's a very calm and pleasant little boy, it's stressing for me. He's been sleeping through the night since he was 6 weeks old, but that also means the day starts at 06.30 AM for me every day. For the past 2 years and 4 months. Combined with work stress, I haven't been myself for the past year and a half, but I've been the Bipolar. I've always leaned heavily towards the depressive pole, with only a few hypomanic episodes in the beginning of this journey.To cut to the chase, it's starting to become difficult for my wife. She's got 14 years worth of experience dealing with people with mental health issues, but this is different. I should be there for her and our son 100% of the time. In reality I get annoyed really easily and fail to do my utmost for my family. Forgetting chores, bills, not preparing food etc.Since about a year she's becoming colder when she's angry. She loses patience with my fuck-ups and yells at me. I've talked about this with my psychiatrist, but it isn't much help.I'm not asking for advice on how to get better. I'm resigned to the fact that I'll carry this on my shoulders for the rest of my life. I just wonder if there's any way I can make it easier to bear for my wife.

Void_pup [info] “You don’t have that genetic mental illness” My NMom has always made things about her- no matter what happens to the members of our family, she wants to be in the spotlight more than she wants to support.In March 2017 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder- which is late-onset (I’m 23 now) and genetic. I confide in my parents as this is the hardest thing- or at least how it affected my job- that I have had to endure, and I was living out of state away from family anyway. They seemed pretty supportive over text... but then I went to visit them. While I was with them for 2 weeks, my illness was brought up because of circumstances, and my NMom had the gall to tell me that, despite the clinical diagnosis, do not have bipolar disorder. I also heard this from my parents’ friends when they filled them in. I, and adult who has lived away from family for 3 years, was obviously mistaken about my mental health... /sAnyway, after my visit I returned to my own home states away from them and get a text a couple days later. From my dad: “Your mother has appointment April 9th because she has (insert my symptoms here)”. Keep in mind, now, that bipolar disorder is late-onset in that it will show up around 16-25 years old (most commonly) and is not later developed at 47 years old weeks after your daughter finds out she has it. Weeks pass and she has her appointment. She talks to a doctor and gets diagnosed with Adult ADHD. She says it makes sense of her growing up and how her personality is, which should be supported, sure. But wait, she needs to find resources like support groups and doesn’t know if she can take Adderall daily. She tells me how hard it is to work with her condition, and she’s taking time off to “figure some stuff out”. About a month later she starts texting me to talk to my doctor about my diagnosis. Because surely, I have Adult ADHD and not bipolar disorder. Because I’ve “never shown signs” when I was growing up, and that if she has it then I do too. This was easy to ignore the first few times it was brought up. I told my psychologist, moved on, whatever. Now I’m living with my parents again, after losing my job in another state (because illness, mind you). It’s harder to ignore now, as my mother and I drove 1500 miles to get me back to my hometown, I was berated about how the doctors and medications I had were not going to do anything for me. Because HER diagnosis makes more sense than MINE (in her eyes, not in actuality).And it’s something I’m still annoyingly dealing with. She wants me to see her doctors and get the “right diagnosis”. As if my own plights and difficulties I’ve endured over the last 5 years as my mental health has suffered all mean nothing.  Because, obviously, I’m not as sick as I think I am.

mimishi [info] [18F] I've lost 22 pounds in two months but why? 18F and Asian, I've been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, panic disorder and ADHD. I've recently made a switch on my medication from taking prozac (15mg) and  risperidone(1.5mg) to just taking vraylar (1.5mg). I'm currently not in a depressive episode neither a hypomanic episode I've been stable for about 5 months. Recently I've been having constant chest pain, head aches, a constant feeling of hunger although I do eat, thirst/dehydration although all I drink is water, my body is very fatigued and I feel shaky (maybe it's due to my ADHD medication, methylphenidate (18mg) but it shouldn't be as I've taken this for years). I was about 138 two months ago but currently I weigh 116, could it be weight loss due to the switch of my medication or could it be something more serious? I do not drink, smoke or do drugs.

Esosorum [info] Yeah, it all seems normal. It just seems to happen to me more often and a little more dramatically than to anyone else I've told about it.

noFunnyLoginsLeft [info] Depends on person's characteristic. Of course, as long as you two aren't in a erotic or romantic relationship, she doesn't really expect you to be her steady rock, while she's the storm.But, there are women (or actually just people) who might use your weakness against you. Or even simply despise you for being weak. As long as it's working for you, keep doing what you're doing. But this NEVER EVER allows you let go of control of yourself and your life.Myself, I'm seeing a female psychiatrist. First interview ended after 20 minutes and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was prescribed pills that efectively turned me into a potato. I quit taking them after two weeks. I reevaluated everything in my life, questioned close friends and family. Never found any significant symptoms of BPD and voiced my doubts to my psychiatrist. She confirmed I have BPD, prescriped me new pills and sent me home.Although it might just be that she wanted to send me home ASAP, it's not like I'M paying for the treatment or help, the government is paying for me just coming there.

Explolguy [info] First, I'd like to thank you for replying.I understand very much where he's coming from. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago after a suicide attempt. I spent a lot of time in a very bad place, and got out because I realized I needed help and let people help. A lot of my suggestions at doing certain activities come with the offer of doing them with me. We play games, we go out and do random whatever now and again. There are also days where he needs to vent, and I listen. But he asks for advice, and I give it, and he simply shrugs it off, saying he, "Can't do it and will never change," among other things.I am one person, and obviously not qualified to give suggestions, opinions, a diagnosis etc. that professionals are qualified to give. He acknowledges that he needs help, but doesn't want to make the jump to get it. I've been going around for months with him. And as ashamed as I am to admit this, I'm ready to throw in the towel. He has a bunch of people ready to help him at a moment's notice, and it's getting frustrating  [info] None [info] 1389269022
IEatYourFruitLoops [info] Hitting rock bottom, not sure where to go In a therapy session this past week I realized that I'm depressed. I was diagnosed with bipolar ii a few years ago, but I've been mildly medicated since then, so it never occurred to me that it might still be a thing.About 2 years ago I was in the middle of a serious weight loss attempt that left me 50lbs down and feeling good. Then I started a new job that provided free unlimited snacks (Cheetos, Cheez-its, etc) and I gained 15 lbs back. I haven't stepped on a scale since then but based on my current back pain, I'm probably another 10+lbs up.So I'm depressed and overweight and constantly in pain and I'm feeling helpless. My boyfriend has been amazing, but he deserves so much more than what I am able to give him. Every time I think about sex I feel embarrassed and gross. I look down at my naked body and think "ew".I don't know what I'm looking to accomplish with this post, but I'm constantly stressed and grumpy and feeling desperate, so I guess I figure, what's the worst that could happen. I'm already at the lowest low that I've seen since my sister died, so how bad can it get.I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I have to reschedule it for work. I hate picking up the phone, and my workload makes for a convenient excuse. Everything is hard. Getting up is hard. Making an important phone call is hard. I love my job, but going to work is hard. Every day I want to cry, but I'm an adult and there is no crying in baseball.I keep telling myself that I need to keep going for my boyfriend and my family. My family has already lost one sister/daughter, it wouldn't be fair if they lost another. And my boyfriend has been nothing but wonderful, and he doesn't deserve anything like that (not that anyone does, but him especially not).The people I love are the only ones sustaining me these days, but I'm not sure how long that's going to last. I need to find a solution soon. [info] None [info] 1481515678

madchampagne [info] New here. Feeling stupid for these questions. So today I was diagnosed with bipolar. And I have so many questions, maybe someone could help me and answer it. First of all do I really need to take medicines? My psychiatrist said yes, it's necessary, but is it really? Or there is another way? And during the treatment will I ever find out what I really want to do in my life? Now on my mania phase I have so many hobbies, activities but can't stick to them and I actually don't know what I want to do and how to force myself to do all things I have planned. So when you are on your treatment do you feel less messed up and can you decide who you really want to be?P.S. so so sorry for my gramma, English is not my native language [info] None [info] 1577817549
HarryTheGreyhound [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about eighteen years ago.  It is hard, but lithium/lamotrigine are effective and the side-effects are manageable.  There is absolutely no shame in having an illness like this, nor in getting help. If you're smart enough to see someone, you'll also be able to recognise early warning signs of mood changes or triggers, and to deploy mitigation strategies against this.I really hope you do well and that you successfully deal with this.

bunkiescat [info] I’m crumbling I can’t feel happy anymore. I don’t know how to change it. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it’s really been taking me over. Everyone keeps asking what’s wrong and I don’t even know what wrong. The thing I hate is that everyone can see that I’m different and I can feel it every time I wake up. I can’t even be around anyone without feeling upset or angry, when I’m alone I can feel it even more. I’ll get high and drunk to try to fix it and I’ll feel happy for about 3 seconds when I’m laughing in the moment til I realize how I actually feel. I just wish people could accept I’m not happy right now and I can’t change it when I really wish I could. Nothing makes me feel better anymore. I’m trying really hard to not go buy Xanax to numb this pain or put a blade to my skin and tear myself to feel something besides what’s inside my head. But until then I’ll wipe my tears and smile so no one is worried about me because I’m fine. At least that’s what they can think. I’m so toxic. I don’t wanted anyone to say drugs and alcohol doesn’t fix anything , I know that. No I’m not on medication and I know self medication isn’t good. But when it’s the only thing keeping you from doing the things I think about to myself you would do it too. [info] None [info] 1587606759
dd2615 [info] Just found out I have BPD...Trying to fix broken relationship For years I have wondered why no medications will work for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (not otherwise specified) at 15. My moods have never been up and down(classic) but its possible that I might be on the hypomanic side. Heres the thing, every relationship is the same. I meet a guy, things are great in the beginning as soon as he gets close I either get completley emotionally numb or I start to self sabatosh the relationship and push him away. I have been doing this since I started dating as a teenager and fast forward to now, at 25, I am a single mom with a 2 year old son. 5 months ago I met an incredible man, attractive, sweet, great with my son, the whole 9...throughout the course of us dating I tried to break up with him 3 times...The last time I did he became distant to the point where I thought he was cheating on me. So I broke up with him because I thought I couldnt trust him. Of course that whole time knowing that I still wanted to be with him and had no proof whatsoever of him cheating. All the while hes still watching my son. But there would be like week stretches where we wouldnt talk it and freaked me out. He also has an 8 year old son. he is 34...We talked distantly off and on after I broke up with him the last time for about 2 to 3 weeks..But about two weeks ago I snapped...Thinking he had been cheating on me I contacted a girl on his Facebook page that I thought he was seeing...Turns out he had no idea who that girl was...It was really embarassing..I ended up admitting to him that I had done that...He was obviously irritated by it but still willing to talk to me...Well doing the classic borderline thing I was feeling like I was pretty much doomed with him so I started pushing him away again, being clingy on purpose (on PURPOSE), dissecting our "friendship" which is really just code for open relationship, and I could tell by the tone in his voice the last time I talked to him that he was done. So I texted him and apologized, told him that I had been childish lately and if he wanted to talk to me he could but i was going to back off..But its a cycle...because hell come back and ill try to push him away again...Or maybe he wont come back and then Ill blame myself...But I just wanted to know what everyone thinks and if anyone has experienced this before...Please try to be nice...In a pretty vulnerable spot right now..

mygodshessohot [info] A little help? I feel like I'm watching my life take place, without ne making the choices, like it's on autopilot. its been this way my whole life. allow me to explainI've always been amazing at improvisation. I think fast on my feet, and never have any trouble coming up with ideas. It's to the point, in fact, where sometimes I dont know what I'm even going to say when I start talking. It's just these words come out and I had little input in their construction. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and adhd, but for a number of reasons I think these are misdiagnoses. (I'll get to that later)The me inside my head is a completely different person than the person who chooses what I say. my mind is always racing, hyperanalyzing every situation. My inner self is cold, rational, and cares for nobody, not even myself.prime examples of both emotional response when I should have one1. I was raped as a child, it never was remotely traumatic whatsoever2. Family and friends die, I feel nothing, besides a slight "oh well" at the fact that I wont see them again3. It was possible I had cancer. Didnt care. didnt end up having it but stillAs for my diagnosed illnesses, I simply dont think they are plausible. Certainly not bipolar (I simply don't feel, and haven't as long as I can remember).ADHD has a little more plausibility, as ky sctiond are almost always an impulse, like I said, but inside of my mind I am very calculating.It's a little misleading when I say I can't feel. I can feel brief glimpses of euphoria and rage. As a result, I attempt to induce these states often. I have been told I have major anger problems my whole life, and have infrequent anger outbursts. As for euphoria, I seek thrills and hang out with friends to satisfy that need.I have never felt sadness, though, nor have I felt guilt or remorse. Its sickening and empty. Sadness is also the only emotion my autopilot cannot fake, so I have to do that consciously (with varying results  )thanks for listening, also is there a name for this? [info] None [info] 1581057376
Lequids [info] Am I becoming immune to my medicine? Hello all,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a year ago, and I’ve been on Lithium for a solid 4 months straight now. It worked really well in the beginning. My moods were stable and controllable, my sleeping schedule was on track, and for the first time in a while I finally had some mental clarity. But the past month or so, I’ve noticed the effects have been deteriorating. It started with my sleeping schedule. Instead of getting a normal 6-8 hours every night, I went back to my usual routine of not sleeping more than 3 hours a night for 2-3 days and then crashing for 12+ hours. After that, I noticed that I was getting more irritable than usual. I chalked both of these up to personal stresses and ignored it. But the last 36 hours have been really weird. I didn’t sleep at all last night, and when I finally managed to take a short nap, I woke up feeling very depressed for seemingly no reason at all. I’ve been very adamant on taking my pills, I think I’ve only missed it 3 or 4 times in the last 4 months, and none of those times were within the last month. Anyone else experience anything like this? [info] None [info] 1546812539
weirdpancake [info] I used to be a night owl, before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  Mania made me not sleep. Depression made me not sleep. Crazy stuff. Now, I'm a morning person. I wake up at 5:45, go running for about 40 min with my dog, drink some coffee, eat some cereal, pet the dog for half an hour on the couch, then head off to work. Don't forget to throw a shower in there.In order to be a morning person, I have to have everything set and ready for myself in the morning. Running clothes and shoes set out. Headphones and music ready. Coffee on a timer to be ready when I get home from my run. I need all this so I don't 'overthink' my morning and become overwhelmed and give up on getting up and moving. "Don't think. Just move" is my morning motto. Also, I go to bed at like 10pm. On the weekends I kinda have to be a morning person. My meds are on a schedule, and I have to take them at about 7am every morning with food or else I'll start hallucinating if I'm late on taking them. Sometimes I go back to bed on the weekend afterward, but most of those mornings are spent pretending to sleep while petting the dog and being all snuggly in the blankets.Sorry for the huge paragraph. :P [info] http://www.wlsearch.com/u/weirdpancake [info] 1497650456

IcarianSkies [info] My daily emotional state was just empty sadness. I thought a lot about killing myself, I planned to off myself before 25, no point in living through adulthood. I self-harmed. I slept all day and found very little joy in anything. I was prone to fits of violent rage, and periods of random crying. But there were random periods of time where everything was sunshine and rainbows and I had to do all the things. Omg my room is dirty clean the room ahh somebody left dishes in the sink wash the dishes I don't like the furniture arrangement rearrange the living room. A million miles an hour. I'd sleep 3 hours a night versus my normal depressed 14 hours. And then I'd just crash and go right back to the empty sadness. It took me a while to realise it, but I did eventually come to the conclusion that this mania was nowhere near normal, and I'd grown up seeing it in my mother and recognised the symptoms.

hellinhigheels [info] Mania or mixed state? It's been a few years since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I'm still trying to learn to point out exactly what it's happening to me.On Sunday I was very irritated and had a massive fight with my family, then because of the fight I got incredibly angry and frustrated and cried for hours and even had a panic attack. On Monday, during the day, everything was okay, beautiful even. Then my mom got home from work and we had another fight and there I was again crying and nearly having a panic attack, eventually my mom said she was sorry and I went back to being incredibly okay. Since then I've been sleeping 5 hours a day, talking too fast, racing thoughts, bouncing legs, etc, nearly everything you read about mania, but not that distructible because over the years I learned pretty well how to spot my episodes.The thing is that what happened Sunday doesn't come near of what a mixed state feels like. Mixed states are the worse thing on earth and there I was only mad and frustrated, but I don't exactly know what to think about it.Recently I've been paying more attention to my mood fluctuations and I think it's my first time knowing I'm at least a little bit manic, so I really have no idea how worse it is because I'm able to control the symptoms [info] None [info] 1351215969
MezzGFX [info] Story time. (I was probably considered the weird one after.. but bare with me)When I was younger I was diagnosed with bipolar. The doctor didn't believe in diagnosing younger kids with bipolar at the time, however he eventually did it after no other option. I attacked my mother, I would tell her I was gonna kill myself, I had trouble in school, I skipped school at a young age, I was a mess &amp; put my mother through a long and tough time for years. I never meant any of the actions I did. I was never going to kill myself. I regret all of it. And unfortunately, all of my actions were due out of anger. I couldn't control it. And every medication I was on only made it 10x worse.Eventually, the doctor had no other option but to send me to a special "home" with other kids that had problems. I was there for 2 weeks. And it was the longest 2 weeks of my life. To me, and other kids.. it felt like Jail.Before I tell you about it, you have to understand. My mother knew it wasn't the place for me. She loved me and knew all my actions were from my anger and not "me". But she had no other choice but to send me there for 2 weeks. When I got there.. There was some WEIRD kids. I KNEW I was not supposed to be in there. I was a perfectly normal kid.. with anger issues. That's all. And after seeing some of those kids, My anger problems did not even compare to some of those other's.The reason it felt like jail?We had separate rooms, and separate bed-times depending on ages. No bathroom breaks past 9pm for me. It was bed time. I couldn't leave my room at all once 9pm hit. There was a small office in the hallway with a worker that would watch all doors in case someone decided to leave their room. My mom could only visit me every few days. (She was the only person I wanted to see).. I remember crying at the window when she left because I didn't want to be there. I also remember seeing her cry as she walked to her car and saw my pounding on the window wanting to leave that god-forsaken place. Every time she would visit, she would bring me a book to read. (It was the ONLY thing I was allowed to have in my room. 1 bed, books, and clothes. The rooms were cold, dull, and the bed was a cott. Early mornings, every kid was woken up at the same time to eat breakfast. EVERY DAY WAS ON A SCHEDULE.. and every kid was treated differently and had different privileges depending on age. The older kids got to play the N64 in the hallway. And I was forced to watch reading rainbow with other kids in the living room EVERY. FUCKING. MORNING. And to top it off.. I never liked that show. But was forced to watch it after breakfast.(To this day, I can't watch that show or even listen to the theme song because of how much hatred I have of it and flashbacks of this "jail" I was at.)After reading fucking rainbow, we would go outside and play.. I guess that was the only time I really enjoyed because I got to be outside. It was heaven to me.And at night, every kid had a schedule to take a 10 minute shower. Then go to bed after a snack and 15 minute play-time. (again, depending on age)Now, the only reason I feel I was considered a "weird" individual when I left was because of the one thing that I look back at and feel proud of because of how much I hated that place.Remember when I said there were no more bathroom privileges after we went to bed? Well, I needed to use the bathroom quite late every night. Was I allowed to use the bathroom even though it was 4 doors from my room? No.What did I do? I took the extra blanket off my bed, threw it in the corner and pissed on it every other night. For nights on end... When it was finally time to go home, I remember some lady coming in and grabbing my blankets and such. She went to the corner, picked up the blanket with both hands and asked "Why is this blanket soaking wet?"My answer? "I sweat a lot when I sleep""Why does it smell like pee?"My answer? "Some people's sweat smell like pee?"I look back at this memory now that I'm older and realize.. She definitely knew I pissed on it. Do I give a fuck? lolnope. Fuck that place.

Nina0509 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 20. I used illegal drugs for a good 6 years, finally got some help in my mid-late 20s and have since built a life for myself. I am now in my 30s, and it hasnt been smooth sailing. Still have ups and downs. But nothing like it was. I was volatile,  unlovable,  and incapable of loving another person.  Yes, this is an illness, but doesnt mean you have to pay the price. You sound like a loyal and caring person for even entertaining sticking this out. You can plant the seed, and maybe mention to this person that he needs help.

SalsaMan69 [info] the pichu main's response:&gt;A lot of you guys already know that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have told a hefty majority of you guys in private. Basically what that means for me specifically is that I have long periods of hallucinations and delusions where I am made to think things that are not true. I have been struggling with this since late last year, and really it's only gotten worse sense.&gt;I have a person who follows me around named Connor. I know for a fact I have told several people about him before, specifically Anna Zotta and Derf. He used to just follow me around and ridicule me but recently he has gotten much more threatening and he forces me to do things that I do not want to do.&gt;Another big symptom I have been having is more on the delusion side than the hallucination side. I have very vivid dreams that eventually turn themselves into false memories where I think things have happened to me when they really haven't. Talk to any of my close friends (Alex Nesler, Anna Zotta, 4%, Sp1nda, April Shaw, etc) and they will know that I am constantly out of my mind with crazy theories and stuff, and I thank them for not judging me and just telling me simply I'm being delusional.&gt;The past two weeks I have honestly been scared for my life. I was told that I was the target of a government experiment on the viability of the Esports industry and using influential people to control masses of the population. Connor told me I had poison in my blood that they could activate to kill me at any time to make me die. &gt;They needed me to become a very important and followed member of the community so that I could control people for them. I know I'm an asshole for throwing you guys under the bus like that but I was honestly scared for my life. I needed to get enough fans so that I could make them vote how I said or go to certain events that I wanted them to go to or whatever.&gt;So the only way I could think of to get a lot of fans was to capitalize on my knowledge of the inner workings of melee and my ability to hack the game. With the intent of making a name for myself as a low tier hero so I wouldn't be killed, I made a hack that would make Pichu's hitboxes bigger and stronger if you held the stick in the bottom left corner of your controller and held the L button while you started a match as Goggle Pichu. &gt;I tried to tell quite a few people I was cheating, but every person I told thought I was being delusional and that I had actually deserved the wins. People I told include April Shaw, 4%, Derf, cWeb, and Walt. They all wrote it off as me being delusional, but I couldn't prove it to them without the government figuring out I was warning people of their plans to control them, so I didn't dig into it deeper.&gt;I know this doesn't excuse my actions, I just had a lengthy phone call with my doctor and I have an appointment lined up for Tuesday at noon. I should have told more people even though I thought it would kill me to do so, I should have recognized I was being delusional. &gt;I am making plans to apologize individually to each and every person I beat with the hacked character and to pay 1st place payouts to every person who's bracket I ended with my hacked character. I don't expect forgiveness for this, but I felt I needed to explain my thought process. I have been banned from most of the NEOH/PGH events until I have turned 18 and have made reparations. &gt;Sorry for being a fuckup [info]  [info] 1467503295
Ashliss1995 [info] Opinions on test scores? Hi everyone I recently took a Asperger's/Autism test online the one provided by psychology tools https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient/scoreI took the test myself and scored a 44 out of 50. *The results had this to say Scores in the 33-50 range indicate significant Autistic traits (Autism)."Then I got my mother to take the test for me. Using the answers that she thought applied to me other than the ones that are personal that obviously I would have to answer. That way I would  have some sort of control because I didn't tell her what the test was for. When completed it scored 39 out of 50. I never been diagnosed with autism / Asperger's. I have been when I was a child around 7 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I'm 22 now and I don't agree with the diagnosis since I stopped seeing a psychiatrist around middle School.Apparently symptoms for bipolar doesn't show up until teens or early twenties. And the main thing is I don't have mania and apparently Asperger's is commonly mistaken for bipolar disorder.Mainly the biggest thing for me thinking I have autism / Asperger's is the social. Especially since reading more about autism.I literally have been having mini Epiphany / flashbacks of the countless times where I kept on talking about a subject or topic long after the person lost interest and the plenty of times that I said stuff it wouldn't be socially acceptable during the moment and just tons of stuff like that. even my mother said that I like playing alone when I was a child kind of went off to my own thing.And if I have Asperger's / Autism I definitely want to know so I can stay on top of things and work to get better with it. Basically the point of this post was to share your experiences with this test and to hear your opinions on if you guys think I have it or not. Also it's important to note I have family that is diagnosed with Asperger's. Thanks everyone! [info] None [info] 1581732762
zemorah [info] I think part of the reason, unlike other illnesses, is because you can't "see" it most of the time. Also, people with mental illness might go long stretches of time without visible symptoms so maybe people think they were exaggerating before or aren't as ill as they claim to be. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and my illness was quite obvious then. I've been off meds for awhile and function fairly well these days too. But there are still times I feel it creeping up on me. I think my long stretch of "normal" makes people think it isn't that serious. It's just as serious though but I've learned to recognize it and be proactive about it.I hope that makes sense.  [info] None [info] 1504415800
SkinnyMamaBean [info] How did you feel after being diagnosed? Did your bipolar diagnosis positively or negatively impact your life?I don't have the most supportive family when it comes to mental health, so a diagnosis would kind of be a secret between me and maybe two other people in my life. I have symptoms that I think point to bipolar disorder (been having what I think are hypomanic states). I don't want to try and self-diagnose, but I'm scared to get a professional diagnosis. I've seen a therapist before, but quit going a long time ago. So I need to find a new one. If I am diagnosed with bipolar or anything else, who would know? Like, who would be able to get that information? Just my therapist?Sorry, I know I'm at the point where I should really see a therapist. But I need a little reassurance I guess.

mjb8989 [info] StrawberryBlondeHaze I really can relate. I lost a lot of my friends to drugs after I decided to finally walk away from that life. It kills me to see where some of them are at now. But that’s where you just have to remember to care for yourself before anythingIt doesn’t matter how hard your goal is, you can 100% do it :) just take it slow and go day by day in the right direction to get you there. As long as you continue to progress, you will get to where you need to be. And if it’s not where you WANT, that just means you set yourself for something better that you never even expected, and I’m saying that from experience.Okay just a heads up StrawberryBlonde, what I just typed is long as f$¢€, but I did it because I just have this gut feeling I needed to share this story with you. So, you’ve been warned!I was in retail for 10 years in the wireless industry. Started at WalMart, went to work at some cell phone kiosk in a Sam’s Club, left there to work for Sprint, then AT&amp;T and then Best Buy. I stayed at Best Buy for 5 years and moved up to assistant manager of a small wireless store in the mall (I was previously a supervisor in a regular store) through the years, retail has just consistently drained me. I’m a musician and have always been very creative when it came to writing music. I always wanted to either be in a band and just tour all over, or work somewhere in the media. Well, I got in a band. One day, I decided to call my local radio station and ask if my band could come in and do an interview on air lol I mean, why not? Well holy shit the guy actually told me he would do it. So we did this really funny interview on air promoting a show coming up and even had a song played. The host of the radio show and I kept in touch. Come to find out, we had a whole lot in common. Networking, networking, networking.So eventually, he knew how much I loved music and media. Couple years later, the band broke up and I decided not to give it up and do my own solo stuff. Well sh!t, long story short I had my music regularly played on that same radio station on a weekend night show, did an interview with a station based out of Florida (I live in Virginia) had articles written up about my music, so an underground musician making and producing his own music in his apartment, things blew up way more than I thought. Let word, “producing”.My buddy from the radio station ended up getting fired (he was getting sick of the corporate attitude his bosses had and uh, had an episode) he took a job at a different broadcast station in the area and he was given his own morning show on a classic rock station. People in the area love this guy, so they followed him wherever he went. Bam, the show is a hit. Well one day we are talking (my solo stuff has kind of slowed down at this point, I started recording just for the fun of it) he asked what I had been doing lately and I had just finished recording a cover of Come Together from The Beatles, but it was like a way heavier version lol. I sent it over to him, and he loved it. Apparently, he didn’t know I produced my own stuff too. So he told me tomorrow morning, meet him at the studio at 4am and that we’re about to have some fun. Say whaaaaat.So for a few months, I produced different plugs for his show and occasionally would be on air with him taking calls for listeners whenever there was a fun, debatable topic (like where’s the weirdest place you ever threw up.. yeah lol) it was so much fun.. but then he got offered to move to Seattle and work on The Delilah Show.. womp.This whole time I was an assistant manager at Best Buy lol as much fun I was having, i was EXHAUSTED. Until I another guy from the old station my band interviewed at contacted me, “hey, I heard you’re in sales and have been wanting to work in the media?” The following month, I quit my job and started working for iHeartMedia.“Holy sh!t, my dream just came true! This is amazing! I have the job I’ve always wanted!”***3 months later***“Oh my god, I hate this job and my entire life.”The job I thought I always wanted turned out to be the job I hated more than any other job I ever had. Guess what happened? I lost my job, during the same time I was trying to plan my wedding, during the same time I was diagnosed with bipolar II and taking different meds every two weeks. I wanted to die. I wanted to die so bad, that I ended up staying in a mental hospital for 5 days after coming close to attempting suicide until I talked to my wife.I ended up back at Best Buy, but not a manager. I was a part time sales associate because they had no other available positions. My pay had almost been cut in half. I loved Best Buy, but I ended up hating it while I was there because management changed and they knew my experience, so they would take advantage of me to do work that I wasn’t getting paid to do. I felt like the biggest waste of life. I truly, 100% hated myself.Then one day, my old boss from Sprint calls me, who I haven’t talked to in years. “Hey man, I hope things are going well. I’m working for a new company and one of our partners are hiring for a position that I thought you’d really fit into.” Well okay, that sounded cool. I tightened my resume up and sent it to the email address he gave me. The next day I had an interview over the phone. The next week I had an interview over Skype, a few days later, one more phone interview that lead to an offer. Today, I’m working the most unexpected job I never thought I’d be able to have. I’m a territory manager for a company called Mosaic, who has a contract with a cell phone brand called tracfone, who’s accounts I manage are all in Wal-Marts. Talk about a vicious circle. I manage 54 stores across Virginia, drive around all day, visit stores for about an hour each and be on my way. They pay for my gas, they pay for my food if I’m staying out of town and they pay for my hotel. Once every month, I get to stay at VA Beach for 3 days in an oceanfront hotel. And financially, I’m making double the amount I made at iHeart. The best job I could ever ask for at this time in my life was the last thing I ever expected.This is in NO one way me trying to brag about anything. The only reason I’m telling you this and so much in detail is because I believe this can happen to anyone and everyone. Things connect together in the most strangest ways, we just have to keep our eyes and ears open so we don’t miss it. StrawberryBlonde (if that is your real name ;) ) you can be anything you want, and if not, you’re going to become the best version of yourself that you never even knew was possible. Trust me, it’ll will fall into place. Just know there will always be a struggle. I know this job I have now wont last forever. I also know eventually, I will struggle again. But I will survive, and just like I thought the band was my dream, and then working on radio as my dream, and then iHeartMedia was my dream... at some point, you realize it’s not worth wanting the “dream” when you’re always going to wake up eventually. Appreciate today, have faith in tomorrow. Alright, that’s all I got lol   [info] None [info] 1523399819
OldSpentQueen [info] Man, I can relate to just about everything here! I was diagnosed with bipolar II at 16, and am just starting to get it under control in my 30's. A few things: GET MEDICATED! If you don't have insurance, look into applying for SSI or SSDI. This will automatically enroll you in medicare. If you are medicated, it's time to talk to your pdoc and switch things up. I've been on more meds than I can even remember, but all that trial and error was worth it once I found Lamictal. It's night and day! The suicidal ideation and crazy lows are all but gone, which is something I NEVER thought would happen. This is what I imagine "normal"(Sorry, only word I could think of) people feel day to day. This should be priority before going back to school or finding work, I can tell you from experience.  Don't feel guilty about being supported by your family. I had very similar feelings for a long time. I have an amazing support system, and I felt like I had every advantage and just squandered it. This is toxic thinking. I obviously don't know your whole situation, but I'll assume since your family supports you financially that they love you and want to do what they can to help. If this is the case, feel blessed.  Feeling like you're a loser going nowhere sucks, but I'm pretty confident that's not the case for you. Try to focus on improving yourself all around. Finding the right medication is a big part of that, things like developing daily routines and eating better honestly help quite a bit. This can be frustrating in the beginning because it honestly doesn't feel like you're really doing anything constructive, but the baby steps add up and you'll ultimately feel a bit better about yourself and gain confidence.  I'm sorry for rambling, I'm a tad manic tbh. The last thing I want to bring up is friends. Once things start clicking and you're feeling a bit more stable this won't be a problem, I promise. Don't feel bad about having few friends in the meantime though. Late 20's and early 30's isn't like high school or college. I'm lucky if I see my best friend once a year, and most of the people I associate with are work colleagues. It's just a crappy part of growing up  Aaaaanyway, really sorry for the wall of text. Like I said, I'm a bit manic. There's tons more I'd like to talk about, but I'll cut myself off here. Please feel free to pm me if you need to talk, I've been where you are and it's horrible, but things will get better. Fair fortune [info] None [info] 1527898749
Chanchan012 [info] Weight loss and meds? Hey everyone. I was diagnosed with bipolar in October/November 2015 and at the time I weighed 57kg/125lbs. Rather quickly after being medicated with Lamictal (which I was assured wouldn't cause weight gain) I gained about 20kg. I was taking urbanol as well.I've since come off urbanol and now take depramil instead.I've tried to lose weight so many different ways. I gym regularly, I try eat healthy, I drink a lot of water... How can I go forward? I'm fat and sad. [info] None [info] 1529918523
GypsyRose_83 [info] I get it...I used drugs for years to feel normal because my altered state of mind felt right. My sober me was not who I thought I wanted  or needed to be. But I got older and my actions from doing drugs came with heavy consequences and I was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide from being depressed because I just did not understand why everyone and everything was against how I wanted to live.  Long story short I was diagnosed with bipolar while in the hospital. Learning about this illness and being medicated over the years has put sooo much into perspective of why I did the things I did and why they felt right and justified. I’m not saying I’m cured by any means but now it’s been almost 10 years since then and moved away from my home town and I now live a life I never thought I could.  A sober life.  I urge you to seek help for your addiction.  Good luck my friend [info]  [info] 1544002312
seeking_freedom [info] I am writing this post based on my own experience and acknowledging that everyone's mind and situation are different. Hopefully some of this turns out to be helpful for you, but always defer to your doctor. I was diagnosed with bipolar type II 6 years ago, and your post resonates strongly with me. Moving out of my parents' was the best decision I could've made for my mental health, because it removed so many triggers and negative experiences from my day-to-day life. Believe me, I know it's hard -- but it does get better. It doesn't ever go away completely, but you get better at knowing yourself and managing your symptoms so they don't spiral out of control (or at least, you know when to call for help). I've learned to recognize and validate my feelings, even when my logical mind knows they're irrational. For example, I might wake up feeling utterly depressed for no reason. So rather than beat myself up for not being happy, I'll think to myself, "All right, I am feeling depressed this morning. That is ok. Today is a down day. I'll make myself a hot tea to take to work, and maybe later have a relaxing bubble bath. Everything is ok. I have shelter, I have food and creature comforts, I have people who love me. Even though I feel very down, things are going to feel better eventually." Obviously when the depressed mood has a specific, stressful trigger, things work a little bit differently. And sometimes I've had to call into work "sick" to get a recovery day (use sparingly). But for most days when your mood just decides to act up on its own, positive self-talk and little self-indulgences do uplift :) My best advice? If you have a medication prescription, take it as consistently as possible, even if you feel like you don't need it. Try to eat a steady diet of good nutritional foods, and try to stick to a sleep schedule. Food &amp; sleep make a huge difference for me, but being bipolar means it's hard to control impulses and overcome insomnia. Some days will be easier than others, for sure, but striving for a schedule definitely helps. I wish you the absolute best on your recovery journey.  [info] None [info] 1425505693

SilverSword7 [info] I appreciate the prayers and I do believe God loves me. I suppose however that I also think he gives us challenges in life. Part of me very much believes that this is simply a challenge for my life that he has put in my life. I used to believe that I would be happy if I just mastered myself, that if I just had total control over what I did with my life, if I was hard working to a certain point and if I arranged my life to where I was progressing in all the areas of my life, then I would feel peace. But then I was diagnosed with bipolar and then it was like I could almost hear God saying that my beliefs wouldn’t be realized and I wouldn’t be able to have that kind of peace and that it’s simply apart of the cross to bear through life.

ligadeleyends [info] Lil' Mama so dope I fucked around and got addicted Hey so I saw your post about addictions and wanted to talk with you about being bipolar and being addicted to something. A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions, they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted, they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle, you need help mentally, like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle, or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something "cool" and "fun" so either way you go to your addiction, your life force, what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this, you're addicted to something.&amp;#x200B;But like, so what? I'm just speaking out loud here, but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends, and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down, I know the answer is "not really", BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end, they are what make life "okay". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit?&amp;#x200B;However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like, 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked, played League for 2 hours, THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life, as you can see.&amp;#x200B;Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do, and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.&amp;#x200B;Therefore I, like any other addict out there, don't know what to do.&amp;#x200B;If I decide to quit.1. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things?2. Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to "quit" addictions, one has to REPLACE addictions.3. When I am drowning in bipolar, which is often, what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell, everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place, and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore, what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse, not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems.&amp;#x200B;4. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100% on the things that I "love", being League of Legends and marijuana, and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man, why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man.&amp;#x200B;EDIT: Am I just considering improving my life is SUCH a BIG fashion (cause quitting my addictions WOULD be a huge change in my life) only because i'm swinging in the cycle? I mean, I really am addicted but is this will to quit just a temporary thing? [info] None [info] 1546445683

hndearden [info] April 11th. Five years ago today my mother died by complications from a suicide attempt. Three years ago I started taking lithium, treatment for bipolar type II.Three years ago this week, I went on my first date with the love of my life. It was raining, and she was 45 minutes late because her crutches didn't fit in the first few Ubers she called. She was the first person I told. "I'm diagnosed with bipolar." She sat there, paused like a VCR tape. Her response, "Ok." and we continued with our date. We've been together ever since.We all have big moments. Some are relentless and repetitive, some are instantaneous and spontaneous. April 11th is my amalgamation of moments; a funky ice cream sundae with all the emotional fixings.  Salty tuna, rich fudge, sour cherries. What I'm trying to say is, respect those you interact with today. You never know when they're dealing with their sundae.

I took off last spring to work and let my brain heal from the drugs (even ones I was prescribed, they screwed me up). I started using kratom as a replacement for stimulants and used lions mane and fish oil to help speed up the recovery process. I would say it worked well enough that over 6 months I finally feel somewhat normal again. The biggest improvement is my memory, which the difference is night and day. It was really bad.

Celarcade [info] Is there a reason that you can't tell your parents you've gone to a psychiatrist? Are you safe if they find out you've gone to see one? You're right: It would probably be relatively expensive to see one out-of-pocket if you don't make a lot of money. For my family, even $200 is a lot of money, so I totally understand. If it's just a matter of having an argument over it with your parents, I would put on my brave face and do it. You don't owe them an explanation. Just use the insurance and get the prescription you need. I also think you should use all the resources available to you, including those available at school. It probably won't replace the help of a real psychiatrist, but in conjunction with his/her help, it could make a difference. Even just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a few years. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type II with psychotic features. Before that diagnosis, I was also diagnosed with PTSD.

RavenSavage724 [info] For years I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It wasn't until I was hospitalized a few years ago that I was finally diagnosed BPD.

GWLlosa [info] Ritalin + (Welbutrin &amp; Seroquel) So i have ADHD and spent most of my life on high doses of Ritalin.  Recently I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given Welbutrin &amp; Seroquel to address those issues.  When i started those meds,  i stopped taking Ritalin just to lower the odds of some kind of drug interaction.  Now that the serum levels for Welbutrin and Seroquel have stabilized, is it a good idea to take Ritalin again?  I would ask my psychiatrist,  but my next appt isn't for weeks...

mremaids [info] Saddest part about my life is that I'm not successful. I grew up with immature addicts for parents, with an older brother and younger brother. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, aged out (18) of foster care which allowed me to go to community college for free and get a monthly payment of $400. I went to college, after graduating high school early in Dec., and was not prepared, dropped out two weeks before finals. I tried the fall semester after that, and dropped out even earlier. I was supposed to have this success story, become a published writer, but right now I'm an unemployed 19 year old, living with her grandmother. And I married my high school sweetheart. I'm happy, but all my mental health issues are holding me back from getting a job and finishing school.  [info] None [info] 1423294255

upunkrockbeezy [info] When I read your edit outlining your diagnoses I did a double take because I literally have every SINGLE thing that you listed, down to the #2 after bipolar...The ADHD label was slapped on in high school, two years later I developed PTSD after almost being murdered by my boyfriend, which was shadowed by panic disorder... then I spent the 10ish years that followed thinking I was just more fucked up than your average ADHD girl as a result of one too many head injuries. But last year after impulsively taking off to Reno with my $15,000 work bonus and spending (gambling) it in a matter of two days only to come back home and just quit my dream job for literally no other reason than it felt right, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and evolved into my final form: a shell of my former self, which actually works out because that leaves plenty of room within said shell to house my multitude of mental problems while still leaving plenty of room for all of the guilt, shame and self doubt that comes along with them.I am quite pleased to have finally encountered someone else like me, and I'm also really sorry that you can probably relate to a lot of the things that I've described. One thing that I will say though is that my being crazy af has resulted in me somehow raising two of the most sympathetic, patient and kind kids I could ever have asked for, with that perfect sprinkling of the greatest sense of humor that only comes from being raised in a shitstorm of dysfunction. Coping mechanism or not, they are some funny ass kids. [info] None [info] 1559999205
affrogg [info] Same here, it seems that the two go together more frequently than one might think. I was diagnosed with bipolar first, and then about two years later with ADHD. I’m hypomanic so the downs were really bad and the hypermanic episodes were brief and in frequent. After years of spending my evenings and nights angry, depressed and with a ridiculously negative outlook, The ADHD diagnosis came after my older son was diagnosed with it. I started to recognize the signs while I was researching it for him. What I saw almost perfectly described my childhood and my current situation. I’m 45, and so I was raised with the thought that ADHD is just a kid who runs around all the time and he just needed to cut it out while I “had so much potential” in school. tl;drMe too!

MyNameMeansPretty [info] I found this tonight and I am now both happy and very scared I grew up with one parent who has severely hoarded since I was about 5 years old and another who survives/enables. There are countless layers to that story. I left many years ago and have never set foot in that space again once I realized how detrimental it was to my mental/physical health. I had tried for many years to address the issue and the effects with both parents to no avail, often losing contact for months at a time because of it. I am an only child. I am not close to my other relatives, partly because of the secret I always have had to keep, partly because of the dissonance sown by my hoarding parent, and partly due to some shame/animosity that they knew and let me live like that. I have been diagnosed with bipolar as an adult. I experienced a divorce last year. I have no children. I rarely speak to my family, but my divorce had softened my defenses and this quarantine has made me lonely and sentimental. My parents love me, but that love is both nourishing and toxic due to their mental health issues and my own. Finding this forum will be good for me, I think. It will not be easy for me to deal with the things I have denied and suppressed but it is ultimately healthy to deal with those issues, and I appreciate the existence of a space to meet others with similar experiences. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1586755419
krv701 [info] Part two of my very long story that happened in 2018 Sorry for ending it in the middle I got upset and had to go to sleep 😅Okay so after they released me from jail I was scared to leave because I believed they were going to shoot me for escaping. The lady who took my finger prints yelled and told me to leave or else they will make me leave. I slowly opened the doors and I was downtown. I was alone until I looked across the street and saw my bf and his sister running across the street to me.I screamed and feel to the ground. They helped me up talking but I couldn’t understand them. We got to the car I sat in front. I believed they where talking to me on the radio. His sister turned off the radio. Colors where very interesting to me all the colors stood out. Stuff was coming off the street walls. They where asking me what happened and that I was getting charged with assault on a police officer. They were also pressing my mom to press charges from me attacking her. I thought they where out to get me to confess but I really didn’t remember anything. We got back home. I remember them asking me who they where. I called them by what color they were wearing. They asked me who my kids where in the pictures. Still they where purple and pink. I thought my bfs sister and bf where my oldest. My bf took me to the room and tried to get me to lay down. I thought he was going to molest me and I was calling him my molesters name from my childhood. I said well I guess we are doing this again huh (said his name) He was confused because I never told him that. Next I remember trying to jump out the window. Then two cops where at the bedroom door. I told them I needed to eat and took a handful of skittles and stuffed them in my mouth. I got scared thinking they where going to kill me so I spit them out and threw them at the cops.I remember being in the cop car telling them to put on the ac because it was hot. I told them they where cheating on their wife’s. We got to the mental hospital and they left me in the car. I screamed for them to leave the ac on. I saw my bf and his sister far way I was trying to get their attention because I thought I was going to die I thought the hospital was where I would die. Then I remember sitting in a chair and 3-4 nurses taking my vitals I was pulling everything off scared. A beautiful guy came in and calmed me down. He breathed with me so they can take my vitals. Then I remember being in a bathroom with a nurse and they asked for my pee.I peed and put on scrubs. The lady looked at my sample and said you smoke marijuana? I said yes. She then said how do you take meth, shooting? Smoking? Snorting? I said what?! Meth?! I don’t do that shit. I got so mad because I only smoke weed. You see weed freaks me out I can’t take anything else. Then she said ohhh it was a mistake that stuff happens all the time. Back in the room I had a burst of energy and I was running around and flipping off the chairs. They got me to sit down with the beautiful guy (not sure if he was real honestly) and I felt a sharp pain in my arm (antipsychotic) I was walking down a hallway with a shirt guy and he was talking about drug addiction and how I need to do better. He opened the door and there was about 15 recliners with people laying down with white sheets. I thought everyone was dead and I screamed for him to take me back. He said no ones dead see look and said hi everyone and everyone looked back at me and waved. I remember starting a fight with a girl because I thought she was my abuser. Next I’m being wheeled in another room with at least 40 recliners both male and female. I noticed they were letting people use the phone. I asked for the phone and called my mom. I begged her to come get me and that I was scared she told me I need to be there to feel better and I’m safe. She was crying. I hung up the phone and walked back to my chair. The lady next to me freaked me out so I left that area. I went back and called my mom told her the same thing she told me the same thing. I did that about 20 times in a row.Next I was in a dorm like place. It was time for bed but I really wanted to take a shower so a lady stood in the bathroom while I showered. That freaked me out. So I get to bed and woke up for breakfast. I was so sure they where going to kill me. I told a guy that they were going to kill me and he said no they are here to help eat and get ready to take meds. That guy helped me out so much I never got his name. I did see him after the hospital stay and he gave me his halfway address but I was still paranoid that he was going to kill me. So my time at the hospital was being scared to death and taking drug recovery group. My bf saw me everyday that was the highlight of my day. I was in the hospital for 7 days. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I was put on a antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. I also started therapy. I was deathly afraid of that ever happening again. My meds made me very suicidal. Then June 2019 my new therapist (so far I’ve had 4) told me I’m not bipolar and my episode was psychosis due to the meth. I had gone off my antidepressants very fast (a week) after being on them for two years so my brain was already freaking out.(without my dr knowing. I started to feel better and thought I didn’t need them) Then I got drugged by my neighbor with a blunt with meth in it. So it made me have psychosis. I’ve been off all meds since nov 2019. I’m still not okay but I’m not as suicidal as before. Thanks for reading my story not a lot of people know what happened in detail like this but it feels good to get it out here. To let people know to not get off your meds fast with out your dr knowing. To not trust anyone while taking drugs. A lesson i learned the very hard way. I’m still trying to see what good happened. Well at least they dropped all charges (don’t know why) I’m seeing someone for my past trauma. I still have my kids. And no one killed me. Again thank you for reading this it took a lot [info] None [info] 1582905599

colby-klaus [info] Three things:1. Voter fraud has never been widespread. It just hasn't. In the last decade, the total number of fraudulent votes that Voter ID laws would have stopped is in the hundreds. *Hundreds.* Out of, what, nearly a billion total votes? 99% of the votes people point at as fraud aren't things that Voter ID would stop, and aren't actually fraud. Someone who is registered in two places, because they forgot to void it after they moved? Not fraud, and it turns out people don't vote twice even when registered in two places. A felon who isn't legally allowed to vote, but does anyway? Incredibly rare, and those votes get caught. So, Voter ID proposals, as they are, have been a solution looking for a problem. 2. We both agree that access to the required ID is inconsistent and leaves some people without the reasonable ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote, correct? **Voter ID doesn't fix this.** IF a Voter ID law was introduced in my state and would introduce mechanisms to ensure that people like my grandpa could have the means to meet the requirements? I'd support it! But I haven't seen one yet. Know why? Because that would need tax dollars, and (in my state at least) the sheer mention of spending is akin to being told your favorite sports team is garbage. Literally, in Nebraska, our republican governor has rejected proposals to lower property taxes **for the very people who elected him** because the only solutions involve increasing or introducing a different tax that spreads the burden more fairly. Why? Well, he signed a pledge to not raise or create taxes. 3. Undermining democracy. Have you heard of CrossCheck? It's a program that was introduced in Kansas about a decade ago, and has spread into other states. It purges people from voter rolls if they have similar names. These people aren't notified, they may have no idea they've been purged until the day they go to vote. Is your name John Smith? There's probably 100 of you in Kansas. All of you just got purged, without knowing. Is your last name Gonzalez? Well, there's 15 other people with that last name, and even though your first or middle names may be different, it still seems suspicious. So, you're purged. Now, with Voter ID, you've been purged, you don't know you've been purged, and you show up to the voting booth to be told you're not registered and must present your birth certificate, your photo ID, and some other document. Do you have your birth certificate at home? I know I don't. The one time I needed it for anything, I had to wait a week to get a copy because I lived in a different state than where I was born. And I've moved so many times since then, I couldn't tell you where it ended up. So you just got purged, you can't provide every item needed to cast a ballot, and **if you're absolutely lucky** you might get to cast a provisional ballot that will never get counted. Does that not sound like it undermines democracy more than the possibility of 1 person in your entire state committing voter fraud? Because, remember, the only known cases so far of actual voter fraud **nationwide** in the presidential election totaled 5 out of 120,000,000 votes. Yes, there have been cases in the past where local elections have been rigged, but again, **Voter. ID. Wouldn't. Stop. That.** Ballot stuffing, intimidation, paying for votes, that's stuff that Voter ID will never fix, and has nothing to do with individual voters like the people in this article. The thing is, I can't point to anyone in my group of friends and acquaintances who is opposed to the idea of an ID for voting. What they're opposed to is the **implementation** presented by proponents of Voter ID laws. And the reasons I've listed are exactly why. But our concerns are dismissed if they're ever even heard. We're told we want to bus people from Mexico to make Trump lose California, that we want to drive people from poll to poll to poll to poll and fill out a dozen ballots, that we don't care about democracy and hate America. All we really want is for people to look at the long-standing facts and guarantee that any law they introduce will address these concerns. That's it! That's all we want! And thank you for your kind words. We have our struggles, because I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD, our farm doesn't make enough for me to afford insurance, meds, and therapy, and after four years of living with him he still has trouble understanding what any of it means. But we've built something that's working, and I know I've improved his life by looking out for him.  [info] None [info] 1494724941

TheAfro11 [info] Just had an episode While I was trying to repair a lawnmower yesterday, I experienced an episode of this "fast feeling". After spending 30 minutes trying to fix the lawnmower, I perceived that my hands were moving moving faster than normal, something I  immediately thought was a symptom of a mental disorder of some sort.Today, I woke up earlier than usual and stumbled across this subreddit, and now I'm making this post at 5AM. This had me thinking, is this "fast feeling" a symptom of a manic episode? I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 two years ago, and I recall that during one of my manic episodes, I experienced several of these "fast feelings".Anyways, it would be interesting to hear some thoughts about this.

ForTheLongestTime [info] I cannot even express how frustrating that is. I was diagnosed with bipolar-II in April, after dropping out of school because I could neither think, sleep, remember peoples names, or go to class. I had these problems since last December, which makes this the fourteenth month of symptoms. I've gone to neurologists, sleep labs, psychiatrists, psychologists, had extensive blood panels, and more. From what I've read, and in my opinion, I may be on the bipolar spectrum, but I'm not at all full-blown Bi-polar II. I simply have never had a manic, hypomanic, or even excited episode. Even my psychologists agree that I don't present, nor have I ever presented, with manic or hypomanic symptoms. So, in short, while I have a very sharp and dedicated psychiatrist, she simply has not addressed the problem in any way. I dropped out of my tier-1 research university, turned down the biggest research opportunity of my life, and haven't been able to read well for fourteen months. Obviously I'm very frustrated. I think that I, like everyone else in my small town, walks into the office, says they're having a hard time, and is instantly diagnosed with bipolar-II. As a not-so-funny-anecdote, I think the best part about going to see her is doing the backwards numbers test. Prior to this, I could do 9 - 10 with 75% consistency. Doctors will say that this is pretty good, but all of my friends seem to be able to do about 8 - 9, so I highly doubt it is. Well, currently I can do about 7 - 8 at 75% consistency, and 9 at 25%. My mother can do better. My psychiatrist constantly reminds me, when I say that I am far, far away from what I used to do, that I do better than everyone in her office. Then I remind her that almost everyone else she sees is a geriatric. tldr: I don't think I'm bipolar, and I've lost 10 months of my life to a woman who thinks I am. That felt good.

ex_animo_anibella [info] I have Bipolar Disorder. NMom doesn't believe in the illness. Ex husband defended me/shut her down! Ok. Here we go. First post (I love lurking. You're an awesome group!). Might be a tad long. Backstory: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 14, and it was still called manic depressive disorder. I spent the first 10 years on the full spectrum of medications. It's all trial and error, you see. What works for one person, might make another person worse instead of better. Eventually I opted for cognitive behavioral therapy with emergency medication support only. Basically, when I'm manic/on a high, I take Valium and come right down to normal. This happens for 4-5 days at a time, once a month (thanks lady cycles!). The point: two weekends ago I had a bad manic/psychotic episode. I ended up on the highest amount/duration of Valium I've had in over a year. My ex had to help me with our girls a LOT. So of course, my NMom heard about it offhand, and zeroed in. Two days after it ended my NMom stops by to "check" on me. She immediately hones in on my most recent episode, and the drug I use to treat it:"Is it safe?""Won't you be addicted""You don't use it ALL the time, DO you?!""What if you pass out and....&lt;insert crazy death scenario here&gt;""Can't you just (insert random dietary/herbal/natural "cure" here) instead?"I could go on, her verbal sewage is endless. She does this every time she finds out I had an episode, and needed medical treatment. She seems to not be able to grasp that I have an actual mental illness, or that she isn't involved in my medical/psychiatric care (which she doesn't believe I need). Either way, I've dealt with her my whole life, and after a few minutes of this, I just look at her and say something along the lines of:"You don't have any Fucking right to ask me these questions. You aren't concerned. You're uneducated and nosy. You just want to be in the middle of everything "Conversation over. She leaves. Monday night, my ex stops by to tell me a story:NMom called him after being at my house. She went on and on about the Valium and the million horror stories and "expert advice" she's concocted over the years. She goes as far as to say "but she wasn't like this before?! She never needed any of this before!?"  To which my ex calmly and clearly replied "actually, she was and you know that. I've heard all about it, and was there for the last 5 years of dealing with this. We have the same Doctor". And then he just went broken record and kept repeating that and variations of it, very calmly, while adding in that I have very good medical care, and that no, he would not provide any of my doctors information to her. He didn't play into it. He didn't react. And he defended me.  I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting, but wow!!! He stood up for me! And shut my NMom down. No one has ever done that for me before ❤️ [info] None [info] 1468004593
mattsulli [info] I had a fiancée before I married my wife. During an alcohol withdrawal stint at a hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment and let my behavior get worse and worse until she finally left me. I beat myself up over and over again, cutting, lashing out, drinking, spending days crying and other days going out trying to get myself killed on the streets of Baltimore. When I spent a couple of years dealing with this and getting a little better, I met my now wife. I was honest with her about my disorder but lied pretty heavily about my past. When I eventually got on some insurance plan I started seeking treatment. I became more honest with my wife about my past because I began to understand that as long as I got better I could unload the truth and she would understand. She has. Past that, getting on meds and understanding the nature of my old behaviors has allowed me to come to terms with losing a woman whom I loved dearly. I don’t know why I’m typing all of this out.

italiansolid [info] Full time Dad slowly loosing his grips. I'm going to make my life story/situation as short and sweet as possible. And mainly to get it off my chest. &amp;#x200B;Graduated from a good private high school, family always loving, hard times existed no doubt growing up in lower middle class Louisville Kentucky. Went to college and met a woman first semester. She had a 3 year old back at home that was taken away from her, and she was pregnant when we first met. I decided to take care of her she wanted to do an adoption for the baby. I ran away with her to Louisiana where the adoptive family was, and I ended up getting married to her and got my first apartment. &amp;#x200B;Jump a few years, we moved back to Kentucky, went to a few more colleges online, went through some hard times/ robberies/ ect. Decided to buy a house in central Kentucky. Had my first born son :))). I've held my job as a Quality Tech for 7 years now, even though its a good job and I like what I do I'm underpaid. I take home about  28k a year. Wife never worked consistently. &amp;#x200B;Caught Wife in a couple affairs, and some money related issues through about 3 years apart. I forgave her. But you can forgive and not forget. Jump ahead a few more years decided to join the United States Marine Corps Reserve, I went into boot camp while she was pregnant with our second son. Found out she had ovarian cancer and they stationed me close to home. I ended up getting an honorable hardship discharge. Second son came out in great health which was a miracle.&amp;#x200B;When I got home I found out she hasn't paid the mortgage in 2 years, and I was protected from foreclosure because I was active duty military. I was missing about 11k in savings and I had 4 credit cards opened up in my name. But I carried on and forgave her. &amp;#x200B;Skip about a year I got my house caught back up and everything was going okay again financially. She ran up to me on the front porch and started making out with me with a bunch of makeup on I knew something was off. Yes another affair. This time I caught her doing drugs as well. She went to a mental hospital, then to rehab, then to another rehab. &amp;#x200B;I couldn't really afford a lawyer so we did an uncontested divorce 50/50 joint custody. I gave her the house with everything in it and decided to move out I felt like I did my job. I got an apartment nearby and we did every other week with our 2 boys. It lasted about 3 weeks. She decided to move near her new boyfriend about 30 mins north, she lost her job, wasn't paying on the house I gave her. Now she's homeless with multiple warrants out for her arrest. She also has a bench warrant for the courts because she failed to go to the parenting class twice. &amp;#x200B;Now I've had my boys for about 10 weeks now, and we haven't heard from the ex wife. Technically I don't even know if she is my ex wife because the court still hasn't finalized the divorce because she failed to go to the classes. I haven't gotten a penny from her either. &amp;#x200B;So hear me out. This is my situation. I owe about 37k in student loans, 10k in other debts that are in collection that the ex opened up in my name. Wages are getting garnished this week from the Department of Defense because the USMC overpaid me, daycare is 200 a week, my boys are 6 and 2.  Cabinet Health and Family services said I make too much for any assistance, can't afford a lawyer. Budget comes out to about -350 a month without adding any groceries that's just bills only. &amp;#x200B;So I guess is what I'm trying to say is that I love my two boys with all my heart and none of this is going to get me down. I will survive through all this. My mind is callused. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and I haven't had a single episode since the separation, why? Because I'm in flight or fight mode. I'm a combat hunter and I'll do whatever it takes to raise these two boys and turn them into men. Because one day they are gonna realize who was there and who put in the work. Its easy to feel like I'm done for and hopeless but what good is that going to do my family? Sorry reddit I just needed to vent. From the outside I look like an excellent dad who has his shit together. I may not be superman but I will make sure these boys get everything they need to set them up for success.

Wlcome2enemyturf [info] I've had sleep problems my entire life.  I started acting depressed when I was about 9 and it progressively got worse until I was about 16.  That's when I think the mania started since I was first prescribed antidepressants and the rebellious behavior started.  I had a drug problem which was really just me trying to self medicate.  I've had several different diagnoses bounced off me until I finally gave up and stopped seeing psychiatrists and therapists until a couple months ago.  That's when I was diagnosed with bipolar and it made a lot of sense.  But to answer your question, I have never felt normal.  I haven't really fit in, always been an oddball (not socially awkward, just lonely).  [info] None [info] 1397023226
Devils_Advocaat_ [info] My partner is exactly like you. I never cut myself, but I did take painkillers and alcohol to numb the pain. My stepmother was a complete waste of skin who caused a physical injury that will affect me for the rest of my life, and stops me from doing some things.Then I had a horrible marriage, and finally,within the last 12 months I have given 3 eulogies for 3 very close family members. I was acting very weird. My amazing boyfriend didn't judge, was always calm (he works in an industry where he HAS to be calm) and just told me to do whatever I needed. Then a few weeks ago I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 (milder highs, longer depressive episodes.) He has a degree in psychology and knows more about it than I do, and still hasn't run for the hills. His patience and calmness are so, so important.You remind me of him a lot. If you continue to be there for her calmly, quietly, and without judgment as you have been) you guys will be fine. Make sure she keeps up the therapy so you don't get empathy burnout - but otherwise, I have a good feeling about you guys. [info] None [info] 1487890366
BornToClaire-ify [info] Years ago, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on a medication that actually slowed my heart down because that's how my panic attacks/episodes would start -- increased heart rate, then shortness of breath, a feeling of the world caving in... I'm sure you know the feeling.I hated the medication. It was great if I were to have an episode, but on normal days, I felt like a zombie in slow motion.About 6 years ago I weened myself off the medication by talking myself down when I felt an episode coming on. I'd like to share what I do now with you, in an effort to help.*Close your eyes.  Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.  When you breathe in, do it for 2 beats: I-N.  When you breathe out, do it for 3 beats: O-U-T.  Count your breaths.  For each one, picture the number in front of you, large and 3-Dimensional.  Now as you inhale, picture the number filling up with water.  As you exhale, picture the water draining.  Do this for as many breaths as it takes to slow your heart, and feel like your feet are on the ground again.  The sweet spot for me is about 15.*It doesn't take long. You can do it in a bathroom stall at work, and no one will be the wiser. It's *really* helped me, and I hope it will help you, too.Please reach out if you ever need help. I have never been a preschool teacher, but I have had my fair share of panic attacks and episodes, and I would be more than willing to help. [info] When you cross me, you better don't cross me.

anarchyarcanine [info] I wish you both the best. I was diagnosed with bipolar and PTSD in 2010, when I was only turning 18, and then a few years later was told I had Gen. Anxiety Disorder. It's scary at first. It's gonna feel freaky, but the best thing to do is to keep it from defining you. I've had the hardest time with that, because it's been a rollercoaster for me with tons of meds, and dealing with new situations and recurring/new symptoms, but you have to remember that you are still a person underneath of it, one that is valuable and precious and wonderful.You don't have to tell a single soul. For me, the people I trust know, and I only tell other people if it might be beneficial for them to know in order to understand me better. The sucky part for me is having to explain to people that PTSD is not just a soldier's disease, but having to only vaguely explain why I have it because I don't feel okay with telling people my story.You two are gonna be just fine. Get treatment that you are comfortable with, and think will be best, if you choose to treat it. But above all, remember to take care of yourself first and foremost. Do what makes you feel happy and safe, and check in with yourself now and again to make sure that you're still doing that. If not, figure out how you can change it. It's sometimes a continuing self-discovery.  [info] None [info] 1435480680
laserdragon [info] First off, don't feel bad for relying on people! You're a human being, and that is one of the things we do. It's completely natural. Secondly, I have experienced these things also. I had [psychosis](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248159.php) after experiencing a traumatic event 3 years ago, and I'm still dealing with it. Socializing has been somewhat difficult for me ever since.I have been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. However, I'm not a mental health professional. If you're in school and feel comfortable with it, perhaps you could talk to a counselor. If you're in college, you should be able to see one for free if you're currently enrolled or going to continue next semester. If you're not in school, you could also see if there are any counselors or therapists that your insurance will cover.If you're uninsured, there might be free or low-income clinics in your area, just make sure that they have mental health services. Same with seeing a psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner working underneath a psychiatrist, they could possibly prescribe you medication to help with possible delusions. I take an anti-psychotic (I know, the name sounds horrendous), which is prescribed for delusions and/or hallucinations in people with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder.Like I said, I am not a professional, and it would be best for you to talk to them so that you will receive a proper diagnosis and proper help. Sorry for my long comment, hope I helped at least a little :) [info] None [info] 1466143648
salty-MA-student [info] I have been seeing a black shadow since Fall 2013. It keeps beckoning for me to come towards it. In fall of 2013, I started working in a seasonal haunted house that is located inside an old penitentiary. After working there for about 2 weeks, I noticed a black figure about 5'5 in the corner of my eye while I was doing my makeup for the haunt. It made a beckoning motion to me. When I fully turned to see what it wanted, it vanished. I didn't see it again until a month later when I was at my grandparents house. I was standing in their hallway, and again- it looked like it was making the motion to come towards it. I turned to the figure and it lingered for an extra second before vanishing into the utility closet. No one but myself was in the house at the moment. A few days later, I was at the townhouse I lived in during college. Both my roommate and I were upstairs. I went to walk downstairs, and it was waiting by the foot of the steps, almost crouched. When I fully acknowledged its presence, it slid into my air vent. With three different sightings, I was becoming increasingly worried something intelligent followed me home from the penitentiary. The shadow is intelligent. It isn't popping up in the dark or in corners, it appears in broad daylight. It is making motions to come towards it. Since the initial sighting in 2013, the shadow appears at least once a month. Sometimes it appears before significant events- it doesn't matter if they are happy or sad. A miscarriage, a friend coming to visit, before a big breakup- it appears. Most of the time, it appears peripherally. It will stay there and make beckoning motions. When I fully acknowledge it, it'll linger for maybe 5 seconds, then slide up or down the wall into a vent or closet. I have never gone to it. The first time I saw it in my full field of vision was in June of this year. I went on vacation with my family at a beach. As I was walking into the elevator, it appeared just slightly to my left, and shook its head. I didn't go on the elevator. Later that day, we discovered that the specific elevator I was going to go into stopped working for a few hours. That's the first time its truly warned me about a bad event. The funny thing is that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I have been on anti-psychotic medications for 2 years now. Throughout my life, I've had hallucinations that consist of bright light with shapeless visual disturbances, never a full human-shaped object. I was hoping after starting medications I would cease seeing it, but nope. I just want to know what it is, what it wants. I'm pretty positive it's an attachment from when I worked in the penitentiary. It's definitely startled me, but I don't feel scared or a sense of dread when I see it. I want to know why it wants me to come towards it. [info] None [info] 1565559706
fujifilm96 [info] I'm not going out much, and I do have some people that I talk to in uni. I don't hang out with them, though. They're more of acquaintances, and I don't feel confident enough to hang out with them (idk if that makes sense). I'm tired all through the day, but I can get my homework done. Uni is really manageable, actually.I didn't know if it was my depressive moods coming back. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a couple of years back, but the past 6 months have been great and honestly I thought I was cured from it. I thought that it was a matter of motivation, or rather the lack of it. I've given it a bit more thought and from reading everyone's comments here and I think I'll agree that maybe my mood is worsening. I'll look into it and speak to my psych when I next meet her I guess. Thank you for your help anyway :) [info] None [info] 1556610383
purplebromine [info] Lamotrigine and appetite changes I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in late January this year after a disrupting hypomanic episode. I was put on valproate (depakote) starting at 500mg and then raised to 1000mg. It didn't do much for my mood but made me gain 15kgs of weight in six months instead. I wish I was exaggerating. I feel so fat, and people keep asking me if I am pregnant.I talked to my doctor about it and he decided to switch me over to lamotrigine (lamictal). I am starting with 50mg once a day for two weeks and then titrating up to 50mg twice a day (for a total of 100mg per day). I started taking the medication on Thursday and I feel like my appetite has reduced. It's not that I don't feel hungry anymore, it's just that I don't have as much of an interest in eating for pleasure. I am actually eating less and I am really pleased with this! Anyway, I want to know if this effect is placebo or if it's here to stay. Would love to hear this subreddit's experience with this! [info] Bipolar NOS [info] 1500198601
greenblueyellowe [info] Bipolar ladies? Bipolar 1 and pregnancy (med-free) I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 since 2012. I have been med free since the beginning of July, when I found out we were expecting. It was planned. I was on a low dose of lamictal before I found out. Other than some depressed moods and irritability, I have actually been doing okay. I had to get a new psychiatrist during all this, because my old one left. The new one wanted to put me on Latuda at my first visit, but my Obgyn said not to unless I am having worse symptoms. I guess it's not just birth defects but the medicine affecting the baby at birth/causing unnecessary complications. I think what I have going for me, through all of this, is that my husband has been there for me through *past* episodes of psychosis. He knows when something isn't right. My goal has just been to keep the pregnancy and myself as healthy as possible. As many people with bipolar have understood, it is sometimes very hard to recognize when you are going "off the edge" by yourself. So having my husband helps a lot!My next step is to come up with a "postpartum plan" for meds after delivery. I am meeting with my psychiatric NP this month so that we can have a plan. This was discussed at my last Obgyn appointment and honestly I can't wait to get back on meds after he's born (3/18 due). Not gonna say that I am severely depressed, but I am dealing with low moods. Also, I feel irritable for literally no reason and it is not fun...I don't get aggressive or angry outwardly. My irritability/anger inside however, feels "out of control" for the situation. I guess I am just not one of those "mess of tears" like some pregnant ladies, more just angry lol. Well that's all I wanted to say. If there are any bipolar ladies out there, feel free to ask any questions! [info] None [info] 1578766659
Bleeglebeagle [info] Is mania induced curiosity a thing? I'm on mobile, so please excuse any weird formatting. Okay, so I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 19. I am now 24 , and I've noticed after taking Prozac for a while that my mania has been getting slightly worse. I've also noticed that during mania, I have insane amounts of curiosity. Meaning, I constantly think about random things that have no effect on my life whatsoever. I spend a lot of time googling and researching random topics that I would otherwise not necessarily care about. During my depressive stages, I don't care enough to look into anything unless I absolutely have to. So, I'm wondering if mania induced curiosity is a legitimate thing? Am I the only one who experiences this? I've experienced other common things during mania, such as hyper focusing and having an insane amount of energy, but lately I've noticed that my curiosity has almost been uncontrollable: it disrupts my daily life. Please tell me that I'm not the only one. [info] None [info] 1539815154
wastedhum [info] How to start a hobbie to distract myself when I'm having an episode? About a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolarity, started taking meds (Lithium carbonate and a combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine) stopped taking them after a month because of the side effects, since  then I haven't taken anything or going to therapy... honestly I'm scared of going to therapy again because I don't want take meds again because of the side effects and it makes me  anxious to make my mom to spend a lot of money. Right now in a relationship and want to do better. when I'm having an episode I say mean things to my boyfriend and I don't want to hurt him anymore,  we've talked and I told him that I'm starting therapy again once I save up enough money,but in the mean time I want to do something about it.

Brocolli12345678 [info] I started taking Lamictal for my second time a couple months ago. I don't remember my experiences the first time but this time it's definitely positive. A day or two after I started the 25mg I went from 12 hours of sleep a night down to 8-10. That was huge for me. I didn't start feeling better til I got to the 150 dose, which I started I think two or three weeks ago and I started feeling better soon after. Lamictal is prescribed often for bipolar, and I've heard more good than bad about it, especially compared to other drugs.About antidepressants- after I was diagnosed with bipolar I was told I can't be on antidepressants anymore because it might make me manic. I have type 1 maybe that's why, idk. Ask your psychiatrist why some people with bipolar can't take antidepressants, maybe he/she'll know. [info] Schizoaffective [info] 1532107616

personalhub [info] “Mentally Ill” Though out the last 3 years of my life I had a best friend, she was there for me all the way. When people started leaving she stayed. I will always be thankful for that. Anyways, about 6 or 7 months ago we grew closer than ever and decided to start dating. It was going okay all till I had the worst breakdown of my life. Being diagnosed with bipolar disorder felt like the end of my life. I hated the fact of knowing I was ‘unstable’, thought I could never be normal. I never told her and still have yet to tell her I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. All I did that night was completely break down telling her she deserves better, I’m too unstable, and then I broke up with her. After our break up, the day after I gather myself together and got myself medicine because I wanted to desperately ‘fix’ myself. After just a few days or about a week, it helped me dramatically. It was like putting on glasses for the first time, you never know how bad your eyesight really is until you fix it (I hope that’s a good analogy). She saw me going from a terrible breakdown to getting better in nearly an instant after we broke up (still no clue what I was going thru, how I got on meds, etc etc, she’s in the blind and only saw an instant change after we broke up). She now calls me ‘mentally ill’, I have yet to tell if it’s a joke or not, it stings. She’s never called me this before. Her complete attitude towards me just seems like it’s changed. I just wish I could explain everything. I just don’t know how to randomly bring up the whole thing, I can tell she doesn’t like talking about our break up either. I just desperately wish I could apologize to her that she had to see me that way, that I shouldn’t choose for her as to what she deserves, and explain what I was going thru. Telling her about how I just couldn’t handle at the time being diagnosed with being bipolar, how after medication my life started looking up, how I wish I could’ve handle and done things differently.

MoxSkeleton41 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (currently super well treated; no one figures it out until I tell them), and a few years into my treatment I almost died from a painful and inexplicable illness. Later on, doctors found out I have Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, which means I can't take most of the medications available for bipolar people. It also has an 80% mortality rate. I stopped taking several of my medications cold turkey, went through pharmaceutical withdrawal, and did inpatient electro-convulsive therapy.Now I'm well medicated (without any neuroleptics), I just transitioned off of benzodiazepines (the hidden epidemic), and I'm more stable than ever before!

hello_world222222 [info] I hate feeling like this (sad post/venting) I used to think that life gets better as I grew older, but this illness has made me realize it's only going to get worse. I used to be full of energy, somewhat outgoing, and was mostly happy with my life until I hit high school. I slowly fell into a very deep depressed state, but covered it up until I was 19, which made me completely lose my sense of self, my goals, my future, As I grow older my mood when I'm in a depressed state keeps getting worse. I have  started to experience paranoia for the first time, and have more thoughts of suicide during my episodes. I already haven't felt motivated/happy in years and I'm now realizing it's only going to get worse. It's like what's the fucking point? Why dont I just give up?I was diagnosed with bipolar earlier this year by my psych. Initially I thought there was no way I'm  bipolar, but it makes so much sense now that I think about my periods of increased energy and much better mood which always leads to drug use. Other than those periods of hypomania I just feel so much sadness and hate for myself, and it's so much worse when coming down from being hypo. During these manic episodes I somehow ALWAYS manage to think "wow this medicine must have started working!" and "I'm finally getting better." It just hurts me so much to go from succeeding in life and doing very good in college(which is literally my only goal) to a complete fucking failure who can't even make it to class. It's leading me to smoke a lot more weed and abusing my adderall prescription just for the false sense of motivation/energy/ and a brief escape.  Sorry for the long post everyone. I never talk about my true feelings with friends/family for obvious reasons. I don't know how much longer I can take this. [info] None [info] 1544171867

milkiebuttle [info] This year, I will stop letting my mother control who I want to be and how I feel about myself. Let me preface this story by starting from the beginning. When I was 5, my older brother died in a car crash. This tore my family apart as you can imagine. Growing up was tough for me. My mum was forever on edge and anything will trigger her. It was especially hard when my dad worked nights and eventually moved overseas for work. In the worst of times she stripped me naked and threw me out of the house or she told me she would rather I have died rather than my brother. I was no more than 10 on both occasions.Having grown up in this environment, I was depressed and anxious from a young age. When I was 18, I was diagnosed with bipolar and an eating disorder. My mum ridiculed me and said that I was weak.I always tried to give my mum the benefit of the doubt. She lost her son; she herself was hurting that’s why she hurt me. We’re Asian so it’s culturally okay for her to call me fat and make fun of me although I know I am NOT fat and she knew about my E.D. We have good times together too so that makes up for the bad times.Eight years ago, I met the love of my life who helped me through dark times. He helped heal me. Last year, he asked me to marry him and I said yes.It’s been a few months now and my mum has not expressed any happiness for me. She is acting as if my engagement is something to be ashamed of. She’s telling me not to wear the ring or post on social media. She has told me multiple times that my fiancé is not good enough for me and that she hated him. This really hurts me because apart from my dad, he is the person I love the most. He is the one who protected me and it makes me sad that I can’t even protect him from her.But I am so tired of her behaviour. I have lived like this for 20 years. I have let her choose how I should live my life. Even subconsciously I do everything I know will keep her happy or keep my safe from her.But from 2019, I am making a pact with myself to stand up for myself. I will no longer let her change the way I feel about myself or let her tear down everything I have built for myself. I will no longer put up with it and say that it’s ok. She may be hurting but I am too. I have not had a suicidal thought in a long time but today I felt that creeping back again and that is not ok. I swear to myself that I will not let her hurt me anymore. [info] None [info] 1546519992

I'd like to hear more about what other things work for you. Exercise? Diet? Routine? Sobriety?

gdet5 [info] AITA for shouting back? My mum and I get into a lot of arguments, we don't have a very healthy relationship. A lot of the time she'll turn things back on her and say shit like "you never think about my feelings" and "you never worry about me". I can't really control my emotions, which my mum should know especially since my happiness fluctuates a lot and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A lot of things I say are in the heat of the moment and I always apologise afterwards if I say something hurtful, which I usually don't because I'm pretty scared of her ngl. The thing is, she never apologises for saying hurtful things to me but I always apologise for doing things wrong. She's said stuff like "you're an embarrassment to this family" and "I'm going to send you somewhere else, I can't deal with this anymore" and yet she never thinks about how her words affect me. The meanest thing I've said to her is "I hate you", which I did end up apologising about. Every time we argue and she shouts at me, I shout back and stand up for myself, to which she responds with "don't you dare raise your voice at me" most of the time. Am I an asshole for shouting at her? I understand that she does a lot for me (feeds me, makes sure I have clean water everyday, etc) but I really just can't control my anger and I'm not just going to stand there and let her shout and swear at me. I get angry about a lot of things and tbh that runs in the family, my whole family gets angry over the smallest of things yet they're all so blind to it. I'm grateful that she doesn't hurt me anymore but I'd really like if she was just calmer about things and actually took into account my feelings [info] Partassipant [1] [info] 1560880881
KattyB [info] Medication you don't need to take every day? I was diagnosed with bipolar II about a year and a half ago. I was put on Abilify, and stayed on it for about 6 months. At first I wasn't even sure if it was doing anything, but then I started feeling really dull all the time, my libido went way down, and I gained 30 pounds within that 6 month time-frame. At the end of that 6 months, I was in the process of moving and was too far away to visit my psychiatrist, and was irresponsible and didn't bother to find a new one. So, I did the thing that people say never to do: I stopped taking the Abilify cold-turkey. What followed was the worst manic episode I have had so far. I made it through (though my relationship suffered greatly), and have been off medication since (for a little less than a year now). I really feel the need to be on some sort of medication again, but I really hate the idea of being on a continuous medication that I have to take every day. I fear becoming dependent on a medication, especially one that is as expensive as Abilify (costs $450 a month). While my parents were kind enough to pay for the medication, I know that I will not always have their financial support, and I'm studying to become a Vet Tech, which I know will not make me all that much money. I've heard of people being prescribed medications such as Xanax and Adderall for bipolar. My assumption is that these people take Xanax when they are feeling anxious/hyper from mania, and Adderall when they are feeling depressed/low-energy/inability to focus. Is this assumption true? I like the idea of only taking medication to treat the symptoms when I feel the need to, and being medication-free when I feel fine. I am typically on a four-month cycle, in which I feel normal for four months at a time, followed by about 2 &amp; 1/2 months of a manic/depressive episode. Since I feel fine for the majority of each year, I really don't want a medication that makes me feel dull and low-energy all the time. On the other hand, the mood swings that occur every four months are completely intolerable and life-altering.I know that most people say that a consistent, daily medication is the best way to treat bipolar, but since I am so against taking a daily medication, I would really like to explore other options. Any good advice out there? And any suggestions on how to approach this subject with a new psychiatrist? [info] None [info] 1290638903

BipolarBlue23 [info] A couple personal tips (and musings) from a 23-year veteran of Bipolar Disorder I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 23 years ago.For me, the main clues that mania are approaching -- being keyed and missing sleep.  Being keyed feels like I'm standing near electricity towers.  I can almost feel a buzzing of current in my body and I have this overwhelming desire to be there for everyone and anyone (solicited or not). My sleep starts to suffer -- I wake up at all hours and can't go back to sleep.  The trigger I can control is sleep.   I'm hyper vigilant about sleeping well every night.  This is one of the reasons for remaining child free.  Recently, I felt that I put too much focus on sleep, making it harder to go back to sleep on rough nights.  My counselor gave me a rule of thumb.  One lousy night is ok, two in a row is a good signal to check in with my therapist or doc.  Wow, the freedom to have a crappy night has been liberating.Better Living Through ChemistryI've been on Lithium since I was diagnosed, yet I still had infrequent manic episodes.  The times that my mania spiraled out of control into psychosis were all before I was introduced to clonazepam five years ago.    I was not sleeping well, stressed, and the tip off for me was that I was paranoid about psychological testing in an MMORPG.  I logged off and told my husband that we had to call my doc immediately.  The on-call doc suggested clonazepam.  I took it for a few days and leveled off.  Since then if I'm keyed up, I take a clonazepam and get some rest.Natural solutions that also help me are meditation and music (Beethoven tops the list).  Above all is my supportive husband who has been there for me for 20 years of this roller coaster. Biggest pet peeve of bipolar life is that nagging feeling whenever I'm feeling blissful.  Hopefully, we can all find our own mix of factors that keep this disorder under control.  Edit: Thank you for letting me share.  It is extremely cathartic; we didn't have the Internet when I was diagnosed.  When I got out of the hospital, I felt very isolated (on top of being an angsty teen).  I still keep my diagnosis private (except for close friends and family).  If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to share my perspective. [info] None [info] 1416641858

I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 while my boyfriend is like a mix between 2 and cyclothymia. We have a habit of slutting it up when we're manic so our relationship is kept open at all times. It's really nice to have someone who I love and know is a good person and he understands all of my different sides. Idk it's awesome! I was really hesitant when we first got together because you don't really hear about people suffering from the same thing living happily ever after...

ishitart [info] Seeing my older brother reminded me of WHY I take my meds (I just need to vent a little) So I (23F) recently went on vacation down to southern state to visit my Dad and family. It had been about 2 years since I last saw anyone and in the 48 hours I spent with my 43 yr old brother confirmed my need to take medication. Both my brother and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and all I can say is that.. I don’t know? He was dealt shitty cards? Or maybe has given up on himself since his diagnosis about 8-10 years ago. He’s completely let himself go, to the point where he came to FAMILY DINNER WITH DRIED FOOD ON HIS JACKET AND CLOTHES UNDERNEATH IT! He was more concerned if I would smoke him out than hanging out with the family or even interacting in general and him and my dad can hardly interact with each other without one of them getting pissed off. He can’t hold down a job (which I understand, it’s hard I really do) lives with his mother and pays no bills. (Can’t keep track of his money obviously) I’m not sure if he takes medication even though he tells everyone he does. Which I honestly feel like is a lie he doesn’t show any improvement in the years he’s been diagnosed. I’m just so sad for him and I don’t know what to do or even if there is anything I CAN do. He used to call me and the conversations would always wander towards bipolar and weed. I felt like he was beginning to use me as his therapist and as a fellow BP person I just couldn’t mentally handle it so I began to not answer as much (I know that’s terrible I’m sorry but I just couldn’t deal). I’m not sure where this post is going other than.. can I do anything? Dad can only do so much without getting REALLY pissed off at him and his mom (half-siblings) doesn’t ever have anything good to say about him. I worry that when his mom gets older I’ll be stuck taking care of him which really isn’t an option for me mentally, unless he gets his shit together even a little. Edit: I do want to add my brother is smart and he used to be VERY motivated and I know he can get that back. He had the ability to get a degree, has moved out before and has been successful. I just don’t want him to give up on himself anymore. [info] None [info] 1547757536

Now yes, I'm a little bit miffed about the fact that god fucking damn it, it feels like it moves me further away from that inner need to be that easy, nice version of normal that I logically know doesn't exist, but as long as I'm dealing with whatever the problem is I'm fine with it.

Nidsan [info] It was an offer from a startup that I was working with remotely. But as startups go, they're not stable and perhaps it might not exist by the time I graduate. It's only an option. The director was talking between the figures of 12-15k since they got funding recently of 30m rm. Then again, you're right that it's just a dream, only ifs that the startup survives then the offer stands. As a consultant with a poly diploma then (4-5 years ago), I was making $2.5k a month.I have about 1 year of experience as a consultant(sometimes remote) which I did while in poly and *within* the 7-month break after poly, 1.5 years in engineering incl intern *( During poly, after poly and + the intern in uni)*. Then here and there toying around in the startup scene remotely during my NS(army) of 2 years till now in uni. I will then continue to work 3 years after I graduate. &gt;If I may ask, why do you want to work in Brunei tho? The benefits/experience in Singapore would be much better.It's the thought of a more calmer life that pulls me out of Singapore. Singapore is a hectic place.

Domidoggy8 [info] One of the issues is that I don't have direct contact with the psychiatrist. I was referred to a psychiatrist back in December but am being told that an appointment is still 4-6 months out. My social worker at my primary care office consults with this psychiatrist once a week. My only other option is to pay out of pocket to go to a private psychiatric facility. It isn't a possibility with my income and I've already paid about $200 in co-pays since the beginning of this month when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I thought I was a bit paranoid when I got an appointment last Thursday for a rash that was only on my legs. The psychiatrist saw photos and said it wasn't Lamictal related. I then proceeded to buy new body wash, detergent, and laundry softener because maybe I was reacting to something else. After it spread Sunday night, I saw my primary care physician yesterday and stopped medication. I feel let down because I thought I was doing well on the medication so far. None of the other Drs. have been able to get in touch with the psychiatrist for medication recommendations since my appointment for the rash yesterday. [info] None [info] 1553712152
Waffles0701 [info] I am bipolar and I’m a hypocrite. So I’m 28 and I was diagnosed with bipolar II ten years ago, you’d think I’d be used to it by now, right?Well after three years of medication, coming off those meds (safely), a few psychologists and training my mind to become hyper aware of my behaviour over the next seven years, I thought I had this shit pegged.I wanted to be that open book, the one you says loud and proud that “this is me! I am a fully functioning adult, I have bipolar and I’m not ashamed to admit it!” For a while, I was.  I was comfortable because I hadn’t relapsed in two years. I was a huge advocate for seeking help for mental health and well being - the self-proclaimed poster child. Well, for those of you playing at home, complacency isn’t the best thing for people like me.I started a new position in a company I have been at for a few years. It was a new team, great boss (who knows about the polar bear in the closet) and a role I knew absolutely nothing about, but that I could sink my teeth into. I was working with people from all around the company who I had worked with before. I thought sure, this is going to be easy! People respect me enough to  be patient with me while I learn.  Idiot.As the year went by, more and more people became dismissive and impatient with me. Mistakes I made were so small and trivial, but the more I made, the bigger the deal got in my head. The relationships I thought that I had with these coworkers had completely changed dynamic. In a classic boiling frog situation, I ended up being more hard on myself than anyone else. I refused to take days off owed to me, telling myself that I didn’t deserve them, that I had to do better. I stopped eating and was in a constant state of nausea.My boss sat me down and told me everything that I needed to hear. He laid out my biggest insecurities on the table, things that are never said out loud in fear that they may be true. That I was rational, that I didn’t need medication, that I was okay. Ever feel like you’ve been stripped completely bare and are vulnerable to the entire world? Same. And what came out of that vulnerability was shame. I was so ashamed for letting myself get this way. For getting to the point where someone felt the need to sit me down and tell me these things. I’m supposed to be the role model for sufferers, and I didn’t even know that I had relapsed and was in a manic state for six weeks. In my complacency I had absolutely no awareness that it was happening. How god damn embarrassing.After that talk, I completely closed up. I shut down, because shutting down was better than feeling vulnerable. The heart that was on my sleeve was tucked deep down inside, the fear of being exposed again all too real.  I eventually picked up the phone and called a psychologist, disgusted with myself that I had to do this. Me? Im the person who had won that battle, I shouldn’t have to do this. I had balance for so. Damn. Long.  And now it’s gone.   I’m now the person that advocates so strongly for seeking help for your mental health, but has such a strong sense of self loathing when she has to do it herself. Hypocrite. [info] None [info] 1549191213

dialogics [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have experienced the shifts in self-confidence like what you describe. It's played out mostly in my career; I can look over my career history and see the peaks and valleys of bipolar influences - professional positions in my field when elevated and hiding-behind-the-scenes labouring jobs when low. It's good to start exploring things now, at a younger age, so that if you do fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum you can address it and potentially ward off or at least minimize the periods of low self-confidence and other effects. I'm 46 and am just now starting to get things under control with medication. Good luck to you and if you can, I'd recommend seeing a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and if warranted, treatment.

_futura [info] faking it? (Sorta long post) OK so this ended up flooding out, sorry. I was diagnosed with bipolar I and I've been feeling pretty stable on a mix of Depakote and Seroquel. But, right now I feel the worst I've felt in a while. I'm at the point where not only am I fighting back tears all the time, but I am constantly thinking about and planning suicide. I have no idea what to do and how to stop myself. There's a rational part of me that's telling me not to, which makes me think I'm faking it somehow subconsciously. I'm just so tired of always feeling this way and I feel even worse for being so damn whiny. At the same time, I feel like I would be in less control of myself if I were actually really bad.

Tsauce70 [info] Hey guys so I was diagnosed with bipolar II last week and given oxcarbazepine to start for treatment. It's an anti-seizure medication called Trileptal that is also prescribed for bipolar. My brief research so far shows it might have some interaction with exemestane, possibly reducing the effectiveness of one or both? I use aromasin as my AI so I'm just curious. Also any interactions with caber? My next blast will likely include NPP and therefore caber. I haven't started the Trileptal yet as I've been waiting to research it fully. I am also curious if Trileptal would have any interactions with recreational substances like MDMA, LSD, or ketamine? I intend on staying away from most everything like that for awhile anyways while I deal with this, but I am curious if I will eventually be able to indulge while still on this medication. Just asking here because I know there's a few of you with some extensive pharmacological knowledge. Thanks guys. [info] tren &amp; molly [info] 1489190753

TheGoodLady [info] I know this comment will probably get buried. But I was diagnosed with bipolar six months ago. I attempted suicide two months ago. I have lost a lot of friends, jobs, and important relationships. It feels like it is never going to get better. I have been thinking about suicide again for the last few days, especially today. My friends all forgot my birthday. There is no one, no support, no love, no purpose. All I have is pain and all I bring other people is pain. I don't think that I can do it any more.  It's good that your Dad found hope, I truly want things to get better for me. [info] None [info] 1451876679

lxlCaraBoolxl [info] For as long as I can remember I have had this habit of picking my nails. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I am on medication for it. I have a job where I count cash to hundreds of people a day and I am so embarrassed at how my fingers have gotten. I wore acrylics from July of last year til October. Took them off for a month and had a relapse into picking. Put acrylics back on November til March and now I am back to doing it. This time it’s progressively worse. Before I was maybe a medium picker but now it’s gotten severe for myself personally. I have gotten to the point that I can ignore the severe pain while bleeding. Everything hurts. Showers hurt, washing hurts, just moving them hurts. On top of my hands are swelling this time from the picking. The one finger I don’t pick doesn’t swell. I do like this Rip-Fix lotion I get on amazon and I prefer not to do acrylics again because working out and lifting weights is hard but ultimately I might have to. Any tips or tricks?

GoodAtExplaining [info] um... You know, I'd like to have an answer that doesn't make me sound bitter, burnt-out or tired, but...I think the fairest way to say it is that I found myself becoming that bitter, burnt-out teacher, and I didn't want to be that. I wanted kids to love the language and be fascinated by it, not subject to the bitter disillusionment of someone who no longer loved what he did.Basically, if you're going to be a teacher, you gotta love what you do - The kids can see it. If you don't love what you do you're not going to make them love it, and we all remember what it was like to learn from a teacher who'd lost their passion. I didn't want to do that, so I left while I still could.About eight years later I was diagnosed with bipolar, so that might've been a reason as well, in fairness. [info] TOR - NHL [info] 1463618811
codemule [info] Can long-term intensive meditation "cure" bipolar? So, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 in 2003. I've had much success managing my symptoms with medication so far. I began meditating in 2015 and logged over 1500 hours of time on the cushion since then. My ability to stay centered and calm is worlds better than before I began meditating. I had been content with managing symptoms, but I'm beginning to consider the possibility of a cure.I've read anecdotal stories of long term insensitive meditators (like 2+ hours a day for 10+ years) who overcame mental illness.Unfortunately I'm having trouble finding more scientific evidence of this. I would imagine that's because there probably haven't been many (or any) studies done like that.I'm not going to be stupid and just stop taking my meds, but I the next time i see my psychiatrist i plan on discussing how to make a long term plan to eventually get off my meds. Has anyone tried doing something similar? Is there anything I might want to talk/ask questions about with my psychiatrist besides just a long term goal?Thanks r/bipolar. [info] None [info] 1546903448

lsmels [info] Hi I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2 and GAD. I take seroquel XR and took it all through my pregnancy and currently while BFing. I was on 200mg but dropped it down to 50mg. I'm also prescribed klonopin as needed but I'm much more leery to take this if I know I'll be feeding soon and I only took it 2 or 3 times during pregnancy. My psych is super conscientious about meds and pregnancy and made me nervous about benzos while breastfeeding. My psych, OB and baby's pediatrician all know about the seroquel and didn't have an issue with it, and I didn't notice any withdrawal symptoms in him after birth. I also used to take lamictal and my psych didn't have any issue with that but did tell me to start taking a folic acid supplement along with my prenatal due to he chance of neural tube defects.

HitomiSenpai [info] I remember that when I was 3 or 4 years old, my mom asked me to go and call my sister for dinner. I went looking into every room, and I opened a dark room, and I could only see the wall being illuminated by the light in the aisle. Suddenly, I saw shadows of someone in a car and getting out of the car with other people and kidnapping a girl. I could even see the girl moving her legs and what the other shadow was covering her mouth and forcing her to go in the car and then they went. They were shadows, on the wall. Then i heard my mom and went back to her. Did not say a word. Up to this date, I don't know what that was...but turns out that some 20 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

TangledUpInAzul [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago. Because of a few factors in my particular case, it was statistically like a doctor telling me, "There's a 90% chance you'll kill yourself before you're 40." In the days that followed the diagnosis, I probably listened to Looking Like You Just Woke Up fifty times. It has, in fact, gotten harder and only slightly easier to hide. It's scary knowing just how steep and potentially short the uphill climb will be for me. That's my lifelong aching.Also, "When I am sad, oh god, I'm sad, but when I'm happy, I am happy," is *painfully* relevant to me. I'm like 95% sure Brian or someone very close to him has bipolar disorder because of how specifically relevant to bipolar disorder many of his lyrics are.  [info] None [info] 1447908719
wyldyflower [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 20. I have mostly depressive swings that last a long time. I also have hypomania swings which isn’t as severe as mania. I’ve been told it’s most likely genetic, my grandpa had it and was treated for it and probably came from his mother. I’ve seen a few different psychiatrists about it and have a pretty good understanding of how my swings go. I have a lot of other side effects that go along with it too. Anxiety insomnia are just a few to mention. Mental health isn’t a joke or something to fake or lie about. I wish it could have gone more into depth in the episode but the episode was about my weight not my brain.  [info] None [info] 1549944842
doct_quinn [info] I agree with this so much.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and PTSD, and it took years for me to accept it.  I went to so many different doctors hoping that everyone was wrong, but all of them kept saying the same thing.  When you actually have a mental illness, chances are when you're first diagnosed you aren't going to immediately accept it and start labeling yourself as that.  I was first diagnosed with PTSD 4 years ago, and only recently told someone other than my mother.  (And that was because I had a minor freakout, and felt the need to kind of explain it.  No one was surprised to find out at all.)  I feel like one of the biggest ways to tell if someone is a self diagnoser is by how quickly they make that label their entire existence.  For me at least, mental illness is only a small facet of who I am. [info] dovah-kin [info] 1377235285
Bowserette [info] Unfortunate that it’s the same policy as for pilots. I earned my PPL at age 19. Later that year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication. I’ll never be able to fly again and that kills me. It was the best experience of my life, and I was looking forward to making it a career. The FAA is slowly starting to accept a couple antidepressants, but certain conditions are permanent disqualification. That also means pilots often self medicate with alcohol to cope. I’d rather have a stable pilot on medication than one who pushes the “8 hours from bottle to throttle” guidelines. [info] None [info] 1558719065
Ktkdjbswoods [info] I need a letter recommending an emotional support animal! Any and all advice/help is much appreciated 💕 Hello beautiful people of Reddit,I’m hoping someone will take pity on me and maybe help. This is going to sound more “woe is me” than I intend so thank you in advance for bearing with me.I’m a college student in IL, US, and just got out of toxic relationship with an emotionally abusive ex who raped me. Over a decade ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, couple years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, and several days ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. That backstory will make more sense in a bit. I’ve been going to therapy and it’s only helping a bit but I got thinking about an emotional support animal. I have no means of earning money and don’t know what my future looks like (with me graduating) so I thought fostering would be the perfect idea. I have all this love in my heart and all this time and will to take care of a cat (I love all animals but my cat—she was part of my family for 15 years—died a few months ago). The place I’m fostering from would pay for the food and litter and everything.Thing is, my apartment building isn’t pet friendly. In order to have any pet, I need to pay hundreds of dollars. But, there would be no charge for an emotional support animal. My lease says, “landlord will authorize a therapy animal or emotional support animal after first receiving a written affidavit from a qualified healthcare professional verifying the tenant’s disability under Section 504 of the Fair Housing Act or relevant provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the need for a therapy animal or emotional support animal.” So basically a letter from a licensed healthcare professional with an official letterhead and signature stating I have a disability and that an emotional support animal is recommended. I realise that requires work and I wouldn’t be asking if I weren’t desperate. My psychiatrist is at the university’s healthcare Center and they have a policy against writing letters for an emotional support animal. My therapist charges $70 for a letter. And rightly so, being a qualified professional requires years of experience and a shit ton of money for tuition. That and it takes time and effort to write a letter. At the moment, I can’t afford it. I can’t even afford therapy or doctor appointments (to figure out why I’m in pain). I talked to my university’s counselling Center and women’s resource Center and no one can write that letter for me. I also checked the official site for registering for an emotional support animal and that also costs money I don’t have.To clarify, there’s this particular cat I want to foster, Molly, and just reading about her filled my heart up with this joy and love that I haven’t felt for a while. While I’d be requesting Molly as an emotional support animal for myself, I am in a place to provide her with a warm and nurturing home until someone adopts her or I move.TL;DRI am a broke college student in need of a letter from a licensed healthcare professional documentation that I have a disability and an emotional support animal (not a service animal) is recommended. If you, or if you know anyone who, would be willing to write that letter for me, please PM me. I can even provide prior documentation. I’ve exhausted all options and I’m hoping this is legal 😅 thank you for reading and hearing me out! [info] None [info] 1587071757
thecalicreole [info] I've messed up... So 3 months ago I was in Los Angeles for about 3 years. Within those 3 years I got depressed and had hypomania. I was doing the usual: unsafe sex with everyone, spending all my money, etc. Turns out I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I went to therapy, learned coping techniques, and was put on Abilify. Everything was going great even though in the beginning, the meds were making me tired all the time. Then one day I felt different after missing sleep and my diet changes. I was very emotional and existential. My mood went to shit. Impulsively I wanted to go back home to New Orleans so I can be around family. So I quit my job, lucky my boss was very understanding and stated I am welcome back, and moved back home. Now I'm here in the worst state for mental health services and with a family that's not understanding of bipolar disorder. My meds are gone and I feel nothing. I feel like I've made a big mistake and want to go back to my real home in Los Angeles. I have a lil bit of a plan to save money after getting a low paying job and move back in either November or December. I also want to start college when I go back (I'm 20 bi male). But how do I stay on track with no access to meds or support? I still talk to my west coast therapist but it's not enough with my meds. [info] None [info] 1439927939

mre5052 [info] personality disorders and emdr I had my first appointment with an emdr therapist today just for the initial consult. The first actual session is next week and even though I’m nervous, I’m hopeful at he same time. I’m just curious if anyone has heard a similar thing from their therapist or has had this experience themselves—she said that the majority of her patients who had bipolar doisorder or borderline prior to emdr and had successful outcomes from the treatment, no longer had diagnoses of personality disorders. She talked about the similarities of BP/BPD traits and the crossover in diagnoses, which I agree with—the traits definitely overlap. I already had suspicions when I was diagnosed with bipolar a little over 3 years ago but the more research I did the more I thought maybe deep down it’s actually borderline. I guess if you’re trying to heal the diagnosis isn’t important. but point being I told her that once I had a manic episode bipolar was clearly the answer. and she said she’s not convinced I’m bipolar bc those episodes could have been a moment where the “bus was hijacked by 10 year old me” or whatever the metaphor was that I’m clearly too cynical to remember yet lol  I’m still going to try emdr but at the same time I just think it’s an oddly bold statement to say that if this worked I could likely come down off of medication bc I wouldn’t be bipolar anymore...like I kind of get what she’s saying, but also wtf?

LeRichard [info] Dude, you're depressed, and I don't mean that in the obvious sense; I mean that in the clinical sense. I too spent some hard years in the closet, and it ended up scarring me also. I finally admitted to myself that I needed to seek help and in the end I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After some treatment, I started feeling much better. I would really recommend it.To address some of the actual things you've talked about, I can't give you advice, because only you know what's best for yourself ultimately, but I can tell you about my own thoughts and experiences. I am a hopeless romantic, but I have never rushed into a relationship and I still have casual sex. In fact, I hold the unorthodox opinion that it's better to make sure you are sexually compatible with someone before trying to connect too deeply on a romantic level. To use an extreme example: Imagine two guys who date for a long time and fall completely in love with each other and then finally they decide to have sex and they find out that they're both total-bottoms. Then everything is complicated--a whole wrench has been thrown in the picture, which could have been avoided. I myself think the societal message that says a lot should be invested in the relationship before having sex is somewhat flawed. Also you very well might be right that losing your top virginity might bring you more confidence. But topping for the first time also requires a good deal of confidence and depressed people have a hard time building up confidence, especially if they have been feeling down for some time. If you're completing PhD studies, I'm sure you're a smart guy, so you may have heard of the "correlation does not equal causation" analysis tool. Don't assume that you're down because you've been having trouble romantically/sexually. Maybe you've (at least partially) been having trouble romantically/sexually because you're so down. Do you really know which one is causing the other? Maybe they're both causing each other. To really sum up what I'm trying to say, first, I really think you need to take care of your mood problems separately from everything else. They are serious and need to be addressed. Second, have you considered just looking for some gay friends, instead of romantic partners? Forget about sex. Forget about love. Forget about top virginity. Just start looking for one or two gay guys that you enjoy talking to, or playing tennis with or something. Join a gay sports league or book club or something. It's win-win: You'll *hopefully* end up losing your top virginity in a locker room with the best sex you've ever had, but if not, then you'll end up with a few new friends, a better sense of self, and higher self-esteem.

LilyChickadee [info] Simple living is embracing the boring and stable I spent my teens and early twenties feeling like I had to do things extreme. Had to travel, hike, live off the grid, consciously living in poverty regardless of my income. Even constantly striving for a “simple life” in unhealthy ways that bordered on obsessionI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and realized I had to change my life drastically. I resisted and mourned the fact that I couldn’t have the things that I had yearned for.But I’ve come to realized the yearning was simply a way to fill some void I had in my life that I couldn’t accept internally. I find happiness in having a stable job, a home, relationship, dog, children in the future. Building up a happy and stable life that I thought was a cop out in my younger years.There’s nothing wrong with being normal. My childhood was chaotic and I am absolutely content having a simple, normal life filled with family and love. I don’t need to live out of a backpack, live without electricity, a phone, internet. I don’t need to backpack the world or gain “experiences” to give myself self-worth. I find happiness in sitting quietly and watching the world go by. [info] None [info] 1558303595
kybp1 [info] My mom is diagnosed with bipolar type 2; I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 1. I was undecided about for three years. I didn't believe in mania, for one. After two years in denial about my ever-worsening manic episodes, I finally decided that whatever is meant by "bipolar type 1" is similar enough to my experience for me to justify trying BP1 treatments. And, lo and behold, lithium brings me out of mania (and the psychosis of peak mania...). Meanwhile, my sister and brother have no bipolar symptoms or diagnoses....  You may not have "bipolar 2," whatever that is. And, as someone with what I consider to be bipolar 1, even I'm *a little* iffy on what "hypomania" looks like. But -- without seeking to convince you to decide in favor of 1) bipolar two's existence or 2) that you have it -- I do vouch for how useful the "bipolar" diagnosis and treatments can be for providing effective solutions to people's health problems. If you're interested and/or haven't done so already, you might lurk around /r/bipolar/. Posts from people unsure about their symptoms or diagnoses are common and welcome.

entombedgosling [info] can anyone relate to this? This would happen even when I wasn't in episodes.  I am diagnosed with bipolar II.  But some people say it sounds more schizophrenic.  I used to have intense fear of paranormal situations.  I was absolutely afraid of ghosts and of being abducted by aliens.  I could not go outside at night, drive at night, or sleep at night.  As soon as I would walk outside I would see images and imagine things, and as soon as that would happen I would have a feeling of complete horror, like something was standing right behind me, and I would constantly look behind my back.  This might not sound bad, but I literally could not sleep until it was light out for fear of being abducted.  I actually hallucinated once and saw the aliens on my back porch and actually called my parents who were able to talk me down.  I have not had a single one of these thoughts now that I am on Risperdal, so it has been at least 1.5 to 2 years, thank god, because they were really scary.  Can anyone relate?Edit:  I also had an auditory hallucination of someone aggressively whistling to get my attention while I was hunting.  I know it wasn't real but it scared me so much I fired a warning shot and was yelling who is there?  No answer.  I ended up crying and running out of the woods.

jeanadhoc [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was given Zoloft for an MDD diagnosis. I entered a manic episode almost immediately. This isn't an uncommon reaction to SSRIs, probably due to an already present imbalance of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, and since Zoloft increases serotonin (and in its specific case, dopamine as well), it's not at all uncommon for Zoloft to antagonize the underlying symptoms of bipolar disorder. I'm not sure how Zoloft reacts with atypical antipsychotics like Abilify, since I haven't taken it without the addition of a mood stabilizer. If you haven't been having any adverse reactions to sertraline (such as hallucinations or common manic symptoms), then it's probably alright. I will say that when I was in the hospital right after my first manic episode, the nurse told me that it's a common joke in the industry that if you want to find out if someone's bipolar, give them an SSRI.&amp;#x200B;I didn't have any real adverse reactions with alcohol and Zoloft, but I only really have two or so drinks when I do drink. However it should be noted that the use of alcohol with psychotropic medications is counteractive to the positive effects of medication. The way it was explained to me is that if you drink while you're taking antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc. then you might as well not take the meds, because the alcohol will negate any positive effects the meds will try to produce. I don't know how true that is or how well I've echoed that, but it's what I got out of it.  Mind that I'm not a medical professional. I've done my homework but everything I say really comes from personal experience and the knowledge I've gained from others. Take it with a grain of salt and trust your psychiatrist; he probably knows more about drug interactions with disorders than I do. [info] Bipolar 1 with Psychotic Features [info] 1546927104

This is what's happening to me. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD since I was young but am not on medication for both because I don't like the effects they have on me. Whenever I'm on a break from school or the weekend I completely shut down. I lay in bed all day and do absolutely nothing. Like I literally just lay there. I don't clean, watch TV, or do my homework. At first I thought it was a depressive episode  or something but when school starts back up I'm better, I'm a normal human but when I don't have anything to do I don't. I mean I could be doing stuff I just can't bring myself to do it. I just lay there tired but I don't sleep. I thought maybe I was anemic because I was vegetarian for 2 years so I bought some iron pills and started eating white meat again. And I'm still like this it's been going on since summer. Could It be from stress? I'm a 4.0 student and work really hard during the week. Also something that started happening recently is that I have really bad shakiness while just laying here. It's kinda like the muscle fatigue you get while working out. It's just everywhere for no reason. Like rn I'm laying down typing this and my arm and one of my legs is shaking. It's taking forever to type this. I just don't know what's happening???? Please help I think I'm sick17, 5'1 160 female [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1577099408
ABraThatMeows [info] I'm So Conflicted... Hey! New here...So a little boring back-story: Growing up I was always made fun of for being fat, so when i was about 14 I started a cycle of not eating/binge eating and lost 40lbs. I'm still at that weight (135), which is much healthier than the fat weight. I still binge eat quite frequently and I've been diagnosed with bipolar which doesn't help all my body issuesMy problem is, I love the way curves look on other women. A curvy body type is my ideal--and i don't just mean boobs and a butt. I just think it's a lot prettier. I have no boobs, and I'm 5'6" at 135 and look pretty skinny. You can see my ribs at my chest when I stretch a little. I want the curvy body type but every time I get a little chubbier,I freak out because of all the bullying I went throughI'm just unsure of which direction to turn in. Should I just accept being skinnier or allow myself to gain a bit of weight? (The binge eating has to go, i know)I'm not sure if this is even what this sub is for but I thought this'd be the place for it... [info] None [info] 1368760327

jamide [info] Ashamed of How I Acted While Manic A bit of background, I grew up in a small southern town. I graduated in the top 10% of my class with honors and multiple music awards. My mother is bipolar, but I did not know this until after my diagnosis. My best friend and I got accepted to the same college and we decided to be roommates. I had to go to school before her for band camp and I had a lot of fun. By the time she got there, according to her and my parents, I was acting a little strange. I have few memories of this time, but I know I was staying out late, putting myself in risky situations, and lying to my family and friends. The situation escalated until I finally met a guy who convinced me to try K2. I had a bad experience and ended up going home with my parents. I subsequently went to two different emergency rooms. At this point I was pretty delusional. Now comes the part I'm most ashamed of. I had some bruises on my thighs and I truly believed that the guy that gave me the k2 raped me. He didn't. But that didn't stop me from telling everyone that I knew at school that he did and that they should stay away from him. I was hospitalized for about a week, and I wasn't right for about two weeks after that. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on meds. I knew at that point I'd had a manic episode. I returned to school, but after my very first class, I was hit by a taxi cab in a crosswalk and I had to drop out because I couldn't get to class on crutches. It's been about six months and I've been volunteering and going to church. I'm not sure when I'll be able to return to school, but sometimes I'm not even sure if I want to go back after the ass I made of myself. I really struggle with feeling ashamed of what I did and how I hurt my family and friends. [info] None [info] 1397939674
cubicularis [info] I’m selfish and I need help I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was around 16. I’m on antidepressants, I go to therapy, but I still have bad days. Recently my dad was diagnosed with Stage 2 colon cancer and today he started chemo therapy. I was supposed to stay home and look after him while my mom went to work but I left to go get high. I come back and my mom is pissed at me, as she should, and she starts going off on me. I, drugged up and feeling invincible, tell her I didn’t ask for any of this and run upstairs. I immediately feel disgusting and want to apologize but I know what I did is so so shitty I don’t even know how. I have had substance abuse issues in the past and when my grandfather passed away 2 years ago, instead of spending as much time with him as I could I went out partying and drinking. I don’t want to repeat the same patterns and I am so fucking ashamed of how I have treated my family. I get upset when any minor inconvenience happens and I blame it on my mental illness.

dnr-u [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 ten years ago. I recently procured some bud after hand surgery. My supply of morphine and codeine had run out and the pain was pretty intense. Five minutes after smoking a tiny bowl I fell into a state of suicidal despair which lasted about four hours. Full blown existential terror. I woke the next morning feeling relaxed and refreshed. I slept until noon and even dozed off in the afternoon in my armchair which is something I have never done before. I could contently read a book without losing patience or my mind wandering. I know that the cannabis for sale on the street is far too strong for casual users and can cause problems for sensitive users but the residual effects for me anyway seem to be a lot more therapeutic that the atypical antipsychotics that UK doctors prescribe. I know that with the right research and dosage weed could be the answer to the suffering of millions of people.  [info] None [info] 1541083662

pikupr [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and bpd! Definitely possible. It's very frustrating, though proper management helps. Sometimes splitting can look like hypomania, but I've learned to tell the difference. One of the big ones is that the bipolar symptoms are generally apropro of nothing (unlike most bpd symptoms which are triggered) , and self comfort does not calm me down (whereas it can be easier to deal with during bpd symptoms). Definitely talk to your pdoc about it!  [info] None [info] 1507166233

EmilyKaldwins [info] Sorry, I'm not quite sure what TTC means?My main priority was to ease my symptoms and thus hoping to have the cause and effect of helping the weight come off easier because everything's connected. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but through research and understanding more, there is a very, very VERY good chance that my bipolar symptoms are actually caused by my PCOS (mainly the highs and lows and the extreme mood swings).I tried doing my own Inositol first but was too anxious/frustrated about trying to get the dose right on my own. I hated taking metformin and how it made me feel and that's how I ended up looking for alternatives.I guess Right off the bat my cycle started to regulate. Before I'd be skipping periods (honestly no complaints there) or go on for a full seven-eight days. On Ovasitol, my period would be about three-four days with spotting through a couple days after. I also had issues with thick uterine lining and this went away too. In order to make my ovasitol last (because it's pricey) I was only doing 1 packet a day and had those effects.In addition, I noticed my mood swings weren't as bad. They would center primarily in the week before my period, not through the entire month like they used to. I had more good days than bad.Blood sugar wise, well, I wasn't monitoring my diet very closely but I noticed that my spikes and drops weren't as bad either.I do have some obnoxious facial hair on either side of my chin that I try to pluck and didn't notice too much of a difference HOWEVER I was not specifically targeting that issue. Inositol supplements are not a All Over Curative. This focused mainly on my ovarian health.Once I ran out of supplement (and honestly like I was still really bad at taking it. I would forget some days) My period became a nightmare. In November it started normally and it was heavy, there was a ton of clotting, and it lasted for 20 days. The same thing happened in December.Inositol didn't make me sick, give me diarrhea, headaches, make me sleepy, make my stomach hurt like metformin. I tried metformin. I tried so hard and slowly tried to build myself up to it but I could never do anything with the side effects I experianced and I really wanted to get off pills.In addition to Ovasitol 2x, I'm taking 500mg of magnesium, 6000IUs of D-3, a women's multi-vitamin, fish oil, B-complex and now I'm starting Saw Palmetto which targets will target the excessive 5-alpha reductase. What that does is it's converting my overproduction of testosterone into DHT. Don't want that. So this should hopefully target the hirsutism and basically hair issues. Making sure you're getting your B-vitmains should help balance the fact that Biotin is in everything for women. I also plan on starting collagen peptides in Feb.I hope this helps???

Korinney [info] - Coop advisors can be useless, coop offerings can be shit, coop isn't guaranteed to be paid (or even paid hourly) so you can end up in debt for that time as well.- Very small sense of real community. The campus is scattered and because of coop cycles, you really have to work to make friendships and relationships last.- Because on-campus housing is so expensive and near-campus housing is insane, commuting becomes a reality for many students very quickly. I moved off campus after my second year and immediately felt like I was going to a different school. Hell, even when I was living in Davenport B and didn't have a meal plan I felt like I was in a different school. (Can be solved by not moving off of central campus and keeping a meal plan.)- Shuffle shuffle shuffle. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder through UHCS and went on medical leave for two months. Came back part-time and struggled endlessly (in therapy and on medication from an outside psychiatrist regularly). Two YEARS later I've been told that I was supposed to have been given an advisor at the Disability Resource Center to help me with school. YEARS, PEOPLE. No one told me it was something I should use/could use.- School is really run as a company/brand. I don't feel like the administration wants me to learn, I feel like they treat me like an incoming check. I don't feel valued as a student, encouraged to learn, because my classes (STILL! AS A SENIOR!) are all medium-sized to large and so I can't get to know my professor easily. Even if I make the effort to go to office hours, they still have tons of students.- University relies heavily on adjunct professors which it doesn't value or treat well. Ditto graduate students/post-grads who are instructors. [info] CSSH [info] 1416532508
DisturbedLee [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar as a kid and more recently, last six years or so, bipolar with psychosis. So I mostly have psychosis episodes while in a bipolar episode but sometimes out side of them as well.  I'd been on different meds for various mental issues since a was a young child. I know they work and can be very helpful. I personally don't like to take medicine anymore though for various reasons. I like to learn about the issues and how they work and how people deal with them, and that helps me understand it better and be in more control of it. One thing I really need to work on is that sleep routine. It's a mess, but I have a hard time going to sleep sometimes and other times I have a hard time waking up. Meditation used to help really well. I'd meditate for 10-15 minutes before bed then listen to a sleep story and be out in minutes. It doesn't work so well anymore. Eating better is one thing everyone tells me I need to do. And I would if I could, but I just can't afford it. If I eat, I eat as cheap as possible most of the time. I eat one meal at the end of the day, or if food is low I'll eat once every couple of days. So that is a pretty big problem, but I've done this for so long it's just become normal for me and I forget it's a problem. I'm at the point I don't desire food until it's in front of me. I'll work on my sleeping habits, try to get back in control of that. I'll probably get back into a meditation routine as well to help. The eating situation will have to stay as it is for now.

Giddy_pig [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar (not so sure about the validity of that now but anyway) when i was about 20 but leading up to that, life was a bit rough. Around 18 years old i developed quite aggressive plaque psoriasis. I was on and off several SSRIs during this time. Stress was a factor too.I feel like the mental duress and it's affects on the immune system were likely factors that also required SSRIs treatment. In other words there might be a correlation but the link is the stress.This is all just spit balling though, I'm definitely qualified to make such statements. [info] None [info] 1518258400
oblbious [info] Comfort in bad habits Apologies in advance for spelling mistakes and format. I’m impulsively sharing via phone. I am having a hard time getting the courage to write out how much I find comfort in my bad coping mechanisms and impulsive habits.. I am diagnosed with bipolar, ptsd, and bpd. When things out of my control happen and change my life I take that as a “fuck it do what you want” card. I’m currently on week two of a mixed episode and I’ve successfully pushed all healthy people out of my life because it doesn’t feel right. I don’t deserve understanding or love. I don’t even know who I am and have to force my understanding caring personality for the people showing me love and care.. I just don’t have the energy for it. Since I’ve been free of trying to be a good person to a human who fell I love with me I’ve gladly been over spending on alcohol and having sex with men who I don’t have a connection with. It feels nice and comforting to be a sex object with someone I know won’t try to give a fuck about me..  Also still recovering from an awful cover narcissist engagement so any sense of identity I had when I was with that demon is gone and I have to find myself again... Uhg My bank account and my impulsive sexual choices are obviously for the millionth time hurting my ability to grow. I don’t feel like growing. The FUCK IT personality I get when I’m like this is like a drug. Does anyone else do this? I use to have a blog for my mental health rambles I’m afraid of sharing due to judgment but I manically deleted it two years ago and haven’t had the fucking courage to share my bullshit with the internet since.. I’ve chosen to isolate for now since I don’t want to fuck uo or be the me family and friends want. [info] None [info] 1559437830

rileymonxx [info] Advice - feeling like a complete loser For reference, I'm a 21 year old female. Lately I've been doing a lot of self-reflection and I don't like what I'm seeing. Though I've had a few close friends throughout the years, I've never really felt like part of a large group or community--and I'm realizing that has a lot to do with how I present myself. I'm kind of weird and I don't really take good care of myself. Just for extra info, I've been diagnosed with bipolar II (although a part of me still finds it difficult to believe that's a "real thing.") Anyway, it's just dawning on me how people have probably perceived me, in many different parts of my life, and really hurting me. I know I should use this as motivation to make positive changes but it's difficult to not just let it drag me down. It's starting to make sense why I've been ignored in multiple contexts, why people have made rude or offhanded comments at different points in my life, why I wasn't invited to certain parties. I don't fit in and I'm very ashamed of that. I need to have better hygiene (it's not abysmal but I'm realizing I've been very lazy about it). I'm not sure how to conceptualize this all so I guess that's essentially what I'm looking for help with.Thanks for reading this word vomit. [info] None [info] 1480862472
CaseyAlyssa [info] Mental Illness &amp; Catholicism I was raised Catholic. I've had the four "standard" early-life type sacraments. I'm now 22 and in graduate school. I was raised by a faithful mother, who goes to Mass nearly weekly, and a father who goes when we drag him. I've had a very on-again-off-again relationship with my faith, and that's been exacerbated recently by some struggles with mental illness.I was diagnosed with bipolar ii in March of 2012 and borderline personality disorder in August of 2013. I was hospitalized in April 2013 for suicidal ideation/gestures.I struggle to rationalize why a loving God would make me suffer so very much. Why He would make my day to day existence such a struggle. Why I would be drawn to what is clearly a mortal sin with seemingly no outside influence.When I first got to college (fall 2009), I leaned very strongly on my faith to get me through some hard times. My mental health was much better at that point. As my mental health has deteriorated, my religious life has suffered. I don't like feeling adrift, feeling purposeless, and feeling so freaking lost all of the time. I know that, in faith, I have conquered many of these feelings in the past. So I guess what I'm looking for is suggestions. Books to read, websites to peruse, prayers to try...What I'm not looking for is empty platitudes. Unless it's part of a comment that contains actionable suggestions, I don't want to hear that I should "trust God's plan." I'm sorry if that comes off as harsh, but it is what it is.TL;DR: Diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, struggle with suicide, trying to get back into some sort of faith life.

skeletonsmama [info] When does Hypomania become Mania? Can anyone help me ID if the line has been crossed? So, have been experiencing what I put down as a hypomanic episode for nearing a month. I am diagnosed with bipolar  II and within memory can only really identify hypo episodes - but my memory prior to 2019 is pretty fucked and I went through a lot of SSRIs and stuff prior to diagnosis.I have also - seperately because of bipolar II and the psychiatrists reasoning - been diagnosed with pyschosis that exists independent from my mood and recently started on anti-psychotics. The reason I'm asking this is the Hypomania hadn't really slowed. I chewed through 4 2mg diazapam - usually 2 of those knock me out but within an hour these had stopped having any effect. I'm going from idea to idea to idea, I want to spend a lot of money I don't have (and already have done), I'm loosing all impulse control and having a hard, if not impossible time physically leaving the house by myself. I'm going to talk to a doctor about all this, I have an appointment Thursday, just any resources online are super unclear as where the line is between mania and Hypomania and if someone's experienced both and could help me distinguish? And I ask because this is worse than I have experienced before. So I am unsure if it's just Hypomania like I haven't experience before or could be mania and thus indicative of other things.

Sarahkubar [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 15 (by a regular GP, who I later found out didn't have the experience or education to even diagnose or prescribe anything for those types of issues) and put on some heavy medication. I took myself off it as I couldn't function at school and it was damn near impossible to wake up of a morning. When I was around 16 and a half I did some googling in photography class one morning and stumbled across Borderline Personality Disorder. The symptoms were so identical with mine and resonated so much within me that I printed the info out and held onto it. Few months later I went and saw a psychiatrist for the first time for an official diagnosis. Low and behold, she diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. I'm much better now, on adequate medication, and can handle myself and my thoughts much easier. Google *can* help.  [info] None [info] 1494264994

It all actually started when I took lexapro a year ago which caused me to start rapid cycling. I always thought it was a coincidence and that the tinnitus was related to my TMJ.

Jizzanthapuss [info] New here. Bipolar but not a major alcoholic. I was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder which really makes the majority of my life make sense. Liquor has always been a factor in my mood swings, and for that reason I quit drinking about 2 months ago. But now I'm really craving a beer. Now I have a friend who's an alcoholic, and he CANNOT have a single beer and call it a night... But that is something I have always had no problems doing. I rarely would binge drink and even when I did, it only pushed me into a manic episode half of the time (Which is the big concern here) Now the problem is that even a single beer has the potential to push me into a manic episode. Even thought the effects of the alcohol have hardly taken place, it might be enough to make me hypo manic. This is what scares me and what made me quit drinking in the first place. But to be honest, it would be worth it to me to have a beer with a nice dinner and go home and sleep, even if I risked the mania. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Thanks for reading.

c_c-baxter [info] Psychosis when Manic Hey,I was just diagnosed with bipolar and had some questions. I went to my doctor initially because I thought I had schizophrenia. After a while, they said that I've been diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features. I dont know that I agree with their assessment from what they say my symptoms should be, particularly the mania. I dont think I have ever experienced mania but I definitely had psychosis.Does anyone have experience where ones mania is just psychotic thinking? I dont think I experienced an elevated mood or any of the typical symptoms and my first bout with psychosis is what led to this diagnosis. Side note: I dont think I'm getting adequate treatment and will be looking for a new doctor soon. Thank you! [info] None [info] 1586540667
Jake_The_Scrub_Lord [info] I recently got diagnosed with bipolar 2 after having a hypomanic episode a couple weeks ago. Don’t know if it’s real or not. So, recently (2 weeks ago) I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 after having a hypomanic episode where I pretty much stayed up for 4 days straight. So cut to now. I think I’m having another episode but I don’t have anyone to ask except you guys. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything beyond eat, watch videos on my phone, and lay in bed. But I have been less able to sleep for the past two days. Although I can’t sleep, I don’t have the motivation for anything beyond laying in my bed. I don’t feel depressed, I feel lazy beyond hell, but I can’t sleep even though I’ve been trying for days. I have been unable to nap (which I usually do) and my sleep has been lessening over the past few days. Last night I slept like 4 hours, and the night before 6 with no naps during the day. I’ve been trying to sleep but it’s impossible. Idk if I’m just having bad insomnia or if another hypomanic episode is coming and I need to watch out or tell my psychiatrist.

brilliantlycrazy86 [info] Sometimes I feel like I don't fit in! I'm sure the title is something that most bipolar people feel but I don't feel like I fit in anywhere sometimes.  A little back story I was adopted when I was little and later found out that my biological father had some real issues (message me if you want to know).  I knew my biological mother was nuts (yes I said it!) but I didn't know with what, also I lived with her for 6 years before I was adopted.  Later in life I found out she was bipolar or manic-depressive at that time.  Anyway from about 14 on I was always a moody or emotional kid, but my family was super religious so I was told to pray about it, and I was told by doctors it was just puberty.  I also knew how to hide my symptoms growing up so it wasn't until college I was diagnosed.  My freshman year of college I was diagnosed with bipolar and I had to go to the student health center (parents being religious) and never had a steady doctor.  I did somethings on my mania I am lucky I'm still here but I was never hospitalized.  I was able to manage graduating college, getting 2 career level jobs, I am buying a house, and trying to have a baby.  I am a successful bipolar which is great but sometimes I don't feel like I fit into the "bipolar" world because I have never been hospitalized and on the same sense I don't feel like I fit into the "normal" world because of my illness.  It sucks sometimes because when I try to talk to other bipolar people I have been told I don't understand because I don't have it that bad. BUT I do have it that bad I have just spend many many years learning how to hide (not healthy) and push through it.  HOLY MOLY: Thank you everyone for all the support I needed to hear it.  Sometimes it is so hard because I want to be open about being bipolar but I don't want the stigma.  LOVE YOU GUYS AND GALS!Does anyone else feel this way or am I just being "crazy" [info] None [info] 1334893220
sammywol [info] Questioning my diagnosis (long post) Please bear with me, I'm new to reddit.So, I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since I was 8 or 9 (I'm now 22), I was rediagnosed when I was 12. I've never talked about my disorder. My mother, who also has bipolar, always taught me to keep it a secret and never really talk about it in public, only to a therapist.About a year ago, a friend of mine who has PTSD and Depression "came out" to me about her PTSD and Depression, this gave me the courage and power to "come out" about my bipolar. It also encouraged me to start researching the disorder.As I've researched bipolar, I feel as though I meet some of the symptoms, and others I don't. I don't seem to have defined manic and depressive episodes, so I've chalked it up to mixed states. However, I seem to be manic a lot more than depressive.All of this research has caused me to start questioning my disorder. I will sometimes find things that fit, and it will be a reassurance that I am not wrong, and other times I will find things that don't fit, and I will feel like I don't have bipolar.It actually scares me to think that I might not have bipolar. It's taken me 10 years to get to this point, what if I don't have bipolar, and I have something else?I'm trying to find a way to get a physiological evaluation done, I'm a college student and the cost is too much for me.Any thoughts would be great! Thanks all! [info] None [info] 1448949452
calcoteivy97 [info] New Relationship So I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after being hospitalized for a suicide attempt. That was in July 2018. I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship January 2018, and went into mania for a few months... lots of partying, tattoos, spending, etc. Then I hit rock bottom. I was living alone, and working 3 jobs in order to support myself. Anyways in September, I met this amazing guy... absolutely perfect. I’m 21 and he’s 30 (large age gap, I know). I was honest with him from the beginning, and told him I was bipolar. He’s been extremely supportive. We became exclusive in November. I was head over heels for him and the happiest I’ve ever been, until recently. Something in my mind is telling me that I don’t deserve to be happy, that he doesn’t deserve to deal with this, and that I need to break it off to avoid heartbreak on both ends. I’ve felt extremely alone, even though he’s introduced me to his friend group and accepted me as one of them. His friends even told me “not to ruin it” because we are the perfect match for each other and he’s the happiest he’s ever been. I’m struggling with keeping myself together. I don’t want him to know I’m going through this struggle. Last night I messaged him and told him that if at any point that he was compromising his own happiness to try and make me happy, to not be afraid of hurting me and break it off. I really upset him by saying that. I struggle with keeping myself from saying things I don’t necessarily mean but my head is saying. I’m literally tearing myself to pieces trying to keep myself from breaking it off, because I know this is a depressive episode and I’ll regret it later. [info] None [info] 1548807566
angelface10 [info] Wtf am I supposed to name something like this So I don’t usually post on these things because I’m scared...but i see a lot of people posting and sharing things so I’m going to give this a try.I feel like such an annoyance and burden to everybody around me. I’m so annoying and emotional. I realize that my mood changes super quickly. I’m happy one min and then the next I’m so angry and I’m saying really mean things to people that I regret a couple hours later and i can’t help or control what I’m doing. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I feel like I will never be able to hold down a stable relationship of any kind because I am not stable and I don’t know if I will ever be.  Regardless of the medication I take or how many counselors I talk to. I feel like I’m going to be stuck in this circle for the rest of my life of not controlling myself. I’m either really high on life and happy or I’m sad and depressed or angry. It’s so strange...I can feel and detect when I’m on a high...but I also have the voice in the back of my head telling me It won’t last. I  don’t know how long I can keep fighting for guys... After years of trying to cope with this..I can tell you right off the bat that it fucks you up in ways you don’t even realize. I’m exhausted and I’m tired. I would give up anything to go through one day without feeling like I’m on a roller coaster every second of the day. I want to be free. I want to be normal but for some reason I can’t get a grasp on reality and it’s slowly killing me, just like it killed my dad. [info] None [info] 1537343927
Kellebelle0127 [info] "You're not helping yourself" Sorry if this is against the rules -- new poster. I found out I had borderline when I moved out to go to college last September. I was away from my boyfriend and my family and was basically all alone all the time. I ended up dropping out after 3 weeks because I got so depressed it was unbearable. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few months before that, and my psychiatrist at the time told me I wasn't ready to move out, I ignored her. She was right. Now every night I have to have my boyfriend sit with me until I fall asleep every night, my best friend got married and moved away so I'm a mess constantly (shes pregnant now and sleeping a lot so we dont talk a lot which makes me feel rejected) and whenever people leave the house or are too busy to be with me I cry. I dont mean to be emotionally manipulative. I'm afraid of how attached I am to people. I never used to be like this, I think moving out brought it out. Now I do online school and sleep most of the day and never leave the house. My family, therapist and pdoc tell me I'm doing it to myself. I don't know what to do to help myself.  This is so new to me.  I've been depressed before, but never like this. [info] None [info] 1519007622
JustAnotherLemonTree [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I spiked many, many phones in fits of rage.

Kindheartedspirit [info] I lived with my mom for 18 years of my life and during the last 6-7 years of my stay with her, it was awful. *I* diagnosed my bipolar disorder at 16 years old. When I was 17, my mom tried to get me to do Confirmation(a Catholic thing for those who don't know) and I told her I didn't want to because I didn't believe in God. Of course this led to fights with her. I even went to question my Confirmation teacher during my first year with him because f*** it's not worth my time and there's logically unsound ideas in Catholicism that I kept pointing out. When he finally was fed up with me, I stopped attending only to have to go *back* because my mom kept giving my stepdad crap about it so he asked me to do it for my mom who he later said she is sick in the head (said this in Vietnamese so it's the best translation). I thought it was unfair that I had to do this for her because she stopped being a good mom to me after she had my sisters *who happen to be my stepdad's kids with her*. But my diagnosis of her came out to be pretty accurate because lo and behold, here I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 (which I never thought would be the case until I kept spending lots of money on things I wanted and racking up credit card debts) and the only person I could have reasonably get it from is her. So what you said is *entirely not fair*. There's no reason for you to have to sacrifice your freedom when there's a car *right there* not being used. You're not taking her freedom away because if she wanted to go out, walking suffices. [info] None [info] 1569346301
housewifeonfridays [info] A long time ago I was diagnosed with bipolar and the therapist thought I was self-medicating with weed.

Chibi347 [info] I can totally relate. My older sister (by 6 years) has epilepsy. I remember having the same thoughts of wanting to have my physical injuries being more than they were. I know now that I was just craving more attention, mostly from my father. My family is great but I wanted to be “special” too. I obviously didn’t understand the severity of my sisters condition. I got what I wanted a year ago when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I definitely always want to be mentally okay but sometimes I think about if I broke my leg it would give me an excusable chance to just, slooooow dooooown.

Darkntwisty11 [info] It's finally happening you guys! I've lived in Southern California all my life, and I was diagnosed with bipolar II shortly after I turned 18. I've been having a lot of trouble finding my footing because frankly, my support system just didn't understand what I was going through. The first three years after diagnosis were a massive disaster, and the next two were all about picking up the pieces. And now that I'm turning 23 in a few days, I've probably made the biggest decision I've made in my life so far...I've been wanting to make a change in my life, and though it scares the living shit out of me, I'm finally making that change. As of September of 2014, I will be living in Oregon, continuing my education and starting fresh. [info] None [info] 1398744528

47620590 [info] Possible negative trigger aheadI'm not doing too well. Me and my gf of three years broke up on valentines day because my illnesses finally wore her down. I already always feel guilty but she said some stuff that really drove that home. I tried to go out to be with friends this weekend but I ended up getting a really bad fever and possibly tonsillitis so I had to take a four hour train ride back home by myself. I don't know if I can bring up other illnesses here but my OCD has been worsening recently and the lamictal I've been taking for two months now isn't doing anything for me. I'm a complete mess and I don't have anyone in my life who understands what I'm going through.My mom tells me that there are worse things to have than OCD and got angry when I told her I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My ex was the only beacon of support I had and I know she'll be better off without me so that doesn't help at all either. I constantly feel like no one I know actually likes me which puts strains on relationships with family/friends and ruined the one with my gf.I recently started giving in to my compulsions of smashing my head against walls/doors and it brings some relief because even though I know it's not right, I feel like I deserve it. I fucking hate myself and I'm getting really tired of being alive.Thanks for posting this, I've had to keep all of that to myself for a while and seeing it all in front of me made my problems feel valid, something I struggle with because of my mom. I'm really sorry for ranting and I hope this doesn't bring anyone down. [info] None [info] 1518968654

fellhound007 [info] I have nightmares when I'm awake and I feel no one takes me seriously. Im 23 years old. Around 2009-2010 I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. That alone was hard enough. But I had a fairly abusive childhood and things started getting worse family wise, I dont even know where to start. 2011 my dad attacked me. And my family brushed it under the rug. Every day I see the scar. Everyday I think of it. Ive always struggled, but I guess Im too good at hiding it because friends and family just brush me off. 2018 I was finally diagnosed with PTSD, but that was after seeing my husband attempt suicide twice,a severe car accident, and being in such a bad place, on top of the trauma already there. I snapped last month. I couldnt do it anymore. I quit my job. I dont sleep. I have nightmares. Im constantly angry and yelling and I dont know how to stop. Im just this aggressive mess and its like nightmares while Im awake. Vivid flashes in my head and I just stop and the world goes silent. I am in therapy, but my thoughts are so jumbled that its like word vomit and i cant focus. And i constantlt downplay and laugh like im ok and im not and i dont know how to stop. I dont know how to tell my friends. My husband although also has PTSD has it for different reasons (army vet) and doesn't understand. Im so frustrated and lost. I cant get out of my head.

trout2243 [info] I have a couple of questions for all you bipolar people out there  Now, I don't know anybody else that has bipolar so I've never asked these questions:So, I was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago. I was hospitalized 3 times within the course of 5 months. They had me on all kinds of meds that didn't work, but eventually got me on the right ones. Anyway, my question is: While I was either off my meds or on the wrong ones I sometimes felt like I was trapped in my own body. Do other people with bipolar feel the same way sometimes??Second question:I can't usually feel when I get into a mood or whatever, but while I'm in a mood I often talk to myself in my head and try to talk myself out of doing stupid shit. Like today, I told my girlfriend to tell me things that would make me jealous. I kept telling myself that it was a bad idea but some other part of me was like "do it because you really want to get mad right now." Do any of you guys do that? [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1413211704

danullment [info] Intro to my MIL who tried to bribe DH to leave me Another user posted a story about her MIL trying to bribe her FDH to leave her. Seeing her story made me finally feel ready (after lurking on this sub for over a year) to share my story. I will share the story of the bribe soon, but I wanted to start by giving you some background. She is mostly BEC, though she has veered into Just No territory, obviously, with the whole bribe thing. Some background info: I am polyamorous. I have my legal DH1 of 11 years and my unofficial DH2 who I’ve known for 8 years, almost 4 of them spent in a relationship. The three of us live together and are very happy and have a pretty great family dynamic. The guys aren’t involved romantically but are absolutely best friends. My family knows we are poly and don’t care but DH1’s family disowned him when he told them about us and it devastated him. We have not told DH2’s family we are poly for this reason. The story we gave them was that DH1 and I are no longer together romantically but that we are still living together because he has a disability (true) and DH2 and I love him and want to take care of him forever (also true.) Most of DH2’s family has been pretty okay with that explanation and treat DH1 as an unofficial member of the family. Besides the random interrogations from MIL2 about when DH1 and I would “finally” get divorced, the poly situation hasn’t really been an issue. (That I’m aware of…it’s very possible that the family suspects we are actually poly but that hasn’t really affected anything.) The BEC things MIL2 has done include: -Telling me (like 4 months into my relationship with her son) that she knew I had “emotional issues” from the day she first met me. This was said during a family vacation where she took me aside for like an hour long “heart to heart” where she interrogated me about why I still live with DH, my family history, and my mental health (I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder and PTSD from being sexually assaulted). She acted like she was really kind and caring during that conversation but that comment (and the fact that she knew nothing about me besides what I looked like at that point) really pissed me off. I’m 98% sure that judgment was based off of my many tattoos and piercings and the fact that I’m goth/metal af. I’ve been medicated for over a decade and manage my mental health quite well. -Insists on pointing out that I’m “white too” whenever I mention my Native heritage. I’m equal parts Native and white but I was raised by my grandmother who is Native and have always identified as Native. I feel like she constantly has to mention that I’m also white to make her feel better about the fact that I’m with her son. Because literally all of this woman’s friends and family are white, anti-immigrant, pro-Trump. I’m pretty much the only “liberal” and POC at any family gathering. -Is totally unaccepting of different people and religions. She cries because DH2 is an atheist and is going to hell. She cried and became very upset when he mentioned casually (I was not present at the time) I was very close friends with a Muslim. She literally thinks all Muslims are evil people. -Gossiping and spreading false stories about me to the family based on hearsay from other family members and refusing to acknowledge when she is wrong or apologize for making me look bad. -Acting like she absolutely loves and adores me while actively trying to turn DH2 against me. I was able to ignore/write off most of the BEC stuff because she can be very kind and charming is very good at hiding her true feelings. That’s why it took me so long to realize she hated me and wanted me gone. Next time, the story of how she tried to break us up and DH2 had to learn to shine his spine. [info] None [info] 1541789771

zero-01 [info] I have some questions. So I have been diagnosed with bipolar for a few months now. That was my first time going to a doctor for "mental help" because I was taught that mental health is some fancy excuse for the rich/upper class and it's just your perception that needs to change. Nevertheless I always kindnof knew something was wrong with me and I am still so conflicted about everything. I am 80% sure I may have schizophrenia. A few rare times I've had visual hallucinations. I have voices in my head which I interpret as like 3-4 me just arguing with each other, if that makes sense? I loved my first old therapist. She listened to me and at the very least gave a shit about me. But my new counselor is just so, horrible. He actually made my life worse. He sometimes fall asleep during our sessions and then jokes about it and brushes it aside. I specifically told him not to tell my parents anything other than that I have bipolar and he actually spilled every major fucking details that we discussed. I am very non-confrontal guy and don't know how to get out of that clinic. And during this whole time, my symptoms have worsen and I am not sure if it's just early sign of schizophrenia or just my bipolar. Can anyone help me understanding these symptoms? Also what's the best way to get myself out of that clinic? Sorry for the long post. It's just I don't know what else to do. [info] None [info] 1514864340
BoojiBoy [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her behavior definitely reminds me of some of my more unhinged moments before I started taking medication.  When that kind of thing used to happen to me, it would feel literally impossible to understand my thoughts and emotions.. much less control them.  When you add a couple of high pressure situations into the mix like running a kitchen by yourself and doing it in front of cameras for a prime-time television audience, it's inevitable that it all snowballs into a meltdown.  It's happened to me quite a few times, unfortunately.  That said, there's a definite layer of "total bitch" in her attitude that seems to be independent of the other thing.Maybe with all of the negative attention, she'll realize that she needs to get help and she may come out of the experience a better person.  I hope so, anyway.  I don't like seeing people suffer in that way.  It hits way too close to home.As far as the husband is concerned, I have no clue what his problem is.  He just kind of seems like a plain old dick. [info] None [info] 1368609069

frustrated54321 [info] 32 weeks pregnant and going through withdrawal because PDoc was too disorganized to give me a refill on my meds As mentioned in the title, my PDoc (and pharmacy) was too disorganized to give me a refill on my meds. I’m 32 weeks pregnant so I can only imagine the impact this is having on the baby. I was diagnosed with bipolar2 in pregnancy and put on Lamotrigine. I noticed I was running low last Thursday and asked my pharmacy to fax a renewal request to my PDoc. Monday rolls around and the pharmacy says it was sent back to them saying they had the wrong number. I confirmed the number with the PDoc office and told them I am out of meds, so my pharmacy would be faxing over a renewal request. I called several times today, left messages at the PDoc’s office asking them if they could renew the medication and letting them know I’m having symptoms of withdrawal (shakes, nausea, lightheadedness). I got my pharmacy to fax another “urgent” request for a refill, and still nothing. I’m so frustrated and it feels like at this point my only option is to go to emergency where I’ll be treated like garbage because they don’t think it’s their job to refill medications. I’m so pissed. Why would the doctor put me on this medication in the first place to turn around and essentially make me beg for a refill when I’m in withdrawal?! [info] None [info] 1582682735
sandsnatchqueen [info] 2 opinions are better than one imo if you have decent insurance or have the money. There's always the chance of other issues that may be more serious than adhd and one may find something else. Then you can decide from there. From my personal experience I was diagnosed with bipolar and adhd (lamictal+seroquel +adderall for treatment)  and only my second psych diagnosed me correctly. The first one put me on meds that exasperated my bipolar manic episodes (ssri's + adderall aren't a great combo for most) . So I'm all for second opinions.  [info] None [info] 1513306731
es_unpan [info] I feel like I’m finally becoming who I want to be I can’t tell this to anyone I know in real life without overwhelming them. But I finally feel like I can accept my past mistakes, learn from them and move on. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very late in my life after I had grown through series of toxic and abusive relationships and friendships. Anything, you name it. It got a bit worse right after my diagnosis. I don’t even think I could mention it here. But now, it’s been a few years since it happened.I look back and I cringe so hard at my choices. More than 90% of them were made due to fear of abandonment. I would do anything to keep anyone in my life, even if they wanted me to die or kill myself because I had loved them so much.  Now I could care less if I were put in those situations again. I feel stronger now. I feel less submissive and more in control of my life and my emotions. It felt awful being myself but after being properly diagnosed, it made it easier for me to be aware of my actions, emotions and surroundings.I feel bad I can never go back and fix my mistakes. It ruined career opportunities for me, college opportunities, opportunities to make good friends. But, now, all I can do is move on. I think about what I could’ve done better in the past but now I feel like I know who I am. Always changing every day, nothing is the same anymore but I am growing to become a better person. Or at least, I’m really trying. I hope someday I can stop the bad memories from flooding my mind every single day altogether. I just wanted to share, I finally feel a change coming. I hope good changes, love, and good fortune come to you too, to whoever is reading this. [info] None [info] 1586684753
IAmKhaleesi76 [info] Do I have aspergers? I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I feel like it's something else. I always felt weird or different compared to other people. Growing up my mom would joke about autism and stuff, so I believed that autism was just one set thing, and that everyone who had it couldn't think or were smart (which I realized was totally wrong after I took psychology courses). But until I got with my bf who has aspergers, it never really clicked with me that I might have it. It's hard to understand something when you read about it, but it's different when you see it. He believes I have it, and so does our friend who has it too. An example of it today is when my bf was on the phone with me, and we were talking about this mmo we're into. He was talking about how you level up faster by straying from the main quest and go out killing higher level monsters, but immediately I got agitated and explained that the quest is there for a reason and it's set up level by level. It's just really irritating because you're supposed to go by the quest, but really I guess a lot of people put it off. Anyway, when I was little I would stare at people, so much that one time I didn't notice my mom leaving me in the check out line in the store. I would also rub my index finger with my thumb a lot because it made me feel better and I liked how it felt, and when I was upset I'd pinch the sides of my clothes. I hated jeans, turtlenecks, and my mom would cut out my tags. I did grow up socially isolated due to my abusive father, but I'm worried that maybe my behaviors stem from that and I'm just looking for a way to relate to my bf ? I have to force myself to look people in the eyes, and I get so nervous trying to plan out a conversation in my head while I'm talking to someone. By the time I have something to say, we're on a totally different subject and so I hold it back because I don't want to look weird. Then I keep that conversation in my head and analyze it and think of all the things I could've said. I hate the feeling of makeup, I still hate jeans and turtlenecks, I HAVE to keep my nails short or I'm irritated all the time, I need time away from everyone because I get exhausted socializing or I'll get upset, I can spend a couple hours looking for something because I'm determined to have it and when I don't find it I end up punching pillows and crying (or if something goes wrong), I adapt to people around me because I don't want conflict with them, I feel like I'm fake, I dress mostly in comfortable graphic tees and sweatpants or yogas, I've never seen the point of doing stuff to my hair other than brushing it, my feelings are hard to tell apart and they're so intense to the point I can't do anything else, I've always been told I'm intense and too serious, I've been called stuck up, I tend to let other people talk and just stand there to watch them, when I say something I expect one reaction but instead they take it the wrong way, the list goes on and on. This is just from the top of my head. Oh and I didn't understand metaphors until I was 15/16, and whatever ones I understand were explained to me. I have a psychiatrist appointment in a couple days and I just wanna know if this is worth bringing up, or if I'm just over thinking and my bf just noticed similar things?

PugsAndPuns [info] Short answer: I don’t.Long answer: I feel really awful about myself and decide to do something about it. I work really hard at it but then I get frustrated and discouraged and stop all progress until my next bout of extreme self-hating. I make long and detailed “action plans,” outlining what I’ll eat, an exercise routine, goals, etc. and declare my dedication to “actually stick with it this time.” Given a little bit of time and it all falls apart again. Repeat this cycle indefinitely. I think it’s also worth noting that I am diagnosed with bipolar I with borderline personality disorder traits, so my mental instability is also a major contributor to this pattern.

mascara_party [info] My mother refuses to acknowledge my mental illness. I was diagnosed with bipolar more than 5 years ago, and finally came out and told my mother. Why, I have no idea. If I talk to her on the phone and seem a little down, she goes "Oh, I know you have a little bit of bipolar so I'll let you go and get some rest." She refers to my manic episode as "wow, you were really out of your mind and not in reality" instead of showing any sign of compassion. Anyway, just wanted to share and see if anyone had similar painful experiences. I have found this community really helpful in terms of understanding how troubled my mother is. She is very mentally unstable herself, but obviously refuses therapy or medication. [info] None [info] 1515871162

happybbbear [info] I’m ruining all of my relationships and I can’t stop I have no control over my emotions anymore. I was diagnosed with bipolar about 5 years ago but I never really thought much of it. I wouldn’t say I was in denial, it just didn’t effect me as much. I was always either on meds or smoking a bunch of weed which really helped me. I have been off meds for over 2 years now and I’ve recently stopped smoking weed completely. I am becoming mean and irritable and cold and depressed and lazy and careless. I know I am and I can feel it happening and it’s beginning to really effect my relationships. My mother and I haven’t been getting along. At least she kind of understands. She knows I have it and just wants me to get on medication. I don’t want to though because I’ve tried countless pills and all of them have terrible side effects. It’s like they might fix my bipolar but they will completely fuck me up in another area of my life. And I’ve been so mean to my boyfriend. We have been dating for 3 years and he knows I’m bipolar but that doesn’t make it okay for me to be like this towards him. He doesn’t deserve it because he really does just want to help me. But he doesn’t understand what it feels like to me to have a bad brain with all of these problems and feel out of control in your own mind all the time. I’ve been cold and mean to him lately. And the worst part is I have no idea why. He has been nice and patient and caring but I just can’t even look at him some days. I don’t know what to do anymore and saying sorry isn’t enough anymore.  I just want my mania to come back so I can be happy for a while. If I keep up with this I will have no one. I don’t want to be mean to the people I love. It’s making me hate myself so much and become so much more depressed and it’s like this long, evil, never ending cycle. I am terrified to go back on meds and I’m too broke to be smoking weed every day and too depressed to find a good coping skill like working out or anything. I know I need to just suck it up and do it but it’s so much harder than it seems and I’m sick of not being normal. I just want to be normal. I don’t want to end up all alone.

ziasun [info] Father is a serial killer This is just my story, and I have no idea where to put this, so I'm releasing it to the world in this fashion. As a kid, I never knew why I was adopted. I wasn't even adopted through an agency, but rather through a gynecologist who knew my adoptive father (worked in the same hospital). I never thought I would find my family, as the doctor who delivered me eventually passed away, and I was given up at 2 minutes old, leaving me with virtually no paper trail to follow. I grew up with a loving mother and a struggling father. As a teenager I fell deep into drug abuse and addiction. I honestly blamed it on the repeated abuse from my adoptive father (also an addict). I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I took my medication and attended meetings and sobered up. This year through 23andMe, I found my biological family. Growing up an only child, I now have 11 siblings/half siblings. My mom had 5 of us (the rest on dad's side), and she started having kids when she was 14. Three of her kids were taken by CPS, and the last two of us were adopted. I just met my mom. It was amazing to find her - the similarities were incredible and we immediately felt like best friends. However, she informed me that the reason for my adoption was that my biological father was a serial killer. I looked up my father's name to find various charges for meth trafficking and counterfeit money as well. He's dying in prison. He was a successful business owner, but was stuck with a long line of mental illness that had been passed down. I often question what is nature and what is nurture. Once again, I don't know what to do with this information, but it's out there now. If you're out there looking for your biological family, prepare yourself, just in case.

williamwilliam1 [info] why is it so hard to take off my diagnosis lenses? A year and a half ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 after a possible hypomanic episode induced by prozac. Since then, I have been at an all time low, one I have not been able to recover from. Everything I do or experience is filtered through my diagnosis where I analyze if it is either pathological/symptomatic and how it relates to my possible episode (I still haven't fully accepted that it was). What am asking is how do I stop doing this? I miss just living life and taking all the good and bad things as they come. Now, I am so paranoid that everything I do is because of BP2 that I can't get my feet back underneath me.Anything helps.

ran_out_of [info] Me too ! They're insane. Done my head in. Can't be dealing with the frustration anymore. Online will be better.Part of is as I am diagnosed with bipolar ( just think is a mood symptom of low testosterone for years though) doctors treat you differently I've noticed if I mention it or not.Also part of it is I am English living and working in Germany and I don't speak german. So they resent talking in English probably assume I don't have a job so see me as foreign mentally ill scum and probably assume I am on benefits and using their welfare system. So they see me as dirt. I probably pay just as much taxes as they do though. I don't want the battle anymore the stress is not worth it so online is the best thing for me. Especially as I keep moving countries and may be moving to Switzerland at end of the year so if I keep everything online I won't need to go through this again in a new country.Never get a mental illness put on your medical records it really does change the way you are treated. It gives them permission to discount everything you say. [info] None [info] 1555684986
AnnieMouse22 [info] What's the deal??? (Sorry, Long) Throw Away Account, SD knows my screen name I think.I've been seeing my SD for over 6 months. We saw each other at a company party but didn't speak, then a few months later I met him from SA. We worked at the same company until I left In January.From the beginning, we had an emotional attachment to each other. We talked about his previous arrangements and one of the girls he was hooked on, and we talked about my ex whom had moved out of state which resulted in our break up.Here and there little issues had come up (thinking I was taking other people's side versus his at work), calling me uneducated because I don't have a bachelor's degree (I've also been a single Mom since 18), and telling me that I'm crazy when we have disagreements (I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years ago but has since been told I don't have that by other mental health professionals).Last night we were texting while he was hanging out at his house (I assume that's where he was) and I was watching an older movie that he suggested. There was a scene about a husband cheating on his wife (he's divorced and there were no cheating in that relationship) and I had asked him if he felt the statement in the movie was true (cheating has nothing to do with the wife, but the inability to realize a man's youth is over) and somewhere along the lines he got incredibly upset with me and threatened to cut me off and stated that he would get a restraining order if I continued to bother him.I was absolutely dumbfounded and had no idea what he was even talking about since nothing we were talking about had anything to do with him or his previous experiences (he's said that he has felt I've attacked him previously due to not taking his side about things at work). What I find incredibly confusing is that I spend ALL free time with him or at his house. I do his grocery shopping, laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc. To me, it shows my appreciation to him for everything that he's done for me since us meeting.I was able to get him to calm down last night but I haven't spoken with him at all today. I'm basically letting things blow over, but I always see him on Tuesdays the week that I'm not as free and I've also bought him some things that should be arriving tomorrow. Should I wait for him to text me or should I go ahead and ask if our plans are still moving forward tomorrow? Also, I usually spend my free weekends at his house (Which is this upcoming weekend) and I'm not sure if I'm still suppose to be doing that. He said he would help me get the security deposit and first months rent for a bigger apartment but I don't want him to think that it's the only reason why I want to see him.Help a girl out because this was hella unexpected. I mean, it wasn't two days before when he said he was glad that we met and he enjoys our time together AND he likes that I spend the week at his house when I have no responsibilities.

fakefreckles [info] I second this! I rapid cycle *a lot* so it's really difficult for me to commit to things, be it relationships or work or what-have-you. I feel like I live inside my head and external stimuli irritates the holy crap out of me, because it distracts me from all the important going ons inside my head. That being said, I love making new friends but I tend to overshare a lot, so when I feel like people aren't reciprocating and appreciating my efforts in getting to know them I flip *instantly* and boom, I'm knee deep in a depressive episode. As for OP, welcome to the club! I was diagnosed with bipolar II about two years ago and ever since then things have started to make more sense to me. As in, I now understand why I am the way I am. I'm extremely unpredictable with my moods and thoughts and wants, and I'm always lowkey irritated because my mind is just so *busy.* Most of the time I feel like I'm on a wild rollercoaster ride that I can't get off of and I'm often really tired because of it. I also have OCD tendencies like you, I'm very particular about my home and the placement of things. I get very upset if there's mess or things like that. Maybe I like order because my mind is so chaotic? It's a mystery. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1477589884
LastStark [info] My family have been making me miserable for years and now I finally admitted to myself that I hate them I feel like a bad person. This is a lot of text so I apologise, but I'd be massively grateful for any opinions on this. It's the first time I've typed it all out like this.My mum never abused me or anything, and she always kept food in my mouth and a roof over my head, and generally did her best, most of the time. My real dad was a real piece of shit, used to kill all of our pets and beat my mother in front of me. Eventually she stormed out and left and we actually had to leave town because he was threatening to kidnap me and attempt to leave the country. I was four to five years old while all this was going on and apparently I barely ever spoke despite having a pretty good command of English at the time. I always just read and stayed quiet. When I did talk, it was apparently me begging her to get us and my tiny baby sister away from him. We move around. A lot. Never long enough for me to get used to socializing with other kids. I pretty much just gave up on it.Fast forward a few years and she's met a fairly decent guy in comparison. Nowhere near as fucked up as my real dad. But he comes from a family that's still stuck in the fifties. As soon as him and my mum got serious he started beating me when he 'looked after' me and my sister if we misbehaved. Bear in mind we were mostly good kids considering the environment we came from. He took a belt to me a fair few times and used to belt the back of our knees and smack our heads together. He was the kind of guy who'd scream in our faces and smack us to the ground if we talked back. To put it in context, this went on from me being seven to sixteen and he was a six foot bouncer. I remember being furious because my mother was a strictly NO physical punishment kind of person and here was this fucking guy just strolling into our lives and beating the shit out of us for not putting our dishes away properly. I went to her so many times, told her he was hitting us, showed her the bruises and belt marks, but she never believed me. She got married to this guy and I was expected to call him my dad. I got sick of it eventually when I hit sixteen and put on some muscle. He backed me into a corner and started throwing trash at me from out of the bin and I just fucking lunged at him. It took my mother threatening to call the police on him to get him off of me, but I gave him one hell of a bloody nose.Despite seeing him beat the shit out of me she still thought I was lying about all the other stuff, and when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year later, she told me I was 'lying' about that too, that I was just a moody, selfish teenager. Things got a little better around the house. My stepdad threw his weight around considerably less as we got older and actually became pretty chilled out. He ended up breaking down and straight up bawling at me about how badly he felt and how he wishes he could have been better. This was around the time my mum was pregnant with his child, my half-brother. So far he's been an incredible dad to him, and I can't help but feel a little bitter when I see how good he is with him. But, naturally, just as the arrival of my little brother starts pulling our family closer, my mum runs off to have an affair with a married policeman and tears the house apart. I had moved in with my first girlfriend while this was all happening but she kicked my stepdad to the curb after ten years of marriage and told him she wouldn't ever want to be with him again. Now whenever I come back to the town where they live my mum and dad beg to see me and get offended when I don't want to see them. They don't want to hear it when I talk about how much the past has fucked me up. My mum attempts to 'heal' my bipolar and alcoholism with positive energy and New Age stuff. Still insists I'm "Not bipolar, your chakras aren't aligned" and stuff like that. The thing is though, despite my family falling apart after never really being all that great and my girlfriend breaking up with me and kicking me out about six months after my parents split up, I'm blessed with the family I've made for myself. The friends who have fed me and given me sofas and floors to sleep on when I've had nowhere to go. The people who kept me off the streets. I am shocked when I count my blessings and *lose count*. My little brother adores me and I feel closer to him than any of my other blood relatives. I completely dread him turning out anything like me. But I feel shitty for not liking my family, and the fact that I don't want to spend time with them or want them particularly involved in my life now makes me feel like an ungrateful little brat. Yeah, things got pretty bad at times, but we were always fed. We always had clothes and shelter and I feel like I owe them for it. Am I wrong to want them out of my life?

Krazygrunt249 [info] I'm 25 now, but since I was about 13 I knew something felt off but I was able to go about my life. Joined the military at 17, and about halfway through my brain just took a nosedive and I just started failing everywhere. My leaders pushed me to try to get help and I did a few times while in, but stigma got me and I didn't seek the help I needed while I was in. I got out after 6 years without too many hiccups, but December of 2016 I was at my lowest. My girlfriend at the time was always working. I was struggling at my job because of what was happening mentally and was just feeling beyond alone. A bit after new years, I was driving behind a car and it got t-boned hard. I carry a few first aid kits in my car for times like this because I have the training and you just never know. I grab a kit and run for the car that got t-boned. The car was flipped but from the outside it didn't look too bad. The driver was far from ok. Nothing I could do. The other driver is out and already calling 911. I get home eventually very shooken up and I ask my gf to come over and help. She doesn't reply. Next morning she comes over and long story short she leaves me. I lost it. After a few days of self destruction, I knew where I was headed if I didn't get help. I ask my employer for leave and immediately drive myself to the ER because i didn't trust myself alone. After 2 days of waiting I was in a inpatient facility, and was there for 2 weeks. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I finally told myself fuck the stigma and started being very open about my mental health and about therapy. People I've known for years sent me messages about how they have gotten help because of how easy i made it seem. And although some days are very hard to be open, I am so glad I got help. Sorry for the rant.  [info] None [info] 1507258224
ricedreamer [info] I'm 23F and I've had to move back home with my parents after I was committed into the psych ward this past march (I posted in r/AMA about it for people who were curious as to what it was like) and I feel like I'm a million steps back. Before I lived alone, went to university in town and had a pretty good social life. I was spiraling and didnt even notice until my parents brought me in. I was diagnosed with bipolar mania type two and PTSD. I was manic for a couple months, then the hospital sorted me out. But now I feel like I'm back at square one... I know I am much healthier now, and I'm healing and planning to continue school either in January or next fall... But I can't shake the feeling that everything would have been better if I didn't go to the hospital. Which I know is untrue, I was a danger to myself and I know I wouldn't have either been dead or in jail. I'm just upset, teenage me would have not pictured me here back at home, broke, and sorting out my mental health. I wish so much that I was normal. A lot of my friends ditched when I was hospitalized, I do have a few close ones I'm grateful for. It just hurts to realize that I had friends that only cared about drugs and partying, and not myself. I was raped this past December by my friends boyfriend, I left that whole friend group since they told me I lied about it happening - regardless of going to the hospital, having the rape kit done, and reporting it to police. Since that moment my life has turned upside down and it's been super hard to orientate myself back up.

Falcom-Ace [info] I've had about 5 or 6 psychologists and psychiatrists. It was the third one who told me about the diagnosis, so I'm not sure which of the first two actually did the diagnosis and what specifically led them to that conclusion. My third one and I talked about it and went through a more formal diagnostic process with my being involved, wherein he told me that I was very obviously a "covert" schizoid.I'd originally been in therapy for a really bad depressive episode, then later I was diagnosed with bipolar NOS.

aurortonks [info] Oh yeah, of course. I used to regularly smash dishes in the kitchen when I got mad, before I was diagnosed with bipolar. Now, I get urges to smash stuff which ends up me usually punching myself in the leg or slapping myself in the face (these instances are very rare nowadays). I've come close to smashing things like my pc, laptop, phone, kindle, etc as well but haven't done so yet. I try to back off the ledge when the urges hit because I really like my things and damaging them would be heartbreaking once the anger or frustration subside. To do this, I use thought-changing techniques my therapist taught me such as reframing my thoughts into positives, writing down why I'm upset, and holding ice cubes until they get too cold over and over again. I also talk with my spouse when I'm feeling that upset and he helps talk through the thoughts and feelings so that I can calm down gradually while still having my emotions and thoughts validated.

rseymour [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 11 years ago.  I think doctors have made it better.  There is something wrong with me.  This is a mental illness, so it is in my entire nervous system.  In 100 years people will look back and think bipolar people were linked by genetic factors, possibly [mitochondrial defects](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=mitochondrial+defect+bipolar+disorder&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1).  We don't know the long term side effects of all drugs now, but we know that the long term side effect of bipolar ([suicide](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=suicide+in+bipolar&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1)/accidental death) is far more likely.  The first time I ever experienced mania was beyond incredible.  I knew the answer to everything, everything clicked, I saw past the boundaries of society and into the essence of everyone and everything.  So treated I finished my masters in December and I'm on track to finish my PhD this summer.tl;dr: does anyone else think bipolar disorder is a treatable illness and accepting of treatment in lieu of something better????.....because I wish I could live without psychiatric drugs but I realize that I'd rather be safe than hospitalized (and on drugs regardless)bipolar and relatively cool with it.**so...**It's an important thing when your disease makes you 60 times more likely to kill yourself.  That's scary!  If you know someone who has died by their own hand... It's devastating.  Please do what it takes to come to terms with bpd, with what you can do to protect yourself.  It took me a decade to find the right pills to take, and I'm sure that will keep changing in time.  Stay vigilant.  Don't lose your skeptical attitude, but recognize that it is a dangerous disorder.

I too I am struggling on how to go about this whole thing and how to move on without people thinking I am nuts.  Weird thing is I was just diagnosed with bipolar in 2014 so I am not sure if that has anything to do with what’s going on but always looking for help, answers and people who can relate.

EndemicPsychosis [info] Quick rant Hey its u/EndemicPsychosis. Ive posted a little bit before about my frustrating journey trying to get diagnosed. Basically I have psychosis but I don't know whats causing it. I suppose the most likely is either bipolar or schizophrenia. I was diagnosed with bipolar but it was by my primary care doctor on the first day we met with no sort of testing or anything so Im not sure its a trustworthy diagnosis. I asked him for a referral to a psychiatrist but he said he doesnt think I need one. So now Im on my own trying to get good help. I counselor I know through my church suggested I get a psychiatric evaluation done to diagnose me but I cant find a provider who can do the kind of evaluation I need who also takes my insurance. Ive called like seven different people and places now and none of them have worked out. I have a lead on another person now so wish me luck. Anyway its just really hard to find good help around here. Thanks for being such an awesome community. Rant over [info] None [info] 1524781603

cultofvader [info] Crime is what made me want to learn more about the brain and how it works physically and socially, but I was diagnosed with bipolar I and II within the last year and it's been a terrible struggle to get the medical help that I need, so I started doing a bunch of research on my own time about it and it interests me to the point I think I could do it as a career. I would love to focus on research and development of the knowledge around mental health but I know that the process of doing that is very jaded and messed up, so I probably won't be able to do that, I've always wanted to help people and in doing that I've found things that make people happy (like theatre for some). Things have been a very long and hard journey for me as far as mental health goes and in my opinion mental health is more important than physical in a lot of cases and I want people to know that someone actually understands what they're going through and wants to help them. I'm caught in the middle of doing two things I love which I guess isn't the worst struggle to have but oh well.  [info] None [info] 1510857953
crazyausachick [info] One small move I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and I have ptsd. Earlier this year the ptsd was really bad but I've managed to gain some control over it. I moved to a new city for a new job and I hate both of them, and it's been about 9 months. I feel really trapped and bored. But I don't trust myself to make any decisions or big moves or even do anything to alleviate my boredom. I can't tell if my boredom is mania induced as I feel twinges of impulsivity and so I'm afraid to do anything about it. In July I had a severe depressive episode and finally ended up stabilized back on lithium but I've also played with my lithium as the side effects were problematic. My doctor knows this and he and I are working on a solution with meds. However I feel really isolated and really agitated and bored. I feel like I'm wasting time, I keep thinking about quitting my job and moving somewhere else. I'm homesick for my other city that I was already desperate to leave to come here.... my solution is always to move. I don't have any friends here. I feel hopeless and like something might just crack inside of me and I just need to leave...but again I go back to feeling like I can't trust my decision making. I also have this feeling that nothing is familiar to me. I think this is a ptsd thing. Over the past 3 years I've lived in 3 countries and 4 or 5 major cities. And all of the sudden nothing is feeling familiar to me here in this place I've been for 9 months. And I'm finding that scary. I am scared that if I allow myself to even make one small move that could lead to manic behavior that's all it would take for me to just crumble and completely lose the plot.

AccioMotherfucker [info] I get paid in two weeks on the 28th. I'm thinking of buying a cheap shotgun and ending it. I'm a drug addict. I use cocaine, opiates, alcohol, benzos, and heroin occasionally. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years and I guess I do the drugs to self-medicate.Well I went to the psychiatrist and went though 60 pills in one way (30x 1mg clonazepam and 30x Temazepam) and I'm tired of this roller coaster. I can't stand it anymore. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years and last night in the car we were talking about my abuse issues. I told her I've tried to get help so many times and it never works. I'm an addict and that's it. I asked if she would be okay without me, and she said "I would make do without you, I could raise the kids myself, move back with my parents, etc."So I told her that she has until the end of the month to make a decision. Does she want me in her life or not? I told her to have fun explaining to the kids that their father won't be around anymore. This is all I ever wanted out of life. A wife and kids who love me. I want to see my little boys grow up (4yo and 6mo) and they absolutely adore me.I've always had suicidal tendencies and I'm tired of being a drug addict with a mental disorder. My bipolar will not go away as I get older, I'll be there forever, and right now it feels like my marriage won't.I have a problem, though. I don't want to hurt anyone. I know they'll be hurt but in her words "I'll get over it."I've been thinking about this for a while now. Do I need to write a will or something like that? It should be painless if I use buckshot. I can walk into any gun store and walk out with a shotgun + ammo within two or three hours.2017 was supposed to be good to me. I got a good job, moving to  a new place, etc,. People WILL miss me. People WILL hurt when they realize that I will never be around anymore to make them laugh and smile.I won't get to see my baby smile anymore, or read beditime stories to my oldest. Never again will I kiss my wife's lips or hold her when she cries.She put the straw on the camel's back It's happening. Of course I can't tell a psych. because they will lock me up for 3 days and that'll do nothing.10 days. [info] None [info] 1479547269
MelsWhitePubes [info] After my dad died, I got put on a high dose of antidepressants that fucked with my head majorly, for two reasons that I didn't understand for years later.  First, I find out through genetic testing that certain SSRIs are 7 times as effective on me than the average person...I was on the maximum recommended dose of Effexor.  Then, some time after that, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and was told that ANY dose of SSRI could cause my otherwise mild manic episodes to be much worse...I didn't know either of these things when I experienced the following...I had found my old livejournal page from the really 2000s, and reading it I saw lots of things I had no memory of.  This scared me and I did some research, and found that my antidepressants could cause memory loss.  One of the most disturbing lost memories was an auto collision I had in a Taco Bell drive through, because I described it in great detail...I was rear-ended, pushed into the brand new car in front of me, and all the cars had to pull into the parking lot and wait for the police to come work out what happened, spent almost two hours there making sure I would not be found at fault.  I had specific times recorded, and had 0 memory of any of it.  Over time, fragments of the memory came back to me - filling out a description of the accident under the yellow parking lot lights, being administered a breathalyzer, calling my insurance company and giving my phone to the cop because I didn't have my proof of insurance in the car... It was still fragmentary and like a dream, though.Years after that, after my mother died, an old ex girlfriend got in touch with me for the first time in years.  I asked her why she cut off all contact with me back in the day, and she asked "Did you break into my apartment?"  "Of course not, why did you think it was me?" "You had been texting me all day to give you back the laptop you gave me, so that night I took it to work with me, when I got home my apartment was broken into but nothing was taken, I assumed it was you because you were acting crazy after your dad died."  I told her it wasn't me and said she really should have asked me at the time.  Then, for no apparent reason, I asked if there was a footprint on the door, as that would show whether it was me (I have unusually large feet).  She didn't remember a footprint, and I was so obviously surprised and offended by the accusation that she apologized for thinking it was me.Afterwards, I kept thinking about that time, and the memory came back to me... Going to her apartment at night... Taking one of my mother's shoes and using it to put a muddy footprint on her door, then pushing it in with my shoulder... Looking for the laptop, then leaving without it.And, some time after that, I realized that the livejournal entry about the accident in the Taco Bell drive through was a fabrication to give me an alibi for where I was at the time I broke in, in case her neighbors reported something.  All the memories related to the accident were false, and created years after the fact when I completely forgot why I made up that story. [info] None [info] 1500915250
kicsikucsi [info] Dear dad, I know that I wasn't always the most ideal daughter, and maybe I didn't make you proud enough. At 21 years old, looking back, I remember thinking my life would be a lot different. I remember turning 13 and thinking that, however arbitrary the difference between 12 and 13 was, my "teens" would be absolutely great, and that by now, I would have lots of friends, money, a career I loved, or I'd be in college.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD and GAD with severe agoraphobia right before you passed away three months ago. All of it has been very hard on me. My biggest fear is that you died thinking I was a disappointment somehow, or that I did not make you proud enough. I guess I have some updates for you.&amp;#x200B;I remember you wondering why I didn't ever go out or do anything outside of the house. You'd encourage me to get out whenever I could. To live life to the fullest like you did.It's nothing *big*, I just wanted to let you know that for the first time in my life, I walked outside all by myself for five days in a row and got my own food and interacted with people. All on my own. I wanted to tell you about that.You died during the transitional period of seeing me grow as a woman, and I have a lot I wish I could share with you. I still take my medications and go to therapy, which you seemed to be happy with. You said you noticed a big change in me and that I seemed to be doing better.I've been thinking about going back to school next year. I've been looking for jobs after being unemployed for six or seven months. I know you like my current boyfriend a lot; you expressed being finally happy and relieved to know that I found someone that actually treats me well.So I wanted to say that things are going pretty well between us, and in a month and a half it'll be one year of us being together. I spent two weeks at his apartment and just got home yesterday. He was the one that encouraged me to go out and do things by myself for once, but you were the one that inspired me. More recently, I've heavily considered moving in with him within the next year, but I'm not so sure yet. When I told you that I thought about this before, you were very supportive of it and happy for me, but mom is very lonely without you. No matter how much she reassures me that it's okay if I choose to "*go on my own way*", I feel very guilty at the thought of leaving her alone. I miss you lots, and at times, painfully so. I wish you'd give me more advice. I'm not sure what to do, or where to begin sometimes. I still don't always like myself, but I feel confident knowing that you are my dad. I hope everything is great wherever you are, and that this message finds you well. &amp;#x200B;Love, your daughter&amp;#x200B;P.S. The Packers won over the Bears again. I remembered you told me to never bet against them during their rivalry matches, and I guess that you were right. [info] None [info] 1568533619

lexior [info] I lived in Finland for a very long time and grew up there intermittently. From my experience:The social pressure that if you don't drink (enough) you are viewed as weak, especially amongst "the boys" (mostly in the youth culture I've noticed this)The fact that kela Will not provide me with English forms because I have a Finnish passport and speak the language (I speak it decently, but I don't think anyone speaks kela)As a child, the schools very tolerant behaviour towards bullying. I was locked into a bathroom for half of the day by a classmate and no action was taken. I was also on multiple occasions told by teachers that it was my fault for being strange or out of the ordinary. I hear these types of stories a lot from Finnish friends. The lack of information provided on the social structures aimed to help youth unemployment is abysmal. Yes, you have places like osaamo in Helsinki, but there are very very few ways to get informed about things you can do as a twenty something struggling to navigate life.The absolute fucking mess that is the mental health treatment. It took me two months to get into crisis counselling through my doctor, after which it took another two months to start any kind of treatment. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I had prior diagnoses from the NL clearly stating I had complex PTSD. I was put on medication without proper explanation as to why. Then admitted into aurora for day therapy for two months. After which I was deemed cured and handed a prescription for quetiapine and peragablin and sent on my merry way. From what I've heard, this is not at all uncommon and Finland still suffers from a backwards thinking when it comes to mental health. The bureaucracy absolutely does not help and the devastating rate of successful suicide attempts is testament that this should be talked about.The Finnish Postal service could suck my dick if I had one as well.Don't get me wrong, I love Finland, the beauty and the people, but there are issues that I think especially outsiders ignore because Finland really is viewed as this utopia where socialism meets capitalism in this beautiful marriage of alcoholic coffee drinking Adonis bodied sauna goers.

huntybunchesofoats [info] I've Been Saved for a Year! Here's my Testimony. I grew up in a Lutheran household and was baptized as a baby and confirmed, but something was always missing, maybe I wasn't mature enough, maybe God had other plans, all I know is that I was not saved. As a reached my sophomore year of high school I became severely depressed, I began to cut and had no hope for life. I ended up in an outpatient mental hospital where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Wile at the hospital I began to hate God for putting this on me me. Once I reached my junior year of high school I began to question my sexuality, after some months of seeking ended up coming out as gay, the whole time disregarding God. It was half way through junior year of high school that I came out to my best friend, he was Christian and immediately became concerned. After months of arguments and a few full out fights, he convinced me to To the night at his house and we read the Bible, this sparked an interest in me that I had never had before l. After weeks of talking and convincing I agreed to go to church with him, I went to the youth service on Wednesday night. Long story short I felt outcasted and hated and I left in a rage. My friend apologized and next week I decided to try again. Most of that Wednesday night was a blur and honestly I don even remember the sermon, but that was the night I accepted Christ and received the Holy Spirt. The next day at school was honestly horrible, I began to see sin every where and the worst part was I saw it in myself, and it horrified me. That same day I sat in my history class and I heard  the word "pray" this shocked me but I bowed my head and began to pray during class, it was in that prayer I heard the words "you are not gay" and from that point on I no longer believed I was gay despite my "all in" mentality (I was actually planing to go to and upcoming pride parade). I got plugged in at a the church that my friend brought me to and I was baptized for the repentance of my sins. Well it's a year later, and I can't say it has been easy. It honestly was a giant struggle trying to find a balance between relying full on grace or fully on legalism. I can gladly say now after a year I have learned to fight sin, but when I fail know that I am forgiven. Me and the guy who brought me church are the best of friends and love sharing our experiences with each other. Oh and the gay thing, well I would be lying if I said I didn't have temptation, but temptation is not a sin, even Jesus was tempted, it's what you do with it. I  hope this helps or inspires some of you. God is the light of my life and I can now share that with two world, I pray that God is with you all, and that you all have a blessed day wherever you are.

The fact that somebody's thyroid can do that same shit to them seemed so wild and awful.As somebody who's been down that road as well, even if for different reasons, you have my sincere empathy.

PrairieWulf [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type II rapid cycling) six years ago although it has ruined me for my entire life. My loved ones made little to no effort to learn about it or help me. My friends all disappeared. When I was put on income assistance and couldn't afford my place anymore I had to move to another city because my cousin was the only person that could help me out, but that situation was way worse (at least six people at any time living in a three bedroom party house). That was year three, things got so much worse, and it doesn't account for the nightmare my life was for the 22 years leading up to the diagnosisI am never going to be able to get out of this myself. I have one friend in the city I live in now and he does his best to keep my spirits up but he's never going to help me change my lot in life and I can't do it alone. My only hope is that one day some kind person will take me in and help me get my legs under me before I kill myself. The only reason I haven't done it yet is to spare my family the pain, but I can't keep going on like this. [info] None [info] 1408541666
rachelway82 [info] Apparent I do have bpd I've been seeing my therapist for about 7 months. I was diagnosed with bipolar last summer. Yesterday I was talking to my therapist about how I used to be afraid I had borderline personality disorder. She said "you do". It really caught me off guard. I am trying to word this in a way that doesn't offend anyone, but I've only ever read bad things about bpd. I've read that some therapists won't even treat patients with it. When I was a kid my Mom always told me I was being manipulative or just trying to get attention whenever I got upset. Now it looks like maybe she was right. I spent most of yesterday lurking on this sub, and really did identify with a lot of what I read. But with all I've read online about people with bpd, its hard not to feel shame. It does seem to be very stigmatized. Did anyone else have a hard time accepting this diagnosis? I apologize if this post comes off as judgemental, it really isn't my intent. I just thought maybe talking to someone else with bpd might make me feel less alone. If this post is inappropriate please delete it. [info] None [info] 1493388580
krackle_wins [info] Question about bipolar 2 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 a few years ago. After going though the regular routine of med cocktails I’ve settled on 200mg of lamictal, 10 mg of lexapro (down from 20, which I was on 20 for over 2 years), vraylar, quick-dissolve klonopin.I just had an absolute manic attack in which I decided to clean my entire apartment at 2:00am when I have a physical and blood work at 8am. I’ve been extremely stressed and overworked at work (network/telecom engineer), been having issues with my direct supervisor, while being friends with the director of operations (we even game together). What can be causing my first really bad manic episode in over 3 years and finally settling on a decent med mixture? I just saw my psychiatrist less than a week ago and I felt fine. Right now I’m freaking out over minor messy stuff, my apartment is immaculate but for some reason I can’t stand it and swear it’s a disaster. Please explain to me why this is suddenly happening again, I’m worried about another in-patient stay. I had more to explain but my mind is racing too fast to remember everything and get it down in this post.Edit: I’ve also been spending money like crazy lately. I’ve been working on rebuilding my credit and started a retirement fund (I’m only 33), but somehow my checking account is overdrawn which I also haven’t let happen in years.

I also find my attention jumps around, hyper focuses on something then jumps around again. Does anyone else experience something like this ? how do you feel if you forget/skip your pills ?

redbellymess [info] How to get through the waiting game (23f in Australia) I’m in full struggle at the moment with a horrible psych appointment last week I feel like there’s nothing left for me to do. My gp referred me to a psychiatrist because of suspicions of adhd, I was diagnosed with bipolar II nearly three years ago, tried different meds, different therapies for nothing to help.I’m at the point where I feel that my mental health has beaten me. I have another psych appointment in 6 weeks to get a second opinion after last week and I don’t think I can keep waiting. I have nothing left to put into this, I feel so defeatedHow do I get through the waiting, I’m so close to giving up, is there anything I can suggest to my gp that could help for the time being?

Muscularitalian [info] Was Bipolar, might be Flaring up years later or stress? Hey all, I have some questions.I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, bipolar NOS when I was 22, im 29 now. Needless to say at the time I had a DWI, low testosterone levels and was on a natural herb to try to bring them up and I just flipped one night, and was put into a hospital the next morning.Lately im not sure if it's stress or im going through something. Recent thoughts / things:* I dont like family parties much, usually because im still treated like a kid* Been flipping at my mother lately like I used to, throwing threats when its not her fault. (THIS IS ONGOING ON AND OFF FOR ALMOST A YEAR)* Have slight pent up anger towards my father, not much though since I lived with him for years* Getting agitated when people over talk to me./ when i lose control. Then I have angry thoughts about them and stuff sometimes lasting for a week or more at random times.When i was younger I would get angry flip tables..etc but i saw my dad doing that growing up so i think i was just following suit. But im 29 now, and no I dont do that at all i still flip in ways when my ego gets hit, ive been very sensitive to peoples motivation level and reactions they give me when i give them news about my life. Hence closing a deal, they dont have a reaction and then i get pissed and take it as their not happy for me when on Ability i wouldn't of cared. But that medication made me NOT use my head and just act and go 24 /7 which is never good.Been off medication (abilify 2mg) for over 2 years now, and all was going great up until a year and a half ago when I couldn't workout anymore, I was a bodybuilder / gymnast (at home but still i took it seriously) for over 10 years, so i lost that part of my life. Also my short term memory has been pretty bad too.Overall, im pretty happy. But I still feel all over the place, I have $2 in my account, $1100 in rent coming up, starting my business and stressful thoughts thats my family is going to be jealous when I make more money then them(They are jealous people so this is valid). So it's alot at once to take it.Not sure if its bipolar, or the fact im in my room ALL DAY working on the computer from home(Im a programmer), at all odd hours (its 3:30am and i still didnt sleep since my schedule is off from my work). When I step outside even for 10 minutes in the sun i feel so much better. So its a bit confusing at times, since most of the time everything is perfect, I put in a good act, I can act in society perfectly, enjoy my life overall, its just those small things I mentioned before since i am neither depressed nor happy, just monotone in ways if that makes sense.Thank you [info] None [info] 1498040476
CleanExpression [info] I’m not looking for posthumous fame or anything. I am writing for the story’s sake. It helps me feel better when I’m feeling low and it calms me down during manic episodes. Genre is realistic or literary fiction.I only care if somebody somewhere reads it and understands what I went through. I have one other published book, which I wrote after I was diagnosed with bipolar. I wrote it in an attempt to communicate how I feel through a short story about someone whose life is managed by an unpredictable and unpleasant force beyond her control, in the hopes that someone would resonate with my writing and find solace in it. Maybe it would even help them out of a rut. That’s what art is for in my opinion. The book I’m currently working on is more of a coming of age story. It’s very (and I mean REALLY) loosely based on a pretty traumatic event I went through in my mid teens (although there isn’t really a self-insert in it) that changed how I look at the world. my expectations are for its reception are low, but I hope somebody somewhere will find it entertaining or helpful or even say it has artistic merit. I don’t really care as long as I get the story down how I wanna tell it and there’s nothing left to say about it. I know that if I can do that it’ll speak volumes to people about what I live with everyday. It’s not just my experiences I wanna convey, its the reality of bipolar disorder. I’ve thought a lot about this, and there’s this quote from Virginia Woolf’s _To The Lighthouse_ that I think relates to this a lot. I debated even putting it in the back of certain editions of my first book:&gt; Now all the candles were lit up, and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light, and composed, as they had not been in the twilight, into a party round a table, for the nightwas now shut off by panes of glass, which, far from giving any accurate view of the outside world, rippled it so strangely that here, inside the room, seemed to be order and dry land; there, outside, a reflection in which things waved and vanished, waterily.I want my writing to be like those candles.

Awkward_Dachsund [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 14, although it never quite felt "right" - I fit some criteria but not a majority of it, which led me to keep learning and looking other possible diagnoses. Well, one hospitalization later at 19, I started seei ng a different clinician and she diagnosed me with BPD, sayi ng I don't *quite* fit the criteria for bipolar. I was elated and started reading up on BPD and as I did I felt more and more confident in the diagnosis. Educate yourself and compare what you learn to your own feelings/thoughts, it's worth it [info] None [info] 1561678912
rg1213 [info] Great and accurate observation of what it must be like to be crazy. I'm a pretty sane person, but I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (pretty well treated now with meds) and let me tell you, when I'm not doing good, whether manic or depressed, stuff that's not real absolutely seems 100% real; there is no doubt in my mind that something irrational is true. Later I look back and am amazed that I felt that way. I believe that there is a lot of stigma right now associated with being mentally ill, with taking medication, seeking help, etc., and I hope over time people realize more and more that mental illness is a physical disease of the brain and treat it accordingly.

SincerelySasquatch [info] Yeah, man. And all psych meds should cease production and everyone should just smoke pot. When I was a teenager I was a typical moody teenager and my parents didn't want to deal with me so they send me to the psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and now that I grew up I am pretty much fine except occasional moodiness, (that's bipolar, right?) I don't take meds, I don't want that poison in my body, I just inhale all the chemicals from combustion of marijuana and it helps because I am high all the time so I don't know what's going on and I am not sad anymore! So fuck big pharma and those poisons they give us, all those schizophrenics and bipolar people should just smoke pot like me! [info] None [info] 1512451898

parisfrance137 [info] Was this my first "manic" episode? Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder last summer and started taking Lamictal not long after being diagnosed. I did have to have my dosage upped a bit as the dosage I was on before just wasn't cutting it. I've noticed over the last couple weeks that I've begun to pick up on certain things that maybe I never noticed before. Sometimes I notice I'll get in these moods where I'll suddenly feel "giddy" or "excited" and feel like I have so much hope or drive. In these moments, I'll even feel so happy that I'll talk A LOT and may come across as hyper. Other times, like today, I'll feel irritated at everyone and depressed. I feel like I just want to cry. My husband asked me one day if when I get jittery if maybe I could have ADD, as he gets that way when his ADD goes off. I said no, that I believe I may be experiencing a manic episode and never realized it.&amp;#x200B;Has anyone else experienced symptoms like this before? [info] None [info] 1556040631
rlm1997 [info] What should I do with my life? I'm 20yrs old, but I feel like I'm 50. Reflecting on my life I remember getting the same look from all of my teachers and peers growing up, ever since I was a young child. Often times it was a wide eyed look, a look of shock, as if I were a crazy or something, and when people talked to me they wouldn't make direct eye contact with me. People still do those things, but I realize now that people do this because of the things that I say and because of the way I act. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15, recently my doctor said that it's moderate, but because I'm very intelligent I've never been hospitalized or anything because of it. This is something that perplexes me, because I always got b's and c's in middle and high school, so I never thought of myself as being really smart, but I'm in college now so apparently I am. I just feel like shit knowing that I'm so smart but have done so much stupid shit and acted like an idiot my whole life.It makes sense though, my family was and still is absolutely terrible. Growing up my parents yelled at each other at the top of their lungs almost every single day and it didn't matter to them when or where it was, in the middle of the night, in the morning, in public, at the grocery store, restaurant, it never failed that an argument would erupt for everyone around us to hear. Neither of them once said, "not in front of our son" or "let's not do this in public". They felt no shame, no embarrassment whatsoever, they couldn't have cared less. I remember getting home from school one day and seeing my mother crying saying, "Your dad just hit me in the private parts call the cops!" and my dad screaming at me "No don't call the fucking cops!!!". Things like that happened many times, and over the span of my entire adolescence. My mom finally broke up with my dad when I was eleven, but just a month later she got with a guy who likes to drink a lot and you know how that goes, and she's still with him. I never got a break. My two older siblings had a different father, and because of the way my dad acted they treated me like garbage and always stuck to themselves. And of course, because of my social akwardness, I got picked on at school by everyone, even the teachers.I'm 270lbs, I have adhd, bipolar disorder, no friends, no girlfriend, but I'm not depressed. I don't have any trouble getting up in the morning, I don't feel like I have no future, I feel optimistic. It's only because now I know that I'm intelligent that I feel obligated to move forward and accomplish great things.My mother and her boyfriend still argue and yell with each other almost every day  and her boyfriend still gets drunk and breaks things and yells in the middle of the night every other week. My grandmother is practically deaf and refuses to wear hearing aids, so whenever try to communicate with her you have to yell. Because she can't hear she sometimes interprets what we say as insults when they're not, and because of that her and my mother often get into very loud arguments almost every single day.I feel like nothing has changed in my life since I was a kid, it's both infuriating and depressing at the same time. Knowing just how much my family screwed me over and for how long they've been doing it pisses me off so bad. I try not to think about this but I just can't help it.I just came here to vent, but if anyone has any suggestions for me, please feel free to comment. [info] None [info] 1527721136
yowzabowsa [info] I have been in similar situation, but from your girlfriend's end. I'm diagnosed with bipolar as well. I was in a relationship with someone during a time when I shouldn't have been. I could hardly take care of myself and it was clear they were unequipped to handle severe mental illness (and very unhappy), so I ended the relationship. I felt very self-conscious about the burden I was placing on my partner. I find it notable that her suicide attempts were before your visits. Not to jump to conclusions but she may have felt that same stress about feeling burdensome.This is always a tough topic to handle. It hurts when people break up with you because of brain chemistry you can't help, but there's no avoiding the fact that serious mood disorders affect the people around you as well. There's also the problem of suicide as a manipulative threat but from your post it doesn't seem to be that kind of situation.Speaking of suicide-- that disturbs me. She was clearly deeply unhappy, and you specifically describe her bipolar illness as severe. Not only that but summer is just now ending-- these were awfully recent. I don't know exactly what "delay" followed but that moment should have prompted IMMEDIATE emergency action, possibly enrollment in a mental health facility for recovery. An actual attempt on your own life is something done in complete hopelessness. Relationships are very hard work and require a lot of sustained effort and communication and it's reasonable to assume that someone trying to take their own life cannot keep a healthy relationship in that time. Is she on medication or in therapy? You haven't made it clear. This is vital. She needs urgent help. It doesn't matter that the attempts were in the past, it's clear she is really not in a good place and is in need of some medical support.You're asking if you did the right thing, so I'm assuming you already broke up with her? In that case: make sure she has a safety net. This should be your first priority. Make sure she knows she is loved and cared for, and that her wellbeing is not dependent on you. I would see if you can get in touch with her parents-- she wants to be near them, so they must have a good relationship. Let them know you're worried for her and want to make sure she's okay. This is especially important if she was not medicated or in therapy. Bipolar left untreated only gets worse. Not only that but a breakup truly makes you feel alone in the world-- if anything she needs to be reminded that she is not.As for whether it was a good decision, your health is just as important as hers. If you truly felt that a breakup was the best option for the both of you, it's okay. The world won't end. Make sure she is loved and safe with her parents, and move on.The only thing I personally feel is better is that if you break it off, to really solidify that the relationship is over in that way. No "but maybe in the future, we may work it out, maybe we just need a break" etc. I feel like the open ends cause more distress than they're worth. Letting her know you care as a friend is good, but from experience I just really feel like implying you two can resume if she gets better is not worth it. Mental illness will never totally go away; you two have discussed long term, but mental illness is absolutely a long term consideration.EDIT: So she has been getting medical help, but feels abandoned. In that case I *really* want to urge you to get in touch with her friends or parents and let her know she's not alone. But don't let her manipulate you into staying. Emotional dependency is definitely unhealthy [info] None [info] 1474292197

roflrobble [info] Dark days ahead   So I guess this is as best place to put this. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 august of 2018. With hindsight, I was dealing with episodes for \~3 years prior to the diagnosis. I would self-medicate to the point to black out drunkenness, I’d take my anger towards myself out on my wife and others.  I’d isolate and contemplate suicide, plan and have one last hurrah before I went through with it, and end up not completing the act. I’ve alienated my family and am now separated from my wife whom I adore. I’m currently headed down a depressive episode. I feel like this illness has stolen my life, a career I loved, and no matter how hard I try, I end up going through another episode which robs me of the progress I’ve made when I was level. I try and keep busy with wood working and gardening but I seem to just get frustrated that I’m not better at such things, give up and just sit here staring at the screen. I’ve caused my wife to get into debt due to being unemployed before separation. Most the time I feel as though she doesn’t want to work on mending the relationship. I’ve caused her so much pain and stress I feel like the life insurance money would at least allow her to start anew. Right now at least, I can’t see me being in any fulfilling career or relationship, and I’m at a loss on how to beat this thing which seems unbeatable really. On top of that, I believe in God and all that, so I have a hard time trying to convince myself to stay here on earth when there’s a much better place. So I guess what I’m looking from you guys is this: How do you get through the really dark days when you’re feeling total shit, alone, and a failure? Thanks [info] None [info] 1556250152
yuriopl [info] What do? Hello all,At my first psychiatrist appointment on March 6, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given a 7-day sample of 1.5 mg Vraylar.However, the psychiatrist was quite off-putting and basically threatened to put me in the hospital if my mom wasn’t there to monitor me 24/7, which is a problem because she is separating from my dad and lives on her own on the weekends. Basically, my mom is taking me to go to another psychiatrist, but the appointment she scheduled with the new one is not until the end of April (the 22nd). Because I’m “in-between” psychiatrists, I didn’t take the medication because the wait time is so long and the sample was for seven days. I honestly don’t think I can wait that long, last week was a good week, I felt really elevated and spent it basically dancing around my room,I even made plans to start writing a book.But this all began to deteriorate around Saturday, when I couldn’t even brush my teeth without crying for 15 minutes straight. Now I’m at school and can’t concentrate at all, I’m shaking and crying and am super behind on assignments, which is a problem since I’m in all IB or AP classes. I have 2 presentations, a research paper, a test etc all this week and I can barely function let alone do all these things. Since I’m still in between doctors, I don’t know how to go about getting an IEP or 504 plan since currently I don’t have a psychiatrist.I’m also experiencing visual and aural hallucinations, e.g seeing insects that aren’t there and hearing voices that aren’t there. Is there any way to speed up the wait time or cope with these symptoms until my next appointment? Or should I just go to the hospital? Thanks [info] Bipolar 1 [info] 1552919896
mackemerald [info] [Spoilers] "I've felt worse" and how that applies to real life So, I know a lot of people liked Lapis' line, "I've felt worse," and I wanted to talk on that just a little. Of course, it's funny and of course a lot of us feel it was a big mood. But I wanted to say that, this is one way I've essentially survived life. So, to be frank, my baby sibling died when I was a kid. Then as a teenager, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I've been through other shit, too, but the point is - I've felt worse. And you've probably felt worse.Not only is that powerful for those of us who know it but if you have any kind of pain and trauma in your life, I'm here to tell you this line will get you through. It doesn't diminish your current pain but it reminds you of your own strength. You've felt worse so you know you can stand up to a fucking (metaphorical) diamond. I love that she said that. Lapis is strong. I'm strong. You're strong. So, I just wanted to point that out so that next time you feel absolutely terrible or you go through something awful, you'll remember. Let yourself feel your feelings but remember that you'll survive. You've got this. Inspiring post commenced. [info] peri is best gem [info] 1530928746
cmcbryant1 [info] I don’t know if it is ok for me to post here. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 3 years ago. For the first time in 6 years I am dating someone. I have laid down “ boundaries “ with him. I would NEVER put my boyfriend through this. I have been hospitalized and I know what to look out for. He is going with me to my doctors and tracking my progress. If I ever was to put him through this he would leave. Though we do have a really hard time with things and we do have intense episodes it is not an excuse to hurt the ones that we love the most. The fact that this person is not taking his disorder seriously is not your fault. I know it is hard but you do not deserve to go through this. It seems like YOU are putting in all the hard work when he isn’t. This disorder is absolutely debilitating sometimes but that does not mean we get a free pass every time. I actually find it very offensive that he is not putting in the hard work like most of us are. This is why people have such a biased option of us some time. You have done everything you possibly could do for him. If he does not take his recovery seriously than you are not to be responsible for him and don’t have to put up with this emotional abuse!!! Stay strong and do what is right for your own mental health !!! [info] None [info] 1567708325

EurekaErika [info] I feel like I'm making this all up in my head... I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 disorder in January of 2017. I have always struggled with medications and adjustments. I'm finally on a decent combination (I think), but I cant help but wonder if I'm actually bipolar. I know logically it's the meds doing what they're supposed to, but what if the doctors are wrong and the meds have a placebo effect on me. Is that a thing? Or do I just think too much? I've put my family through a lot and i always feel really guilty about it. But it's even worse wondering if I've made it all up. Someone please help. I'm really anxious and i cant stop thinking.

rhoslyne [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in middle school, but when I did research about the disorder on my own, the diagnoses didn't really feel right. I didn't think it really fit me. After doing some more digging, I discovered BPD and felt like the symptoms really resonated with me. To fit the criteria, you have to have (I think) 5 out of the 8 markers (again, I might be skewed with the exact numbers here, but I know I'm close lol), and I have/had almost all of them, some more prominently than others, at various times in my life. Went back to the doc with my questions about BPD, they told me they didn't know too much about the disorder because hardly any research had really been done on it at that time, and they recommended I see someone else. Being 13, I was extremely discouraged, and didn't know how to go about finding a new therapist after feeling so wholly abandoned by my first one that the school had appointed to me (ah, classic borderline), so instead of finding someone else to confirm my diagnosis and help me, I withdrew from therapy. About three or four years later, I went to another therapist (briefly) who did formally diagnose me with BPD. They also immediately wanted to treat me with medication, which I had read didn't really work for patients with borderline. They were very offended when I suggested we try talk-therapy instead of meds, as I had read everything I could find on the internet about the disorder, and almost every source said meds don't help, BPD is best treated with talk-therapy (or DBT, dialectical behavioral therapy). That therapist gave me an ultimatum and said that I would take their prescription or find another doctor. I just decided I would try and help myself (which is... Nearly impossible, after *years* of trying, you *need* someone else to stay rational and objective, because folks with BPD can't). Yes, I am currently in a relationship with an amazing man with unmatched patience. It's a constant struggle to have a good, healthy relationship, and mine actually almost ended this past weekend. I'm still an incredibly insecure person, have huge trust and abandonment issues and that causes a lot of strain on my boyfriend in the first place. Couple that with the fact that it is extremely hard to regulate the bombardment of irrational thoughts, and that sometimes I cannot even tell that I'm being irrational (because my imagined fear is SO real in my head, as crazy as it seems to you), and then toss in the fact that folks with BPD can have mood swings with no obvious triggers literally within *seconds*... Yeah, it's hard. Plus there's the whole being combative aspect of it, and the identity issues, and the feelings of emptiness, and the self-loathing... It's not something most people want in a partner.I try my best to stay self-aware and hyper vigilant when it comes to monitoring what I'm thinking and feeling. Where I used to be a person who had no filter, I now take a lot of care to think before I speak, and think about why it makes me feel the way it does, or of I even need to say it. Or if I feel the need to do something impulsive, like shop online or drive recklessly, I try to stop and give myself a friendly reminder that I'm letting my BPD get the better of me again. I thought I was a victim of it for a long time, and sometimes when I'm in the throes of its bullshit, sometimes I still do. But I try to snap myself back to reality and remember that at the end of the day, I can take control.As soon as I have health insurance, I'm finding someone who specializes in DBT. I've really needed it this year. Sorry for all the word vomit. I hope I answered your questions adequately, and if you'd like to discuss it any further, please PM me. I'm happy to chat about it. Erm, or write novels about it. :3 [info] Hey! You're excellent! [info] 1432733007
PhoZCalvin [info] Bipolar and unable to control my jealous habits. First time posting here... My name is Calvin and I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 just recently, and have been misdiagnosed with things such as paranoid personality disorder, schizophrenia and other things in the past. During my first lasting relationship in the 8th grade, I started noticing a bit of a jealousy issue when my girlfriend and I were on the phone with my friend (who I knew my girlfriend found attractive) and while I was going to hang up she still wanted to talk to him... Which made me very nervous and suspicious. That relationship didn't go well due to those habits growing into more and more ridiculous things. Shirt is too low, she's trying to attract other guys. She hugs another guy, she wants him. She didn't exactly help me understand those issues.. However I never really accepted any help either. I was stuck in my beliefs. Many relationships were the same, one of them lasting 2 years with another bipolar girl and it was horribly toxic. The green eyes grew fierce. I hated the fact that my significant other would even find other people attractive. Even if they told me they didn't... The strangest things would bug me. I could never date someone who wasn't a virgin... It /killed/ me to hear that they have had sex before because I would constantly compare myself to them, no matter what she would say. I'm not even a virgin... I know it's horribly hypocritical to react that way. Even things like my girlfriend smoking cigarettes bothered me, because I saw it as a "bad girl thing" and that scared the shit out of me. I would never date a dirty girl. Her liking other guys photos on Facebook... Even if it was before we knew each other. "do you still find them attractive?" I'd ask. It's awful and I hate myself for even being like that. These things drive me absolute insane.. I've recently started medication, currently on 75 MG of lamictal and 40 MG of vyvanse. The girl I'm with now is wonderful... She's very supportive of me and loves me even with these issues. With her I've been the most stable... Relatively stable, that is. I still get very jealous. She's always told me she's not a dirty girl. I've been doing well at controlling my jealously (not stalking her Facebook mostly) but today didn't go so well.. I hadn't slept last night and felt like shit today. I told her about me refraining from stalking her Facebook, but she said "go ahead and look, I haven't done anything wrong, like usual" but the thing is, she doesn't have to do anything wrong for me to get jealous. I end up relapsing and browsing through.. Getting jealous, eventually leading me to going through her past statuses from years ago.. It ended up causing me to just look for as much as I can because it wasn't even hurting as much anymore. I came across a status that said "the amount of celebrities I would let have my body without second thought is insane" and immediately I panicked. Crying, shaking uncontrollably, doing everything I can to shove the thought out but again and again I'd hear it scream at me. I ended up burning my chest with a screwdriver, something I hadn't done in a while. I told her to come over to help me.. I explained I wasn't upset with her but I just needed help, but she said she didn't want to and that she no longer had any sympathy for me. It crushed me... She eventually did and not much was resolved.. I feel as if I have to push it away. Every time it crosses my mind, immediately I start flailing and shaking in a neurotic manner. I don't know how to deal with it... I have gotten better at understanding things that cause jealousy and brushing them off, but this is just too painful for me to even approach... I need to figure out what to do. I always have felt like my mind is such a scary place with so much forbidden ground. I'm afraid to even think in fear of thoughts I've repressed coming back..

chrgomez3 [info] Lamictal users Hello. I am diagnosed with bipolar two disorder. I ve been on seroquel for two months now and my doctor wants to switch me to lamictal. I ve done four failed attempts so far. At the second day taking 25 mg of lamictal i feel so empty of energy, so depressed that i had to stop. My doctor says i have to give it more time. My question is, does anyone have experienced this first reaction and had continued treatment??? [info] None [info] 1568663131
yellowslashred [info] I can't say I've ever had to deal with anything even remotely close to this situation, in any of my relationships. I do know that that losing someone you love to circumstances beyond either of your control is awful though, and I'm sorry that this is something you have to go through.I will say this: I got out of a relationship that tore my heart apart in the end. I was pretty much dropped without a word, when I had put so much into being there for her. It was miserable. In addition to dealing the revelation that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I also had this failed relationship looming overhead. I emotionally shut down. I didn't talk to really anyone about it. I didn't... feel for a while. Things seemed kind of bleak.I spent no time trying to talk to or court other girls. I spent a lot of time with my friends, and had this sort of resentment about relationships, half due to the fact my heart was broken, half due to the fact at least half of my friends were in decent relationships. When I finally did give love a shot again, it was scary. The first girl I tried dating ended up catching on quick that I was becoming attached to her. We decided against dating because we were too good of friends, and she was a little emotionally unavailable. The next girl kind of pushed and pulled me away constantly, and I never knew where I stood with her. Eventually, it came to a head and I gave up on her.About three weeks later, I started seeing my current girlfriend, who I have been dating for four years now and plan on spending the rest of my life with.Love is confusing. Love is painful. Love is the most beautiful feeling in the world. Talk to this girl you love. Don't wait until the last minute to try and find closure or understanding. If things don't work out, it'll be okay. Things will be rough for a while, but you'll come out of it as a stronger and more knowledgeable person. Don't give up on love. Here's a [song for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEYWK5HQPf4). It might catch you in the feels, but it might help. [info] the devil and god are fidget spinning inside me [info] 1497860670

rightasrain0919 [info] Help Dating with Mental Illness I’ve been single for a few months. I’m considering getting back into the dating pool, but honestly it scares the hell out of me. While I was with my ex-boyfriend I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II,  PTSD, and ADHD. It’s taken about two years to get everything under control with meds, therapy, and lifestyle changes. My personality is TOTALLY different now than what it was “before” and I have to maintain some routines in order to keep my mental health in check. I know that I’ll have to have “the talk” about my condition with any potential longer than short-term partner. I’m left with the feeling that, even though I want to share my life with a partner, that my life as it is and will be may be too much of a burden. I’m also afraid of the stigma surrounding less well-known mental illnesses like bipolar disorder. Many people think it’s the same thing as schizophrenia.Should I even try to start dating? Where should I start? What’s the appropriate time to have “the talk”? Please help me, kind internet strangers. [info] None [info] 1560022604
zkushlvn [info] I have this problem and it is by far my worst enemy.  Until I was diagnosed with bipolar I just thought I was a sex addict.  I mean come on, sex with random people, whether meeting them at a bar or online frequently.  I could not tell you the number of sexual partners I have had and I don't want to know.  Even medicated it is still something I struggle with and given my preferred sexual style (Dom/sub) it is even harder since it seems like a double ended sword for me of conquest and satisfaction through sex alone.  I always hated myself later on but could not and still cannot stop.  I have been somewhat successful lately but still I crave it.  While medicated I am able to keep to porn and just reading/fantasizing but it is still a thorn in the side I am unable to keep in check.  For resisting, if I can, I have a support person I can call.  My wife is amazing and I am able to talk to her about it.  It is weird to tell your wife you are craving sex and want to fuck each woman you see etc etc but being able to talk about it and know that she will relieve my issue later that day is such a weight off the shoulders.  I wish I could be more helpful for ideas but others have said what else works.  Channeling your energy to something else which takes time.  Mostly is writing my ideas down if I have nothing else.  It clears the mind, even if it is an hour session or just sexual babble that doesn't make sense but hey it kept me from cheating on my wife or fucking some random person.

RaptorGoRawr [info] My first semester in college I was you. I slept all the time, had no friends, and was failing EVERY class. I would leave my room, go get food to go from the cafeteria and come back to my room. I wanted zero interaction. I had no motivation to do anything, even showering was a chore. I told my parents.... the parents that had slaved away for years to give me everything they could, the ones who put themselves in debt for my private school tuition. You know what they did? They were confused and hurt at first but they helped me get help. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and insomnia. I went back the next semester, medicated, in therapy, and determined.   I discussed it with my RA who became an ear and an accountability partner.  She made sure I stayed med compliant, got to my appointments and connected me with some really great girls in my dorm who became great friends. Your RA is there to help you, let them!No matter what you chose to do about school, having your parents in your corner makes all the difference.  [info] None [info] 1368184048
lovingtype [info] Got diagnosed as bipolar but idk if I am My friend and I were talking and I mentioned how I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past by a psychiatrist but didn’t believe that I have it since I have did so it’s kind of hard to know if some behaviors was bc we’re bipolar or it was an atler. I’m not rlly sure what a manic episode is or what its like to have it but I made a comment that in the past my previous host felt emotions very strongly where one time she dropped a cooking while crossing the street and got genuinely upset to where she screamed and wanted to cry and he said that sounds like we’re bipolar. When I hear about mania I see a lot of it is people talking about how they feel great in the moment but I cant rlly remember tht happening ourselves. Ive had times where I’ve became restless and started acting out doing a lot of risky things I shouldnt have and lashed out and felt super out of it and not myself but never had those moments I felt elated or rlly super happy so idk if those would rlly b a manic episode. I also remember there was a time where our prev host felt super on edge and like everyone was watching her or was out to get her. She was pretty out of touch and stopped going to school and even though rationally it didnt make any sense at all and people tried to explain that to her she’d just get upset because she knew they were right but she fully believed in it the same and didnt know how to stop. Eventually she came out of it a few months later but idk of thats an episode or trauma. Theres also times where I’ll rlly get into smthing like games to where I’ll focus on it soley and forget abt everything like eating and sleeping and my friend told me an episode can b like that but I think thats bc I'm autistic and I’m just super focused on the thing. So idk if I really am bipolar or not bc my therapist and I have never rlly talked abt it, maybe she did with the previous host but Ive been focused on a lot of other things in life but I think I wanna bring it up to her.

losangeldust [info] my last psychosis episode lasted two years. i am diagnosed with bipolar schizo affective. i will tell you the thinking your on tv show or won a reality game show or something and then thinking everyone else in the neighborhood is in on it can turn ugly given enough time. you should seek help. it came out in me in my late twenties. whats happening is there is probably something in your life or environment that is stressing your ego... so your ego is over inflating to compensate for something which in turn makes it so your dream world can turn into a real world. your important my friend but not important enough to have a reality tv show about you and your family. it may be hard to hear that while having an episode because delusions are real to those experiencing them. you are aware of being trapped on the tv set make sure you use your rational mind to get you off the set. it can get a lot worse like when the tv starts interacting with you.

bipolar2boogaloo [info] Lamictal and Effexor XR; physical, mental, emotional health is crap, sick of feeling like this, sick of not knowing what to do Effexor XR and Lamictal; Sick of my life right now, sick of my meds, sick of not knowing what to dohi, 32f new to this sub. i’m reaching out for help/someone to relate to. here’s my deal:i currently take 150mg Effexor XR and Lamictal 100mg each once a day. i’ve been on these for a little over two years now. i’ve noticed my energy levels slowly decrease to the point i’m not nearly as active as i used to be, which has taken a toll on my weight (gained about 30lbs) and my mental/emotional health. i find it difficult to even get up and do something for my health. my sugar/junk food intake has also increased which i’m sure plays a role in my weight gain. i have dealt with constipation on these meds consistently and it drives me insane, i can’t seem to regulate my body and it’s so discouraging. i notice on the very rare occasion that i don’t take my meds (i take them at night before bed) i wake up and feel really intense side effects (everything is more colorful and vibrant but at the same time surreal and blurry, i feel twitchy and very sensitive to the touch, my skin feels like it has thousands of tiny needles poking it) and suddenly i’m pooping like there’s no tomorrow. amidst these crazy side effects and finally being able to poop, i find myself questioning whether or not i even need to take these meds anymore. once i take the meds after i forget the night before, i have a crying spell, my body “comes down” from those side effects, i feel any kind of emotion i’m having fade away again, and then it’s back to being constipated, unmotivated, apathetic, life isn’t as colorful, etc. oh, and my periods have never been more irregular and difficult to manage in my entire life. i will go three months without one sometimes and it’s hell, both for me and my current boyfriend.i started on Effexor in the midst of an extremely difficult relationship. Lamictal came a year later when i noticed i would have angry outbursts closer to my period.sorry about the long post. i just want to be active again, lose this weight, feel happier about life, even if that means experiencing highs and lows that may or may not be manic. i am diagnosed with bipolar II/major depressive disorder. TL;DR: effexor xr 150mg and lamictal 100mg for two years, doesn’t seem to be making my life any better, feeling more like shit physically/mentally/emotionally than i have in a long time. considering weaning off meds, looking to hear others’ experiences.

calculust_ [info] How does schizophrenia feel on light medication? I was diagnosed with bipolar II about a year ago. At that point, I didn’t know I was having psychotic symptoms like hearing voices because they never talked to me. I never told my doctor this because it went away when I started medication. Now, I think I was starting to develop schizophrenia and going on antipsychotics for the bipolar II stopped me from developing it further. However, I still have slight auditory hallucinations like I feel like I can hear electro magnetic waves or sometimes I hear music that isn’t playing. I am extremely paranoid and last night I stayed up until 4 in the morning because I was convinced there was a shadow man in my kitchen waiting for me to fall asleep so he could kill me with a dagger and telling anyone this was happening would make him do it while I was awake. I never actually saw him though. I also have depersonalization all the time like it never goes away. I’m told that my ideas are often told in ways that don’t make sense to the people around me and I have the feeling this isn’t the real world and it is actually a hell created just for me because I did something awful in a past life. When I see coincidences, I see them as glitches in the plan set out for my torture. I don’t think about this often unless I am in a very low mood which happens 2-3 days per week. I also have deja vu moments almost every day. There were other things going on before I was on medication too but I feel like this post is already too long. I was wondering if people who were on lighter doses of medication felt similar to how I’m feeling and if not, how do you feel? I’m going to see my therapist on Monday and I don’t want to ask him if I’m schizophrenic if I’m clearly not to people who know more about it than I do. Tl:dr I might have been misdiagnosed as bipolar so I’m on antipsychotics already. How does schizophrenia feel on lower doses of medication? [info] None [info] 1512567202

xxola [info] * I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2013 and I believed it right away due to my ebbing and flowing depressive episodes that came in cyclical manners.* I was recently rediagnosed with type 1 due to an apparent manic episode, and to be honest I still don't honestly believe it. I'm going along with it and saying that I am because I feel like I'll get in more trouble if I don't agree to it, but in actuality I don't feel like what happened was as big of a deal as everyone said it was. I talk fast naturally and always have, I have a loud voice that carries *even when I'm depressed*, and the person I screamed at was a teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with me and was treating me unfairly in the classroom. It's hard to believe in a disorder when the situation was nonstandard but I have to just do what everyone says and take my meds even if I don't agree because I don't want to get in any more trouble. I just want to go to school and live quietly. [info] BP1, Mixed episodes, rapid cycling [info] 1462082535
DrAnalBeads [info] Restart/new beginnings So this is gonna be a happy post. I derailed my life in my teens and did a  bunch of drugs instead of studying like a good boy, because i felt like the only person who cared about me (my mother), didn't care if I succeeded... there were many other reasons too, but i really don't want to go too deep here. Anyway I just passed my last exam for my year 12 equivalence with honours, which is something I never thought I'd live long enough to do (I'm 21), let alone be strong enough to do. I've been practicing mindfulness and I've been engaged in DBT for a while now and I can't express the difference it has made for me. Up until recently I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2, which felt like a life sentence. I feel like I've been given a second chance at success... and in a way i feel like I gave it to myself. Now I know my success is my responsibility! And I truly believe that with hard work I can achieve what I want to, and become the person I've always wanted to be. Thank you subreddit BPD... you helped me see i was not alone.

Melbees [info] So I'm assuming that you're in the US, so I will speak to that with my experience. I have been in college for almost 8 years (undergrad + grad) and I have been off my parents insurance for about 5 years, which put me on school insurance. I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago, and have been to two schools on opposite sides of the country, and talked about similar things with friends at other schools and it seems to be almost the same everywhere.Usually your school offers counseling services for "free" (i.e. you've already paid a fee for them), and along with that comes either a nurse practitioner who can prescribe medication or a psychiatrist who you might have to pay a small fee to see (I pay 10 dollars per half hour to talk to mine). Since you have a history of taking the meds they'll immediately prescribe you on the same meds. They are happy to do this long term, I've only ever gone to nurse practioners and the school psychiatrist for the entire 4 years since my diagnoses. Now for the coverage in medication: does your medication come in generic? That would help bring down the cost immensely. Also your school insurance (which may be pricey compared relative to the fact there's not much in it) will most likely cover at least some of your medication. Is it possible for you to switch to a medication that comes in a generic? Honestly for me, I told them to not even bother with medications I can't afford so they put me on lamictal which has a 10-15 dollar generic. If nothing else, my first NP recommended to shop around at pharmacies (the school pharm usually gives a discount if you are a student/ have student insurance) and she even recommended to look at canadian pharmacies which she was willing to send a prescription to. Most medical care providors (especially with mental health) just want to see you be well, and understand that costs are very much a factor when you are in college. Hope that helps, and PM me if you have any questions... I've been doing this for some time. [info] None [info] 1364579047
heathermlavoie [info] Don't lose hope. I was diagnosed with bipolar and brought up BPD with my psychiatrist, he said while I may have some symptoms of BPD, he didn't think I had it. So he's continuing to treat the bipolar with different medications (none have really worked so far) while I try to practice mindfulness and all that DBT kind of stuff on my own. I really recommend reading books on BPD and reading other people's experiences. It helps me feel less alone. In terms of relationships, they're going to be hard and painful, and trust will never come easy. I'm very sorry you're going through a breakup, letting go is always very hard for me. But you know you can be better, you said it yourself. Try to be mindful of what did and didn't work in the relationship so that you can grow from it.  [info] emotional rollercoaster [info] 1549299860

eilletane [info] Really like this question. You've started a very interesting conversation. Especially at this time when most of the working adults were raised by traditional and conservation parents.   &amp;nbsp;  For myself, I don't intend to have kids. And I do think this is due to my upbringing.   &amp;nbsp;  Quick life story:   Divorced parents, father was emotionally and physically abusive to my sister, my mom and me. Lived with my mother for most of my life. She's very calculative and paranoid. Being the younger and "surprise" child, I always had to work to get attention from my mom. Sis was book smart, I was street smart. But we all know that doesn't matter in Singapore.  &amp;nbsp;  Mother adopted some emotional and physical abuse parenting from dad. I was rebellious because I wanted attention and I was bad at school. Mom and I had a really abusive relationship till i was 17 when I was diagnosed with bipolar after a psychotic episode. After that, things calmed down a bit and we understood each other much more.  I moved out, with much reluctance from my mother. (Again another violent argument) and after things died down, everything soared real high up. We became friends.   &amp;nbsp;  On the other side is my elder sister. Brought up by the same parent, she was a very obedient and smart child. However, she never got to the rebellious stage, till she was an adult. And as of currently, her r/s with mom is quite terrible.   &amp;nbsp;  I'm grateful for all that has happened. It made me a better person. All that ugliness and violence bonded my mother and I in a way I never thought existed. However, I would never want that to ever happen between myself and my children.  [info] None [info] 1522668991
ErebosGR [info] Araragi mentioned that he went through a depressive period in middle school or earlier in high school IIRC. And he seems hypomanic in most of his encounters with the other female characters (talkativeness, distractibility, restlessness, disinhibition, euphoria, hypersexuality etc.).Senjougahara could have suffered from PTSD because of her sexual assault that subsequently could have triggered her eating disorder, but I didn't see any symptoms of PTSD in the present.

DrRobotniksMachine [info] When I was diagnosed with bpd I didn't think much of it because I didn't really know much about it. When I was diagnosed with bipolar I was devestated because that's what my abuser had. Through both of these diagnoses they tried to discuss a trauma diagnosis as well which I was not ready for. Then a few years later bipolar was scrapped and replaced with cptsd, which I feel satisfied with. I think people seek a diagnosis to validate their experiences but I think sometimes it can be detrimental. It's easy to read a pattern of behaviour on the Internet and adopt it as your own if you are impressionable.

However, (like I said) I only started reading these books books because they were 'apparently finished' and merely needed to be revised/edited. Why am I considered in such low regard because I believed what he said at the beginning? But it's been 6 years with no foreseeable release date. I feel as though I was swindled. This is the typical response everyone gets when they voice their dismay. I'm very familiar with mental health issues, I've been diagnosed with bipolar since 2003. I have my ups and downs, but I've always done my job. I just question the fact that he can come out with multiple novellas, but can't finish the main course. Maybe he doesn't have the talent to finish the book properly. He does interact with his fans, but to no regard. I watched his Q&amp;A last week and he gave us nothing but how to pronounce words in the book.  [info] None [info] 1486670426
recoveringPSteacher [info] Yeah, I agree with this. I’m from a rural area. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1998. I was scared as shit to tell anyone — my parents thought it could be prayed away or just ignored it all together (I was in college). While there’s still a stigma associated with mental illness, I don’t feel like I have to “hide” my diagnosis. I teach high school and have even shared my diagnosis with my students in an effort to remove shame and stigma. My students (and their parents) have always been very supportive, and it often opens a dialogue with students who suffer from their own mental illnesses. [info] None [info] 1570149371

warmgreenhatgirl [info] Mom, I have bipolar disorder and my delusions are hurting my marriage. Mom, I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and I've been trying my best to work though myself and realize what is a symptom and what is the "real" me. I'm waiting in medication because my doctor said I need genetic testing and I don't have the money for that right now, but I'm very willing and open to medicine.. I don't want to live like this.So, here's what I needed to talk to you about momma. Im having all sorts of delusions that relate to my husband and they HURT so bad, but I was hoping that if I wrote them down it would get better- that works for a little while, maybe two hours? Do you think that it would be okay for me to share what I wrote down with my husband so that I might have a chance of feeling better, because he would show me how wrong I am? My other worry is that it would just hurt his feelings to know what my mind has dreamed up concerning him. (I'm having paranoid delusions about him and a co-worker of his) and he would pull farther away from me than he did before we realized my illness and started to talk about stuff more.My illness isn't an excuse but a cause of these thoughts, and I've already wounded my husband emotionally and I feel terrible for it, but I'm trying my best to work though and get better- as much as I can while I wait on my medication anyway.

It took me forever to admit to myself that I needed professional help and I'm so proud of you knowing yourself well enough to understand that the way you're feeling is not ok and that you could use some help.  I don't really have any practical suggestions on how to deal with the system, but I really do hope that you find a doctor and that eventually you will get better.. stay strong.

_AquaFractalyne_ [info] LSD has been studied in highly controlled clinical settings with professional psychiatric researchers. Doing LSD at your house is completely different (I'm speaking from experience). Psychedelics are not going to help you cure yourself, and it took me years to realize that self-medicating was only making things worse for me. 7 years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I never saw that coming! Tripping alone will never be a replacement for getting professional help. I do hope that one day it could be a part of that process, though, because DMT and Psilocybin have greatly enriched my life.Btw, Not arguing with you [info] None [info] 1509024134
dont_like_skittles [info] Thank you :)I was diagnosed with bipolar back in 2011, so I've been through lots of meds and doctors. My meds for that are working well for some time.

floydini13 [info] Well, I know I can't control anyone else's feelings, that's up to them.  As far as relating to other people, the hard part for me is to control my reactions to what they are doing or saying.  I think that is something everyone has to work on, whether they are bipolar or not.I don't think I have ever been able to truly control my personality/behavior or decide when I'm going to be happy, sad, etc...  Instead, what I used to do was control what I showed to everyone else when inside it was a completely different story.  When my facade fell apart enough that I could not lie to myself or anyone else, I was diagnosed with bipolar and started medication that has helped me gain real control  instead of covering up.  It doesn't work perfectly, i still have wild rides up and down but at least I have help now and that frees up some time to enjoy life more instead of using all my energy hiding and being afraid that other people will notice that I'm not "normal"I have had a rough time for a while now and started to see a different dr and therapist and started a new med and things are actually getting better.  Just this week, my therapist said he wants me to become more aware of the signs of different cycles because I have been kind of just riding along with it.So, here is another new thing to work on and I guess it will help me become even more in charge of my own actions.I know what you mean about having different feelings toward people depending on what day it is!

asilentsound [info] Eugenics is the selection against certain traits on the basis that one expects them to be passed on genetically. Granted, I'm in favor of evidence-based eugenics (which, by the way, is already widely practiced in the US without much hubbub), but there is a distinction between psychological screening to protecting children and eugenics. For this to be a eugenic policy, those with a genetic predisposition to mental illness would not be allowed to reproduce regardless of their treatment status. As I have repeatedly made clear, this is not what I have advocated.For example, CPS will remove children from home situations which are particularly unhealthy. Is this eugenics? Of course not (I would think), yet the difference between this and mental health screenings is simply a matter of degree. My proposal is simply a more exacting and preemptive version of policies already in place.In regard to the targeting of minorities, I would offer a few points. Firstly, I am a member of such a minority. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and before I finally received proper treatment it would have been immensely unethical to entrust a child into my care. I have yet to meet anyone with a diagnosed mental illness who was remotely fit to raise children. Second, much of my extended family suffers from various mental illnesses, so I am similarly familiar with the damage an ill person can inflict on a child's psyche. As far as this being a policy which targets a "minority", I think you underestimate just how widespread the sort of parental unfitness I described actually is. If anything, this would be a policy which targets a large plurality or nearly a majority, forcing them to receive treatment before having children.  [info] None [info] 1473116618
HeathenMama541 [info] I can't comment on the bread so I'm going to reply to you directly. Before I was diagnosed with bipolar and medicated, my cycles were so drastic that it affected every aspect of my life. My job, my parenting, my relationship. I went on a very emotionally violent downward spiral over the summer and finally brought it all up to my psychiatrist who put me on 20 mg of celexa (citalopram) a day, and my life has been significantly better ever since. I'm calmer, more rational and level headed, and the paranoia has completely been eliminated from my psyche. I strongly suggest taking the steps towards medication. Mental health is just as important as physical health. We wouldn't expect a diabetic to go without insulin, why would we expect ourselves to go without medications that help us with our mental health?  [info] None [info] 1482023888
mbok_jamu [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar and OCD in 2007, but the first time I went to psychiatrist was in 2005. I often faint at school and there were times when I was so angry, I slapped my friends for a very simple problem. My teacher sent a letter to my dad, asked him to take me to the doctor. So he took me to the doctor and the doctor said there must be something wrong with my heart, he says I've got lemah jantung and that's what makes me often faint. But when we went to a cardiologist, he says I'm fine and recommend me to visit a psychiatrist instead. My dad was confused, but we went to the psychiatrist anyway. I don't know what the doctor said at that time, I went with my dad, so the doctor told the diagnosis to my dad. They didn't tell me anything about it, but I remember my dad looks angry. On our way home, he told me he couldn't believe he just took his daughter to the psychiatrist and he says I'm an attention whore, I made up all these things just to get attention. It breaks my heart. I feel offended. I know there must be something wrong with me.My parents are conservative. For them, there is no such thing as mental disorder, if someone should be treated by a psychiatrist, then that person is crazy. Nggak ada yang namanya dateng ke psikiater cuma buat konsultasi doang, nggak ada yang namanya stress, depresi, atau apalah, kalo udah gila ya gila aja. They believe they raised me well, while in fact, they don't. My dad is an authoritarian, when he talks, no one can talk. Nggak ada yang namanya berpendapat, karena buat dia itu namanya membangkang. So that's why I always hide what I'm feeling inside. I was so quiet. There are so many things I wanna tell my parents that they're wrong, but I have no courage to say that. When I entered the university, I started to collect some money to go to the psychiatrist. Finally, I knew what's wrong with me. The doctor said I  have bipolar disorder and OCD. That's why I can't control my mood and anger, I also speak in repetitive form, I often repeat what I've said and done. I feel relieved. I have a disorder and it's not normal, but at least now I know how to deal with it.What you should do right now is find a person that you can trust, a person who will listen to anything you're saying, because I never had that person, I chose to keep it all in my head, until it explodes. Don't wait until you're explode. Find a help. [info] Neng, papa kamu tukang komputer ya? Muka Neng perlu diedit. [info] 1400823522
letitfckingsnow [info] Misdiagnosis with other mental illnesses? Has anyone been diagnosed with other mental illnesses and had to deal with the question of comorbidity, or whether it’s all due to PMDD? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 3 years ago. I’m obviously not asking for diagnostic advice because it would take forever to type out (and you’re not doctors), but essentially I’m looking back and my symptoms started right after I went on birth control — and though I didn’t track them exactly, I know a lot of my “episodes” would occur about a month apart. When I’ve been off that birth control, I still have PMDD symptoms, but it was like the pill exacerbated it. I’ve also been diagnosed with PMDD but never by someone who thought to discriminate between them, if that makes sense. I know now that I don’t react well to hormones (at least the wrong ones), but I’m doubting that I even have bipolar, as the meds and therapy really never helped me. I definitely experienced some bipolar-like symptoms but I don’t know if I have it independently of PMDD, if that makes sense. Has anyone dealt with something similar? What were your experiences?

Kiwi150 [info] ~5 years ago I was making a left onto Ehrlich from Dale Mabry and got hit head on by a lady on her cell phone who ran the red light she had. Because of this I have 3 major injuries in my back that leave me in pretty much constant pain (it only stops hurting *on occasion* when I shower or sleep). The doctors I saw got me loaded up on prescription pain killers, I was addicted in no time flat and it led to me committing some crimes. In addition to this, around the same time, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which I have to take a medicine that is basically destroying my liver slowly over time. 5 years ago a doctor told me I would need to start using a device to assist my walking (a cane). I have since left that doctor. After realizing what prescriptions like Opana, Nucynta, Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycontin or Ultram were doing to me, I stopped taking medicine for my back other than some "extra-strength" naproxen that does nothing for me. The medication for my Bipolar disorder also has a few unpleasant side-effects along with the liver damage like appetite loss (I only actually *feel* like eating maybe once a day, so I drink meal replacement shakes to remain nourished), stomach/abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting.So what do you think I do to take care of that intolerable pain, nausea, and appetite loss?I support the legalization of medical marijuana because it makes my life quite a bit more bearable.If it is legalized here in FL, all I can hope to forsee is that others' lives will be made more bearable by it.

kratomhugger [info] After Habitually Taking Medication For Nine Years I wouldn’t call myself anti-psychiatry, but maybe you guys can help me, because your struggles seem similar to my own. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder many years ago, and took several drugs around the clock for it, daily. In November, my very oppressive symptoms went away and I was able to stop taking my medications. These symptoms have not returned, but I cannot shake the idea that I should be “taking something,” even when the slightest thing goes wrong. I seem to have conditioned myself to take medication. I actually refilled one of my old scripts- despite that I don’t need it- just to fulfill this desire I have to take a pill. Is there a way out of this?

midnight9383 [info] I’m strong in that I don’t get angry. When I do, I use it to my advantage. TW: sexual abuse This is half rant, half proud of myself.I’ve had a rough life, in some ways. In other ways, not so much. I guess I’ve been through a lot, but I consider myself lucky and strong more than anything.Growing up was tough with autism. I had no friends. I couldn’t make friends. People thought I was weird or aloof. I felt like a freak, as someone who is self aware despite the autism. I still have numerous sensory issues—but I work in social jobs and am paying my way through college.My father was somewhat abusive. Definitely a narcissist. Emotionally you were never good enough. Physical abuse happened too on occasion. He cheated on my mother for 15 years  and gave her herpes. He dragged me up the stairs by my hair or beat me until my ass was blue as a kid. No matter what you did, you were always a failure.At age 11 an older guy started sexually abusing me. Happened til I was 13. When he committed suicide when I was 14, I felt nothing.At age 15 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would disrupt class when hypomanic. As a female at age 15 of course I had a high sex drive but it would be to the point I had female “blue balls” for days on end. Other times I was so depressed I’d self harm and threaten suicide. The autism didn’t help. If I got upset or had a meltdown I’d bang my head against the wall or scratch up my face. I still have scars.When I was 19 I was raped. The trauma caused me to drop out of college. I didn’t tell a soul for three months. When I did, my parents basically told me i fucked up by dropping out. I’d have to pay my way through school now.At age 20 I had my first psychotic break. Since then I’ve been hospitalized once and in outpatient a few times.And yet... I’m still here. I’m not angry about my lot in life. Some people justify it by saying “others have it worse” and that is absolutely true. It could *always* be worse. That brings me no comfort however. I think, it could always get better.I never allowed myself to be angry for getting raped. I was sad, and numb. Until I realized, fuck, MY LIFE SUCKS AND IT ISNT FAIR. And I was pissed off for a few weeks. I mean, bloody pissed. This was three years after I was raped. Years after my dad was abusive. Years after I became “less socially awkward”. But I was ANGRY.Sometimes people use anger as an excuse. I’m angry—so I’ll drink myself to death, or hate others, or be an asshole. I used anger as spite. I will persevere. I will do well despite my trials. I will be level headed.Despite the times I scratched my face as a kid. Despite the times I was abused. Despite everything. I won’t dwell on it anymore.This is me letting go. [info] None [info] 1547055694

The big problem is I am now having a lot of trouble concentrating in uni. My psychiatrist thinks it's me being depressed and maybe he is right but I'm not unhappy or sedate, it feels more like ADHD. I looked into adderal and then found out about modafinil. Despite the bipolar research do psychiatrist prescribe modafinil for bipolar in Australia and are they even allowed to?Thanks to anyone who can help [info] None [info] 1370149290
LadySerenity [info] In my freshman year of college, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and panic disorder. I immediately began the arduous process of trying different medications before finding the right one. Unfortunately, unless your side effects are really severe, you have to wait at least 3 months before you know for sure if the medication is a good fit. During the spring semester, I tried a new antidepressant. The stuff made me a fucking zombie. When I walked to class, it felt like my feet were cinderblocks and I had trouble starting awake in my classes. I was also constantly nauseous. Towards the end of the semester, my pre-Calc professor called me out in front of the entire class for how arrogant I was to skip the homework and try to take the exams anyway. He used me as an example of what not to do. I had a talk with him privately and mentioned that the Dean of Students was aware of my situation. He was mortified and publicly apologized the next day in class. I ultimately passed the class with a C, but damn did I want to drop his class.I took the next semester off and got myself sorted out. Once stable, I took Calculus and got an A. Even so, I still cringe when I remember that day in class. [info] None [info] 1559130682
joshman108 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar I but that diagnosis doesn't fit in the sense that my manic episodes are quite short, never more than minutes of extreme-ness (though a less extreme episode lasts much longer). Of course I wouldn't automatically discredit being bipolar for two reasons. The first of which is that it's nice to have an explanation for why you feel the way that you do. The second is that if you ARE bipolar then there is a real chance that having that understand would help mitigate some potentially dangerous choices you may otherwise make because you wouldn't be aware that anything unusual was happening in your body (which basically happens to every bipolar person until they gain a sense of awareness).

Drugs_are_awesome [info] Ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 ive been convinced sex hormones play a sizable role. Estradiol, testosterone, dht, shbg all of them have effects in the brain. High levels of DHT are known to increase glutamate which is what most BP drugs try to inhibit (ie lamictal). And estradiol is known to be neuroprotective which is why fewer women get degenerative brain diseases. Unfortunately no doctors test hormones in bipolar but I can say that going on TRT and having my hormones balanced has eliminated a lot of the symptoms. Are sex hormones the end all be all of bipolar? No. But I believe having them balanced can help a lot.  [info] None [info] 1548425631

shrugkey [info] Can't stop kicking my leg? Is this a side effect of Latuda I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and given a drug called Latuda. When I started taking the larger dose I started getting this weird urge to move around and tap my feet. Trying to sit still feels unbearable, like there's electricity under my skin compelling me to MOVE. I called the doctor and he told me to stop taking it until I see him next week.&amp;#x200B;Is this a common experience?  Does anyone know what could be going on?

brinkofhumor [info] Don't know if my Girlfriend cheated on me, need your opinion.  Okay, so this summer my gf was working as an intern in MA, while I was in ohio. One night she went out drinking (which im fine with) and sent me a text saying "Im so sorry, I fucked up, Im so sorry". She told me afterwords that it was just because seh got a little more drunk than she meant to. Fast Foward to a few weeks ago, wehere she told me that some guy tried to kiss her at same party. I was pretty upset, because she waited so long, but I told her you did the right thing for telling me. I foudn the guy on facebook, and sent him a "Your an asshole" message, and he sent one saying "Dude she kissed me back"So, I go kinda stir crazy. I know her facebook pw, and i know its wrong but I log in to see if there was anything said. I find her conversation with a friend, saying how she kissed him when she was drunk. I confront her with this, and she said she only told her that to make the story more dramatic, because the almost kiss kinda shook her off...I think thats bullshit, and that something happened, shes mad at me for not trusting her, and im mad at her for being deceptive.Edit-7:45 Got this on facebook, then we talked on the phone ...This summer, while we were on the outs with each other, Josh did show interest in me, but I refused him. While we eventually did hang out with each other, it didn’t turn into anything. What I told Jill was true. However, this is very different from what your other girlfriends did. I still love you, and don’t want to be with Josh, but I can’t be with you right now. Hanging out with him showed me that I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be together. I just want to be independent. Your emotional ups and downs are, I believe, causing you to mistreat me. I don’t want to be with anyone else, but we can’t be together right now. I’m sorry...(I was diagnosed with bipolar earlier in the summer. also had the worst luck see http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jh8y1/request_really_really_long_readi_have_had_the/)EDIT-7:37 8/24Just found out she fucked him.

Bpshthrow [info] Just want to vent, not necessarily looking for sympathy [Trigger Warning] Hello all. Ever since I've been diagnosed with bipolar I've struggled with suicidal and homicidal urges. The suicidal urges are mild at worst but occasionally the homicidal urges get completely out of control. They will range from murder of strangers, to loved ones, to mass murder. I have bern able to keep things under control for a while. The first time I had these thoughts I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I've been medicated for about a year now, on several different mixtures of drugs, but eventually these homicidal urges pop back up and rehospitalize me. As of late these thoughts have increased and although they are strong, they're not the strongest they've ever been. I've been contemplating suicide so that I won't hurt anyone else. I would go back to the hospital now, but having gone 3 times in less than a year I'm nearly financially crippled and I think I would be fired from my job if I left again. Like I said, I'm not looking for sympathy, just needed to vent. I sometimes feel like it would be easy to overcome these urges, but I'm worried about what might happen if I do spiral out of control and hurt someone. I've looked into permanent psychiatric hospitals but I don't think that's something that's even a possibility. Thank you for listening and sorry for the dreary confession.

I don't want to moan and bitch, I'm just trying to reason with myself through the magic of reddit. is my life really worth living? My pills are produced domestically, meaning that they're shit.

bostonstapler [info] I (25M) think I struggle with codependency I need some advice Hey all so I'll try to explain this as best as I can. I was diagnosed with bipolarism when I was 18. I didn't have a "bad" childhood, but I did have emotionally unavailable parents and I think because of the combination of things I have developed codependency in relationships. Looking back at all my past relationships I have started to notice a trend. I either completely ignore my partner or am not emotional with them at all and have struggles connecting with them despite their best efforts and how much they would do for me. Or on the flip side, I try to take care of them entirely, and just do everything in my power to make sure they're okay. I like to spend as much time as humanly possible with them and I get upset if they cant follow through with some of the stuff they had said. It's like I became instantly attached and I become super stressed out because I'm afraid they'll leave or that I'm not good enough.&amp;#x200B;Which brings us to now, I started dating a beautiful woman and have noticed that i've started these patterns. She's currently in rehab in recovery trying to get better for alcoholism which I am immensely proud of her for. But she has a son and soon she will be busy taking care of him and working. So I am worried that I might go full self destructive and become the absolute worst thing for her.&amp;#x200B;Is there any advice any of you can give me to help break my codependency cycle, and be the man that she deserves without breaking myself emotionally or mentally?

TrisiBB [info] My parents aren't helping I'm 23 and ever since I told my parents that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, they've started treating me like a psychopath. They're constantly trying to make me talk about it and telling me that everything I do is detrimental (i.e. keeping to myself, crying, smoking (weed), even sleeping! like wtf?). I honestly feel like they're making things worse and ignoring all the good things about me like the fact that I have a good job, I'm becoming more and more healthy (going to the gym, eating right), I'm always on top of my meds and seeing my doctor regularly.

psilonox [info] Im not manic or depressed. What gives? A little back story: I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the age of 20 and im 32 now. I have been prescribed tons of different types of medication and the only thing I thought worked was a combination of xanax and adderall (my comment history is mostly super cringe worthy manic rants.)I quit my extremely high dose of xanax about a year ago (it was hell and almost killed me.) I haven't been medication compliant for years but I decided to just stop taking all medication other than my medical marijuana. What's weird to me is I don't feel depressed and I have no symptoms of mania. I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenic type. I have no symptoms of schitzophrenia either. Is it possible to 'grow out' of serious psychiatric disorders? At my worst I had chosen to be homeless and was thinking i was working for the government. Obviously I was/am schizophrenic.

But then I was able to keep it 'subdued' and stayed in a rather consistent hypomanic state, which is why it was largely undetected. So let's say when you hear an idea that you can work off of, the synaptic firings and establishment of new neural connections (inducing that "aha!" moment) could be hypomania, which may affect your normal cycle.

EchoInTheRoom [info] Actually, I am 32. I worked a good job for 5 years and saved 0 dollars. I should also note I suffer from bipolar disorder. Spending money is one of those things that gives me immediate gratification. If I made $1800 I spent $2000. I wound up burying myself in a couple thousand dollars worth of debt. I have been back working and have saved a couple thousand dollars. But I've been working very, very hard on cleaning up my debt. It is a big life lesson. Now I can swipe my card without fear of it being declined. Creditors have all stopped harassing me for money. Learning how to save money and be financially responsible is one of the harder things I have ever done. Lately when I want to spend money I do something productive like putting gas in my tank or go get a $2 coffee. Money has always been a mystery as well, I never learned how to save, then once I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder things went REALLY downhill. I wish I could say I was 18, but no, I am not. A buddy of mine told me a couple weeks ago to look into NYAB. I didn't, then he again recommended it to me. Now I look forward to getting my paycheck and budgeting everything. I check NYAB daily and if I plan on going out to buy something I check my spending money envelope. I am getting better, but it will take time and some discipline to really crack down... but Rome was not built in a day. [info] None [info] 1497093042
nobodyoxas [info] Bipolar and Bottoming Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar, but I feel like my diagnosis shouldn't mean I can't have a meaningful relationship with somebody. So, this has never really been a problem until I recently was put on antipsychotics, but I cannot get it up at all. It feels like my libido has dropped entirely, but I know how important sex is for a healthy relationship. I used to be a top but since I can't now, I have to get used to bottoming. My issue is that recently I've discovered I don't really like the feeling of being fucked... so does this mean I'm cursed to live alone because of my illness?

FalseSelf24 [info] Wondering if my diagnosis is accurate Several years ago, I had a severe mental break from several areas of my life collapsing all at once.  At one point, I triggered mania for the first time.  I didn't know what it was at the time.This midlife crisis (and that is an understatement) continued because I just couldn't accept reality.  I kept acting out.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, then 1.  I kept acting out.  Sometimes I refused treatment.  Sometimes I refused to cooperate.  I kept acting out.  I would force myself into situations that would trigger the mania.  Not so much because I enjoyed it but because I had to figure out what this was.Eventually when I was manic, I started to have delusional thoughts.  I had a few instances where I didn't see things exactly how they were.   I didn't have any vivid hallucinations that I've envisioned them to be.  Mostly delusional thoughts that were only present with the mania.  Now its 4 years later.  I'm properly medicated, and I haven't had mania once in all this time.  I haven't had a single delusion or hallucination. Very seldomly I have very mild bouts of paranoia (always about work and never last more than one day because I confront the issue immediately).  Really, the circumstance involves an exchange that was awkward or cringe, and I obsess over it where my brain goes to the worst possible situation.Anyway, that's the best I can describe my mental health experience.  I'm guessing that in order to really know the status of my condition is to go off my meds, but that isnt going to happen with the new responsibility in my life.  Anyway, thanks for reading.

molly_bl00m [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar II a little over a decade ago (I’m 27 now) and have been smoking dope for the past 3-4 years (with a whole year clean thrown in there from 2016 til this May). While the substances change, I’ve always had some sort of addiction since 15 (when I tried my first drug, which was meth yay). While I obviously still struggle a bit, and two fucked life events beyond my control are what finally pushed me toward heroin, I do feel like I am in a much better place now than I ever have been - partly due to the way medication has helped me since I found my angel of a doctor, but dope has also positively affected me in two ways I didn’t expect:At first, as you’ve mentioned, it killed the pain and made me feel OKAY, for once in my life. And feeling okay gave me the strength to quit my cycle of shitty jobs and finally go back to community college. I’m now about to finish my first semester at one of the best universities in the world studying something I have loved literally for as long as I can remember. But second, and most surprisingly to me, the negative aspects of use (from having to worry about avoiding withdrawal to hating being at the mercy of dealers to feeling shitty about being the junkie in the lives of everyone I love, etc etc) have shown me that not only do I actually love myself, but I love myself and my dreams even more than I love drugs. I can’t say I’ll never go back, but when I go home this weekend for winter break I am going to kick and come back to school in January a clean machine. Without dope, I wouldn’t have had that chemical confidence to start accomplishing my goals, and without dope I wouldn’t have experienced the depths of desperation and degradation that it’s put me through which have helped me realize that I deserve my full agency back - and that I want it more than I want that next ping pong ball of black.I know this probably sounds stupid and idealistic and whatever else, but I really don’t regret my dope use cuz I’m finally learning who I am and who I want to be.

bitchcraft_101 [info] BPD and bipolar II? I'm new to reddit  so I'm sorry if I do this wrong, but I'm too nervous to talk to people in person so here I am.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2  about 2 years ago, which is the first diagnosis that's actually made sense and sounded correct (for anyone that doesnt know, bipolar II is characterized by longer depressive episodes and less intense manic episodes, called hypomania). I've been misdiagnosed countless other times, which has resulted in me being put on multiple wrong medications which worsened some of my symptoms and triggered an onslaught of a bunch of other bad shit and ended me in a really bad place in the past. Im finally on meds that work for me, but the thing is, only 2 of them are actually commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. The other 3 are actually known to cause manic episodes, which doesn't really make sense if that is actually what's going on with me.So that's really why I'm on this subreddit, to find out a little more about BPD and see if it's worth looking into as a possible diagnosis for me, at the very least so I can get the right treatment and seek someone out that specializes in people with BPD. I'm wondering too if it's possible to have bipolar disorder and BPD? I know a good few of BPD's symptoms can mimic bipolar which can lead to a misdiagnosis, but if it's possible for both to be present that would also make some sense (for me anyway). I'm a sophomore in college and I just transferred so I haven't been able to find a new therapist or psychiatrist yet to talk to about any of this, but I'm looking. I know there's a huge stigma around self-diagnosing and that's really not what I'm trying to do, but personally I think that if you think you've found something that fits what you're experiencing, it's worth bringing up to your provider regardless. I just wanted to come here first and see if anyone else experiences the same thing.TL;DR: is it possible to have both bipolar disorder and BPD at the same time, and if not what symptoms would fit where?

theraflu2018 [info] If I'm borderline, should I not date/marry and just stay single and celibate lifelong? Just to clarify, I've been seeking mental health care on a more or less regular basis since 2010. I was initially diagnosed, I believe, with PTSD and Depression back then. In 2013 I was diagnosed with bipolar II, borderline personality disorder and I was treated for bipolar disorder until 2016. The treatment providers I've seen since 2017, however, claim that I have Depression and PTSD. Psychiatry is subjective, but, it's safe to say that there is at least a remote possibility, that I actually am bipolar and borderline.With that said, given that 90% of marriages in which one partner is bipolar ends in divorce, do you guys think it's too much of a gamble to even try? I'm pretty shy and experienced in dating, and each time I've tried, it just ended up in rejection, heartache and lots of tears. Feeling in love was great, but it's more trouble than it's worth. I don't want to mess up someone else's life. Some days I have so little energy that I can't vacuum the house or cook a meal or put on makeup. I use sleep as an escape. Seems like a recipe for disaster, right?I have dated many men, been proposed to three times (I'm 25)  they usually fall in love with me and commit to me then I become a fucking mess and ruin and sabotage it.

But in the past two days I have found out that I do not have health insurance anymore, got into a fight with my husband (a really bad one) and failed a test I studied for for an entire week. A year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I'm on medication now that really helps me with day to day life. But when all those things happened all at once I freaked out completely. I kept having suicidal thoughts but they're not the kind I had when I was depresssed over a long period of time, they're more impulsive. When I came home from taking my test I was so angry and upset that I took a lot of Tylenol. My husband found out and gave me the antidote and nothing happened. But then we got in a big fight. I understand. I would be a complete mess if I were in his position. We made up after yelling and screaming and me going to a hotel last night. So everything should be good now. I know I'll figure everything out but I really cannot stop myself from freaking out and having bad thoughts. What even is this? Is it an episode? Is it a mood swing? Is it a panic attack?

I live in a Southern state and my dad's side of the family are certifiable rednecks so even though mental illness is so prominent, no one ever talked to me about it growing up.Through my teenage years, I'd constantly hear ghost stories about my grandma's house: my cousins, aunts and uncles saying that they'd seen/heard things when they'd stay there, objects moving, etc and when you grow up hearing that sort of thing all the time, you start to believe it. I'd seen/heard things too but not only in my grandparents' house; I'd hear them in mine, too.It wasn't until my mom and I moved out of a traumatic situation and in with my distant cousins around two years ago that my cousin suggested I see a therapist, if only to work through some of the things that had happened. My therapist had been asking me about my moods, the situation I'd been in, etc and a few sessions in, she asked me if I'd ever seen or heard things that no one else had. I was confused but I said yes; I'd seen figures crawling on my walls, hear knocks, scratches, but I'd chalked it up to paranormal shit for years and I told her all of this.Since then, I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and psychosis.

sweetally4 [info] I’m with you on this. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago and it’s been wreaking havoc on my life for so long. My therapist recently told me that I seem to be making small improvements and it sent me into a full fledged panic attack. I’ve been sick for so long I have no idea what life is like to be stable and functional. It’s so messed up. I want to be able to go back to work deep down inside, but right now the thought of being better is just so scary. I think because my stability can be so volatile: what if I get better just to get sick again and feel defeated all over?You’re not alone. Definitely something I would consider talking to a therapist about. [info] None [info] 1554937976
skimcortado [info] Hey man, thanks for writing. I thought about your response a few times through the day. It was a hard day and I needed all the encouragement I could get, so, thank you.I've had some form of a therapist since I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 6 years ago. I moved 2 years ago and since then haven't found anyone I like. It's near impossible to find a psychiatrist where I live so I've been making do with a general practitioner and a therapist. When I quit pot I finally got off my ass and found someone that I can actually sort of get behind. My last therapist was very pro-pot.I've been meditating and practicing mindfulness on and off for the past 5 years but it's hard to dedicate myself to it consistently. I practice yoga regularly and I went today and had this aha moment where I realized my yoga practice is firmly tied to my mental states. Usually I can settle into balancing poses pretty well but today I was just falling everywhere.Sigh. One more day down, I suppose. [info] None [info] 1435024488
Kai246810 [info] Fearful of forgetting memories I am very afraid of forgetting memories. What I mean by that is that memories fade with time, and you don't remember all the little details and emotions that come along with them after a while. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I went out last night to the plaza with some people. They informed me that 2 girls were checking me out, so I mustered up all the courage I could get, said screw it, and introduced my myself. Long story short, the 2 girls and I went to the mall today and had a great time. I want to remember this day forever, but I am paranoid that it will lose its luster and shine over time.Basically, how do you get rid of the fear of losing your memories?

loudchar [info] No urge to buy since upping my meds So I slumped a little in January, got on a holy Grail search (dark lippie), but pushed it into planner supplies hard. Stickers and markers are even dumber IMHO. I had cut back my bipolar meds because something is making me sleepy, but the doc says that's not it, so I re-upped them and I have seriously had no urge to buy! Still scrolling but it's getting easier. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for about 3 years now and I'm a therapist, still coming to terms with that. I know how the bipolar mind works, once I feel good I'm like these can go! Nope. I need my meds. Hope this helps someone.

aboyhasn0name [info] I'm diagnosed with bipolar, GAD and panic disorder. Lamictal + Xanax has been a winning combination for me lately. Just be careful with the Xanax, it can be a slippery slope. It makes me feel so "normal" and that can be addicting. So I try not to take it every day.Klonopin or Valium are slower acting benzos that stay in your system longer than Xanax. So the peaks and come down are gentler. Ativan would knock me on my ass, although I may have just had too high of a dose.May I ask why you rejected the idea of Xanax immediately?

ketothrowaway95 [info] Holy shit! When I was eating SAD, I couldn’t stay awake through an entire day, I couldn’t get my body out of bed in the morning. I was diagnosed with bipolar II as an adolescent and during my last semester I reached a point where my depressive spells would last much longer than they did before my weight gain. It was a vicious cycle of being addicted to sugar and carbs and using them to cope with feeling like shit. My first week of keto I woke up on my own before my alarm clock almost every day and I had so much energy it was hard to fall asleep. I’m more frequently manic than I am depressive now (4.5 months keto adapted with IF), and it’s so much better to have than energy and be able to channel it into school/art/exercise rather that not having the energy to do anything at all and coping with carbs/sugar. I wish I started keto last winter, I wouldn’t be retaking 2 classes if I had! I’ve heard of keto helping people with epilepsy as well. It’s so mind blowing how much better my life is now that I’m not making myself sick every day via the SAD Americans are indoctrinated with, and it pisses me off that there’s so much misinformation being spread about a WOE that’s helped me SO MUCH. After experiencing that change, I won’t eat any other way.  [info] None [info] 1534293298
commanderemily [info] My real sugar sin is we use a lot of Coffee Mate creamers. My partner drinks french vanilla like its water. Usually thats the only actual sugar product I use, that and syrups for my cappuccinos. Stevia was my replacement for sugar in my tea when I was diagnosed with bipolar. I was supposed to cut back on sugar and caffeine. So I sub a cup of coffee or two a day with a decaf tea, reduce the number of espresso based beverages I have (barely once a week, if that, and near none in the summer because its too hot and the nerd in me knows icing espresso shots completely ruins the shot), and wherever I would have added a few teaspoons of sugar add a packet or two of stevia. Like iced lemon water and tea. Coffee is the exception. Disgusting in coffee. But I'm trying.. I think the need for sugar comes from hormone fluctuations. I tend to want chocolate when my hormones fluctuate. So I'm not to worried about it leading me astray, cutting things out slowly worked when I went vegetarian (not anymore, was for 8 years) so I am most way there with the sugar problem. I just like flavor balance lol. Too much savory, need sweet. Only occasionally do I actually feel I need a sugar boost. Thats just how my body worked (blood sugar gets too low, eat something like raw oats mixed with applesauce as recommended by my trainer), but going on keto I am not doing that. So I am not 100% on my I am having cravings, but I'm hoping just drinking more stevia laden tea and kicking the sugar habit will help. [info] None [info] 1416891953

BrokenDolly_TN [info] New Bipolar Diagnosis Yesterday I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by my physician and therapist on top of the list of other mental health issues I have. So far I have told my significant other, my close co-worker, and one stranger. It's been a normal 24hrs, I don't think I've come to terms with having bipolar yet it makes so much sense and explains why I am the way I am. The reality is that I won't fix this overnight. The reality is I have to take more medication. [info] None [info] 1503700399
Emilyram [info] I think my mom is a Nmom Recently I was diagnosed with bipolar and adhd. I told her my diagnosis and her reply was that it was her fault. I did tell her it probably runs in the family. She gets defensive and sticks to it's her fault no matter how I try reassure her she isn't directly at fault. a few weeks after that, we went out to get something to eat and something brings up mental health. So I try to explain to her what bipolar is with a video because maybe I didn't explain it right before. We listen to the 19 minute video in spanish so that she really understand it. Says she now understand and to stop attacking her with it. She feels bad as it is, she says. So I drop it and move on. A few days pass and she is watching her favorite show and bipolar is the subject. Turns out she completely ignored that 19 minute video we listened to a while ago.Other things I have looked for in my past to come to this conclusion. She ALWAYS has to be right. If she isn't she comes up with something that proves she is right. Nothing I say or do is right. I say something it's wrong but when someone else says the same exact thing it's correct. After the 19 minute video I showed her. She started talking about this one client who would always tell her all her issues. She always does this to everyone else. Wanted or not she tells you her all her problems with us. She is constantly talking bad about me when she thinks I can't hear her. It has caused problems for me with the rest of my family/relatives. I came out to her as trans 3 years ago and she started crying saying it was somehow her fault. I didn't have a room till I was 18 years old because she would always say yes to my older siblings. I have so many health issues that could have easily been treated and diagnosed but wasn't because we didn't have insurance. I have to be reminded every time family gets together that I wasn't planned. My dad was drunk and she didn't say no. So I was bored because of that. She tells me I'm lazy and to get a job yet relies on me to take care of her and drive her to appointments and her job on the weekends. She get mad when I have doctors appointments or other obligations.That is all I want to type. It's a longer list than this. I plan on going no contact with all of my family once I get back on my feet. I want to confirm this so I can start the healing process and not feel guilty about what I'm about to do.

mementomori4 [info] Isn't borderline personality disorder a different set of symptoms and behaviors altogether? As a teenager I was diagnosed with bipolar II and they considered the borderline diagnosis based on my insane self-injury and a couple other things. Now, I'm 28. I haven't had a depressive dip in years and I'm not sure if it's because I'm medicated or because I don't have bipolar after all. (I definitely don't have bpd.) It's actually really odd to realize that this diagnosis that I've had for 12 years, that is part of my identity, might not be accurate. It's good, but still very, very weird.

easyiris [info] I can almost empathise, especially with the Facebook thing.I haven't seen my biological father since I was three (also an alcoholic and bipolar but I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in my late teens so I obviously don't judge). He wrote to me out of the blue when I was eighteen. We started emailing because I was too busy then to write back by post. Anyway, we've spoken on and off now for six years. I still haven't met him because I just don't feel ready to.One day, I had a friend request on Facebook from someone with no picture, no information, generic name. Accepted as I thought perhaps their profile was just very private. Seconds later, I get a message - it's my biological father, under a fake name. Promptly deleted him.I felt like it was a complete invasion of my privacy. He pretty much duped me, really. I kind of get how you might be feeling, there. Having your Mum add you to Facebook, which is probably a large part of your life - all your friends are on there, photos of you, statuses on what you've been up to and where you've been... I just think it's very invasive.Now, your Mum hasn't been in your life for a long time. She's missed out on a lot of key moments and she probably doesn't want to miss any more. She probably is very sorry and she probably did have her reasons. That's all great but it's not important right now.What's important right now is you. You are priority - she knows that. You're like a magical, super rare commodity that she needs a little piece of. YOU decide how much you give her an YOU decide when and how. Letters, emails, phone call, whatever.What's important is whether or not you feel comfortable with your estranged mother contacting you via Facebook. If I were you, I would (this is what I did with my father) make my profile incredibly private - nothing is visible to anyone, unless they are a friend all ready. I'd then give your Mother your email address and ask her to contact you via that from now on. You should make a new email address, don't give your normal email out.  I say this because my father also found my Twitter and started bringing up things I was talking about in a very creepy way. It made me feel incredibly uneasy. Also, sometimes, I would have had a shit day, would need to check my email for something and an email from him would be in my inbox. Sometimes I wouldn't want to read it straight away, you know? Sometimes, it would bring up more bad feeling and fuck up my day a bit more.Anyway. This is your life. It's up to you whether you're happy to email her, accept her on Facebook (I strongly advise you don't) or write each other letters. If you want to meet up with her, do so when you feel completely ready to. Don't let her guilt you into it. As I said, I've been talking to my father on and off for six years but I'm just not comfortable enough to meet him yet. And he nags all the time. It's pretty unbearable. Just keep the ball in your court and remember that there is no right or wrong way to go about things. Also, don't get your hopes up too much. I always imagined my biological father would be this amazing person (he went to the royal academy of music and RADA, was in the royal Shakespeare company) but he just wasn't. Unfortunately, he was an addict and he destroyed his life, throwing all of that away. I mean, the guy would have had everything. When we started speaking, he ended up being a manipulative, invasive, whiny man, via email and letters etc. It was pity story after pity story.There's a lot I could go into, emotionally, but it's not worth pounding out in one comment that will probably get buried. However, if you do read this, and you want some more personal advice, just ask. I understand how confused you probably are right now but I hope you realise that the ball is in your court. Don't allow yourself to be manipulated. Talk to her on your terms, if that's what you want to do, when you're ready, via a medium that you're most comfortable with.Sorry for the long post. I wish you lots of luck.Just wanted to add, after seeing a couple of comments - do not feel bad or sorry for your Mum because of the shit she did when she was unwell. As I said, I suffer from bipolar disorder and have done some crazy, completely horrible things. However, just because I can sometimes be unwell, doesn't mean it's an excuse for my behaviour. Sure, shit is hard but you forgive her and speak to her because YOU want to and not because she's bipolar and "didn't mean it". Doesn't matter what she did or didn't do - or what she may or may not do in the future - nor do the reasons for her behaviour matter. The damage has still been done. You do not forgive her because you feel sorry for her, you forgive her because you can genuinely make peace with her. Do it for you, not for her.I hope that makes sense. [info] None [info] 1348794179
freckledcherries [info] i'm worried about being admitted soon Okay so, a little bit of background, I'm diagnosed with bipolar 1, and was involuntarily hospitalized a couple of months ago, where I was originally diagnosed. However, I was still a minor and was put in an adolescent ward. Over the past about 2 weeks, I've gone days without food, then would binge like crazy and have lost around 10 lbs. I've been extremely paranoid and I know I'm being followed, delusional (according to friends but they don't get it), and haven't been sleeping much at all because I don't trust my surroundings enough to sleep. I've ruined two relationships with people I care about in the span of about 24 hours, and I really just don't wanna be here anymore. I've relapsed in self harm and have been really close to drinking again.I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and spent the entire time crying, but kept telling him that everything was okay, but my therapy appointment was moved earlier so now it's on tuesday and I'm freaking out a bit because my doctor already suggested hospitalization. I've never been to an adult unit and I'm just really sketchy about it and iI just dunno what to do. I live in the US by the way if that matters. [info] None [info] 1550352838
macproafro [info] Farwell Bipolar Hey guys. This subreddit has more or less been a great place for me to seek advice and vent whenever I've been depressed or feeling down.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago and honestly my life has gotten worse and worse. For some reason the medication literally never helped. I always stayed the same depressed attention seeking loser and all the methods that I had been using to treat my bipolar disorder weren't working.  Anyway last Friday I had a severe panic attack.  My stomach, shoulders, back and head were absolutely killing me.  I felt like I was dying and if I wasn't going to die I definitely knew that I was going to kill myself. I didn't think that I was having a manic or depressive phase. I just immediately went to the hospital. After spending three days languishing in a room I was sent to a psych ward. And that's where the kicker came in.  I've been misdiagnosed. (I would just like to say my entire life would be different if I had been diagnosed properly so I am absolutely furious about this.) Instead of bipolar disorder I actually have borderline personality disorder.  I'm sure many of you are familiar with this mental illness. But basically the symptoms for Bipolar Disorder and BPD are almost always confused.  The kicker is that you actually get BPD when you've suffered significant childhood trauma and due to lack of love or affection as a child.  So basically my entire brain is fucked to hell because my parents didn't love me enough and consistent physically and emotionally abused me.  I have no idea how to feel about this. I don't know what to do. I'm just sad and angry and bummed and just really annoyed about the entire situation.  The fact that this could have all been prevented if my parents weren't shitty at parenting just bums me the fuck out.  On the good side this actually explains a lot of the problems and issues I've been grappling with.  On the bad side I still have a mental illness and I have to deal with it. So anyway I don't think I'll be posting in this subreddit anymore since I'm not actually bipolar. I'll probably find some kind of BPD community on another subreddit or something. Anyway thanks for all your love and support. Peace out. [info] None [info] 1517507919
shitjoesays [info] My ex committed suicide in front of me in September 2007. I didn't see your previous post (wasn't horribly active on reddit at the time), but I'd like to share my experience with you if you don't mind. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.I was a mess after. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around the same time, so I was put on medication. It made me numb. My mom said she didn't see her daughter anymore, I was a shell of my former self. I stopped going to church and stopped answering phone calls and text messages from my friends and family. I dropped out of school and pretty much fell off the face of the planet for a few months. I felt that his suicide was my fault (didn't help that he and a few of our mutual friends felt the same way). We'd been together for 2 1/2 years and had broken up only a few months before he committed suicide. I thought I was going to marry him, we'd started planning and everything. And he took that from me in the blink of an eye. He even told me when he called me to come over thay night that he wanted to talk about getting back together. I was (obviously) foolish enough to believe him, mostly because I was still in love with him. He used my feelings for him against me, much like he had for most of our relationship. He was never wrong, and I was never right. My feelings were regularly dismissed or even made fun of for the last year of our relationship. Our "friends" regularly told me I needed to back off and give him space. In hindsight I understand, but at the time I was just confused and upset. No, I wasn't perfect in our relationship (far from it actually), but he made me feel even more crazy than I actually was, and that wasn't okay. I tell you all this so you can understand what happened in the months after his suicide.I started using again in the days after his suicide to escape the reality of what I was feeling. It was much easier to just forget I even had emotions rather than actually deal with them. I checked myself into rehab (again) before I had to have my parents or roommates do it for me.I couldn't go to his funeral. His mom asked me to come but I just couldn't trust myself in that situation. Not to mention the fact that I had actually seen him die, had held him as the life left his body. It took three rather large police officers to pull me away from him. I kept telling myself that he was going to wake up, that the bullet hadn't actually gone in and he was just unconscious from the shock. I blacked out when I saw the coroner, and the next thing I remember is waking up in my old dealer's house three days later. I don't know how they even let me go, but apparently they did. For a solid year after I believed what he told me. It was my fault he committed suicide. It didn't matter that he was sleeping with not only both of my best friends, but his boyfriend as well. In the days after his suicide they found he was HIV positive. He came from an extremely religious family, and if they had found out they would have disowned him. To this day I don't know if his parents even know. I was lucky that he had told me he was saving himself for marriage so I wasn't exposed, but both of our friends and his boyfriend tested positive a few months after. I couldn't care less about our friends, they got everything they had coming to them. But his boyfriend was innocent.  He had no idea any of us even existed. And his life was dramatically altered because of my ex's selfishness.After that year, I suddenly got really angry. I would lash out at anyone I felt had disrespected me, and I did a complete 180 on how I felt about his suicide. I went from blaming myself to hating my ex. I truly believed that he could have changed his circumstances,  and therefore he was incredibly selfish for doing what he did. It wasn't until I met my now husband in May 2009 that I really started to heal, to forgive my ex. He was sick, and for whatever reason he couldn't reach out for the help he needed. And I didn't see the warning signs, no one did. He had just gotten a promotion at work and moved into a much nicer apartment in a better neighborhood. He hid it very well, and I was too wrapped up in my own head to even realize there was a problem. If you've made it this far, thank you. If not, I'll put a TL; DR at the end. I told you all this because I want you to realize you're not alone. And if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to pm me.TL; DR my ex committed suicide right in front of me. In the days after his suicide I found out he was sleeping with three different people, two of them my former best friends. [info] None [info] 1430836482

Celany [info] Yeeeeeeeeears of therapy. Seriously. First talk therapy, then CBT combined with talk therapy. Then more talk therapy. Most recently, talk therapy and doing The DBT Skills Workbook (found on amazon), because I figured hey, why the hell not?I am both hopeful and wary about the medical issue part. On one hand, hopeful because (like I keep saying) this is just *so* out of character for her, and a big part of my stress was trying to figure out why on earth my aunt would behave that way. OTOH, wary to pin things on mental health that aren't on mental health. And really, I'll probably never know 100% if it's mental health. And also, keeping full awareness that even if it is mental health, she doens't get a free pass. One of the hardest (but most helpful) things that I was told when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder was that I should never assume or even consider that having bipolar meant that special allowances should be made for my mood problems. I was told that I could always *ask* for extra help, but that I was not owed a smidgen of forgiveness or understanding, if I hurt someone. And that it was my responsibility, first and foremost, to work on keeping myself under control. For me, hearing that was the first step in holding not just myself, but everybody around me accountable for their own shit. So if my aunt sincerely apologizes, then fine, we can move on for this weekend. Though I will expect to talk to her or my mom at some point about how her moods seem to be going poorly now, and that she needs to look into that. If she can't do that, then...that sucks, but I'm not going to get myself hurt because someone else won't take care of their problems.All that said, it is heart-breaking. I know other people with family members who kept their mental illness in check for many years, but eventually, it got bad. It's scary to think I could lose another loved one due to mental illness going out of control. Scarier still to think that someday, I could be the person lost to mental illness. On that note, I think one of my errands on the way home is going to be to pick up some comforting chocolate. Today could use a little comfort.  [info] None [info] 1512173449

wilbanks951 [info] I really do appreciated all of your words of encouragement! I have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 for almost a year. I'm typing this on the mobile app so I might not remember everything you said and reply to it, but I am seeing a therapist as well. She's not much help, all she's really done is talk about herself and then ask me how things are going. I'm basically paying her $100+ an hour to talk to her about things I could talk to my friends about. She isn't really helping me get to the root of my problems. There was my first therapist, I've had three, who I might end up switching back to. She was the best but I just couldn't afford it at the time.  As far as being bipolar though I don't blame myself. I know this is a disease, I didn't choose to go through life like this (obviously.) But I do blame myself for my actions, even though I feel like I can't control them.  I recently starting talking to someone, they told me they really liked me and that they would help me through this. I believed this person, and now I'm afraid, after a depressive episode last night, that they're gone. This was someone I really liked. And I screwed it up.  I think the thing that pushes people away is the constant whining. At least that's how they may see it. I'm sorry I get depressed, sad, tired, lonely, or don't want to go out like a normal person. But I'm not normal. I'm... this. This thing that I hate. This thing that hides behind a mask. I've built such a large cement wall around myself that nobody will ever be able to break in. Yeah there might be a few cracks, but I refuse to ever let anyone see the real me. Why? Because to them I'm insane. They don't understand. And it hurts to feel like the only one, especially with friends or in a relationship that someone even cares to understand the pain I go through on a daily basis. The sickness in my head.  I guess I'll wrap this up here, I wanted to mention one more thing about what you said about your job. I've been at mine, nothing big just retail, but I'm in the process of a promotion. I'm working full time (30+ hours) as well as going to school full time (12 credit hours).  I'm proud of myself for that, but at the same time I wish I could do more.  I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with myself or my happiness.  Again thank you for sharing everything you have with me so far. It's meant a lot and I'm really glad you understand.

Itneedsmore_zazz [info] Stereotypes As a nurse I coordinate a lot of patient care. Today I received a phone call from a patient who requested a letter specifically stating but he doesn't have a serious mental illness like being bipolar or schizophrenic. My heart sank when I heard that. I have a full-time job, a house, a car, an associate's degree, and an awesome fulfilling social life. One of my best friends is also schizophrenic, she is also responsible with her diagnosis. She has a high-profile job, two Bachelor degrees and a master's degree. It is for this reason, why I'm always so hesitant to tell people that I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1. We are so often misconstrued in the media as well as having these negative stereotypes propagated Within our own local communities. I am proud that we've come so far, but it still hurts when I hear things like this. I have to remember that this isn't something that people can see, that most people understand, that most people don't experience in their lifetime until they come in contact with somebody at the very worst. I apologize for this being very long post, but I hope that at least a few of you can take solace in my experience and know that we are strong tribe. Everyday that we wake up and decide to face the world proves that we are strong. It's like having 50 lb weight always tight around your neck but we still keep going. [info] None [info] 1556165014
Interestedatheist [info] My PMS used to last two weeks, the week before my period and the week of my period. I was diagnosed with bipolar because it was so bad and I used to cycle between highs and lows so much, but I didn't make the connection to my period until I switched to a contraception that meant I didn't have periods. My moods have been completely stable ever since. Both high and low levels of sex hormones can cause emotional instability, just because hormone levels spike before your period, that doesn't mean that your lower hormone levels during your period wont affect your mood too.

myshkin85 [info] I don't think I'll ever be sober for a long period of time. In the past 6 months I've been trying to quit drugs/alcohol I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, put on medication that makes me feel crazier than normal and doesn't stop my moods from cycling, and every time I'm manic I end up relapsing and doing worse and worse things every time. I used to think I had potential. I don't anymore. I'm convinced that I'm going to eventually die either by accidentally overdosing or killing myself. [info] None [info] 1356046258
beccaabrooke [info] Bipolar and birth control I am a 25 year old female and I doubt my weight is very important to this lol but I’m tiny. Anyways when I was younger I was diagnosed with bipolar and after trying different medications I got landed on lithium. So I’ll be honest I forget to take it sometimes and that’s my bad. The problem is I started on birth control pills for the first time and my doctor briefly asked about the lithium but didn’t say anything really about it. They put me on birth control and since then I have been bad. It’s been years since I felt out of control sadness or anger with debilitating panic attacks. I hate it and I’m miserable. My question is does birth control affect bipolar in anyway? It’s hard to tell if it’s from the pill or just a badness episode coming at a suspicious time. I don’t want to get off birth control because it stops my cramps completely but if it’s cramps or everyday of emotional hell I’ll take cramps lol. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

Kaniela420 [info] I've never been officially diagnosed with 1 or 2, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3 times by different Dr's and therapists. I can tell you though that I most definitely am more inclined to believe I am bipolar 1, as I experience auditory hallucinations at times, and some pretty ghastly psychosis experiences. But, I've never been hospitalized for it, and apparently a lot of folks read that in a description and believe that to be a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of bipolar 1.I think I'm just better at suppressing my actual thoughts and feelings when I know I have an audience that has the authority to lock me up against my wishes. Probably my misspent youth doing illegal shit and evading cops.  My depressive phases, quite the contrary to what most people describe with 1 and 2, are actually relatively short. I'd say on average maybe 1 to 2 weeks, although I have had a depressive episode last upwards of a year once or twice. My Mania, on the other hand, is frequent and has a mighty large reserve tank when the gas runs low. My longest manic episode I would say lasted more than a year. As I don't have much of a frame of reference for the depressive side, (besides loss of interest in hobbies/things I've enjoyed, staying in bed and staying in my sweats and not bathing for a week at a time, isolating myself from everyone I know and becoming quiet and distant), I'll give you a rundown of what mania/hypomania looks like, for me.It starts out; everything is fucking AWESOME! I have so much energy and I feel so good, I really need to get this house clean! Oh wow I finished the house in no time! You know what, I should really clean out my closet and get rid of a bunch of shit I don't wear.... You know what? I'm having such a great day, and it's so beautiful out, I should have a Corona! Wow this beer tastes good, I think I'll have 1 or 2 more. Hmm.... I have a pretty nice buzz going, but I really feel like having a shot. I'm gonna go for a drive to the next town over that has the only liquor store in the valley open on Sundays and bump some gangsta rap. Man it sucks being in such a celebratory mood and not having anyone to hang out with, I'm gonna start blowing up Facebook with funny commentary and trying to hit up all my long lost friends on chat! Oh my God I have such a great idea on how to effectively make our partnership with our global convergys reps more cohesive! And while I'm at it, I'm going to put a training together on how to use our engineering coverage maps, I guess that means I'll have to learn how to ACTUALLY be what I always claim to be on my resumes, "proficient" in PowerPoint! Fuck it, I'll figure it out, I'll just wing it! Oh shit only 2 hours before my husband gets home and he doesn't like it when I drink, I wonder if I have time to pop in to the bar around the corner and have a couple crown and cokes and make it back here before he gets home... I just want to socialize a little bit! Next morning, after blacking out and getting maaaaybe 3 hours of sleep. "Oh damn. I think I might still be a little drunk. How did I even make it to bed last night? Why is my husband sleeping on the couch? No time to deal with that dfamay, gotta get ready to go get dis bread!" *Spends a COPIOUS amount of time fixing hair and makeup and getting those wings JUST RIGHT. Takes forever picking out a necklace and boots to accessorize perfectly* "well shit. I'm 10 minutes late as usual. Where are my damn keys!?" *Gets to work, spends entire morning meeting interrupting everyone and trying to make sure I command the most attention and have a funny comment or anecdote for every single topic that is mentioned.* *Starts on PowerPoint for that great idea I had last night. "Oh you need me to help you work your follow-ups? Sure! Bring em on! Gosh our servicing partners have a lot of questions, but I absolutely can NOT leave any of them unanswered. But the more I answer them the more they private message me and only come to me with their questions... Oh well, this should help get me some recognition so I have some visibility for that promotion I always say I don't want..." Before long I am over extended and HIGHLY annoyed and snappy and bitchy with ANYONE that tries to transfer me a call, as if it's their fault I'm busy...Aaaah home after a long day, time to pick a fight with my husband and be annoyed by my son's existence. I need some alone time. I'm gonna go see if there's any leftover fun drugs I can crush and snort. God my life is so MUNDANE and eventless. You know what would make me feel better? Some retail therapy. I'm gonna buy a bunch of clothes online and then because I can't wait I'm gonna go to a local store and buy a cute new outfit! None of my clothes fit me anymore because I've already dropped a fuckton of weight because I'm manic, plus I just cleaned out my closet today, I've earned it! This goes on, and on, and ON, for days or weeks, my fuse gets shorter and shorter and I fucking RAGE and go mad hoss at the slightest inconvenience. Then, thanks to good ol lack of sleep and photo editing projects, I start hearing shit. "What is that sound? Why does it sound like 2 morning radio DJ's talking? I don't have the radio on... Why is it so muffled like I can't ever make out what they're actually saying??" Then, the visual fuckery comes into play. -ESPECIALLY- if I am home alone, which I fucking HATE being home alone as I am convinced that the bad man has been laying in wait, waiting for the opportunity for me to be alone so he can rape/murder me. Throw that in with the eye fuckery and the muffled voices of 2 dudes in another room... We've got ourselves a party! I once carried a 9mm throughout the house all night and all morning long, convinced that there were people in the house that were going to get me. I saw someone's glasses reflecting in the moonlight watching me from the park across the street... I even called the cops and made them patrol my house. Twice. My house is fucking tiny. With paper thin walls. I can't believe they didn't haul my ass off. The best one was my most recent psychosis though, where I became convinced that my hairline was receding and that it was caused by scalp ringworm I must have gotten from my son or our dog. I walked around the house, spraying the walls with bleach water, I thought the cobwebs were mold or some sort of fungus that wanted to collect my hair. The spiders in the shower were watching me in eager wait to collect my hair, I saw them eating it, or making a web with it, I wasn't sure which. The flies were working with them, it was a covert op where they would dive bomb me, snatch my hair and give it to the spiders, who would then in turn give it to the mold monsters. I wore a beanie inside at all times, to try to protect my hair. It went on for several days, and didn't stop until my husband came and collected me out of the front yard, where I was sitting, picking ringworm pebbles out of a beanie I had just pulled out of the dryer, refusing to go inside because I didn't want to lose any more of my hair... He had to walk me around and make me point out the things I was seeing, so that he could explain them away for me. THAT. was a real muthafucka of a psychosis. Worst one yet, though thus far I've only had about 4 major events since I was diagnosed. As I get older, my symptoms get worse, even with medication. My rage gets more severe, my fuse shorter, the flight of rapid fire ideas, becoming early overwhelmed, crippling fear of calling places for bills, Dr's appts, basically any grown up obligation. And the presence of those auditory hallucinations definitely grows more prevalent. And so, yeah.... That about sums it up... Sound anything like your thing? Lol [info] None [info] 1573310303
h4baine [info] You're not alone. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 18 and have been through some scary periods where meds didn't seem to be the right fit and it felt like it would never get better. It always does though. Sometimes it takes time to find the right meds for you but it does get better. You know when you need help and you're getting it. That's a huge step many people don't take.You said you were going to urgent care and I hope you have a good experience but know that not all family doctors have the best grip on psychiatry. If one of them says something stupid, it's not because of you. I've heard some ignorant ass comments from general practitioners, don't let their ignorance derail you if that happens.It gets better but it's okay to have days when things aren't okay. It's normal and it's important to know when you're in that so you can reach out for help. [info] None [info] 1509395761
sssimulacrum [info] Hi everyone. I'm new here and I just wanted to say... I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple years ago after a severely manic episode. I had been doing horribly in college (not going, not studying, etc) and I was really depressed and down about life in general. I am here to tell you guys that succeeding is possible! I have three semesters left on a Chemistry degree and so far for this semester I have gotten 100's on ALL of my tests at a fairly prestigious and well-known college. As long as you put your mind to something and are willing to work for your goals, you can do it! Don't let this stop you. It will only make things that much better when you actually achieve your dreams! [info] None [info] 1425149958

LaurenxKate68 [info] Thank you for asking for advice on this matter. I am diagnosed with bipolar as well. (23F)Bipolar disorder is a tough disorder that affects their entire life. Yes, lack of sleep, sugar, alcohol and even caffeine can worsen symptoms and increase manic episodes. One of the easiest ways to help with mood frequencies is to cut out alcohol in general. Bipolar persons can feel alcohol related symptoms of mania for even up to two weeks and can actually cause someone on lorazepam to go to sleep and never wake up if they take multiple alcoholic drinks while on the medication. I think the most important part of dating someone with bipolar disorder is patience and communication. I can tell that you are proactive in making your relationship work with her disorder and that you are passionate about making this work. When you get into a manic state, extreme irritability is a common symptom and it’s due to lack of sleep..when you’re manic, you feel like you’re floating almost and it’s hard for you to make educated rational decisions because you feel emotions full throttle and it’s extremely hard to control them as you assess risk differently. Most bipolar persons in manic episodes do not realize the effect they are truly having on others while in that state because I like to refer to it as their perception of reality is skewed in that time frame, so it would make sense that she could potentially be borderline abusive to you in that state but not fully comprehend the true effect of what she is saying and how it affects you. It may seem like you are dealing with two separate people (manic vs non manic) and that because you honestly are. You are very understanding of her and her disability and that is so important. The main key is communication and patience. Listening to what she needs, helping keep her perspective of reality on when she’s in those states. If you are aggressive or argumentative back she may match it with even more aggression, best thing to try is to agree with her concerns in that state, be calm and give her her space if she needs it. I hate to say this, but you will probably need to be the bigger person in arguments.  It is unfortunately a chemical imbalance that many people suffer from but with the property medicine and treatment they are able to live relatively normal lives. Everyone I have told that I am bipolar have told me they would’ve never known if I didn’t tell them and that’s because I’ve been able to master my emotions and even maintain healthy long term relationships as well as full time jobs.  If you have any questions about bipolar disorder I would love to answer them. I hope this helps you understand what may cause symptoms of bipolar and how to counteract it.

NewBipolar [info] I have started having visual and auditory hallucinations for the first time and I don't know how to proceed. I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder not too long ago, but I had no history of hallucinations, or too distorted thinking. In the last few days I have been hearing voices and seeing a large number of visual hallucinations, revolving around paranoia. The voices are whispers behind me, and the visual hallucinations are either someone or something watching me or attacking me, disappearing right before impact. I am afraid my doctor or therapist will send me away if I tell them, am I just being paranoid or should I be worried? [info] None [info] 1459226694

guavayum678 [info] 1 year antipsychotic free, quitting benzo now About a year ago I successfully got off 2 years of antipsychotics (+ mood stabilizers) after a long taper. I haven’t had a relapse. I was diagnosed with bipolar which completely went away after I treated underlying Lyme disease (which was also causing neurological and constitutional symptoms). About two years ago I was given 1mg Ativan to help me sleep. I think the insomnia was secondary to other health issues which I’ve since treated. I kept taking it and then found it difficult to stop. I’ve successfully cut down to .5. I know this sounds like a small dose, but I tend to be very sensitive to meds so I think it’s effect is greater than the dosage indicates. When I was on antipsychotics and benzos I completely lost my libido with blunted orgasms. (Woman here.) in the past, if a drug can affect libido it’ll blunt mine, even at a low dose. I am quitting the benzo now because I desperately want my libido to return. I  hoping my libido will return after completely stopping Ativan. I am scared the antipsychotics might have adversely affected my dopamine receptors and it might not come back. I need some hope right now. My life is very satisfying otherwise and I strongly believe the libido changes are not due to an underlying mental health issue. Has anyone has libido issues on a benzo? Did it improve upon quitting?

celolex [info] I don't like saying this on my main account (because, as you've admitted, there's a lot of stigma) but I was diagnosed with bipolar two weeks ago. The stigma is one of the most difficult things to grapple with. I'm afraid to tell friends because I'm worried they'll cut me out of their lives if they know.  It's important to remember that bipolar manifests in many different ways, and your experience with one person is not indicative of everyone with the condition. Additionally, while she obviously caused you significant emotional distress, this girl in no way "totally ruined" your life – certainly not to the degree that she's ruining her own.

iamthe_girl [info] Good for you, for kicking the drugs! Street drugs (sans marijuana), when paired with bipolar just makes your symptoms worse. Self-medicating is EXTREMELY normal, however. All you want is to escape the madness inside your brain, I get that. The flip side to that, is to develop a routine like you have! I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago, and was recently diagnosed with schizoaffected disorder: bipolar type. For years, I self-medicated with meth, coke, acid, etc. Once I got on the right meds as a young adult, my drug habits changed. And now that I am older, I try to have routines too. If I don't stick to my routines, I feel "off" and depressed. I find myself feeling like a loser, and incapable of daily activities. In short, I absolutely think you are on the right track in having a routine. The routine keeps your mind healthy and functioning. Keep up the great work!  [info] None [info] 1510496472

EventideOwl [info] Coming to terms with being emotionally abused... Still processing everything So, I learned a bit recently, thanks to my amazing and supportive boyfriend, that I seem to have quite the number of qualities of a person who has been emotionally abused (possibly as a child?)This is an article he pointed me to that helped open my eyes:  http://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2017/07/25-common-behaviors-of-someone-who-has-experienced-childhood-emotional-abuse.htmlFrom the list of that article alone, #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7 (this especially has been eye opening), #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 (sort of), #16 (had big issues with this especially in the past), #17 (battled this always, but it is slowly getting better), #18 (although my only addictions have been kinda to food in a way, and also to the internet/gaming in the past), #19, #21 (I have taken a pair of scissors to mutilate my thumb nails when I was much younger and have done that twice in my life, and I also developed Trichotillomania (an impulsive hair pulling disorder), #22? (I am not so sure about this one, but I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the past), #23 (I have been told by a therapist when I was a child that I tend to disassociate and I still go through it today, daily, at some point or the other), and I guess #25 too since I kinda was used to living with very little or being more of a minimalist for so many years.   So, basically just about everything on the list aside from one or two things, I go through in my life and it has especially become strongly held in my personality in my adult life (I am 35 now.) I am thinking the emotional abuse has come from my dad, but it is really hard to think on when he did so when I was a child.  I do know that the last time I was attempting to stay at my parents' house that he was being very emotionally abusive from what I am trying to recognize now.  Some examples of things that happened just last year around my dad:  When I was sitting at the dinner table especially was when the sessions of abuse would happen.  I remember just last year how he would pick on the way I was using my fork and knife to eat my food (even though I like to think I have decent manners?) or if I was eating way too fast.   Another time my mom was asking me if I wanted an old trunk that I used to have when I was 12 years old (a year I went to a military school) and I told her, politely, no thank you and said that it gives me bad memories of the time in military school.  My dad then said something along the lines of 'Well that also gave us bad memories too of having to pay for you to go to this school."  Another time, he was talking about one of my second cousins (who has very severe down syndrome) and saying how my second cousin deserves to be on disability income so much more than I do (I have been on disability income since the early 2000's, for mental health and emotional reasons obviously, but my dad seems to think I don't need it.)   Then there was a time where he literally was trying to help me either clean or fix something with my car and he turned to me and said something along the lines of "I do not ever feel sorry for you." (he was talking about how I am on disability income, his biggest gripe with me and what has ultimately made me forced to be estranged from him and the rest of my family.)I'm still processing everything.  Especially trying to figure out what exactly my dad did while I was growing up to do this.  Although he did and does still have a monstrous yelling voice and I literally have grown to be afraid of any male that yells now.  It automatically makes me curl up into a ball and just want to hide.   And I know this might not be a big deal to some, especially since it was more accepted in the 80's and prior, but he has used a belt to spank me when I was a kid before.  He was also very strict, but the whole situation is hard because I feel like I also might of done this to myself..?   I was sexually molested when I was either 9 or 10 years old (my memory is kinda foggy on which age I was) by a 15 year old boy that was babysitting me, twice, and since that happened, I began to isolate myself and shut my dad fully out of my life seemingly (even though he never sexually abused me.)  This was also the event that changed me as a person and I developed so many mental health and emotional issues afterward.I could go on... But I was wondering if I could have some feedback?  I don't know. [info] None [info] 1514156393
littlehoneypossum [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar at the beginning of the year and I definitely recommend seeing a doctor about it! Even if you don't get on medication or anything like that, it's nice to know what is actually going on up there and with a diagnosis you can be given access to a registered nurse who can help you with therapy and medication (if you choose to take it). After a few months of mania and no sleep I remember taking seroquel for the first time and being like "ohhh... being tired feels... nice". I'm not on it anymore but I still think the diagnosis and the nurse are both helpful in my everyday life. PM if you wanna discuss more! [info] None [info] 1572566883

raeburnandwesley [info] 1. I’m in experimental psychology and am currently working at a university. Right now my main research focus is on the development of temperament in infants and small children, researching trends in behavior and brain structure/function that could serve as potential indicators for psychopathology in adulthood.2. Ah that is a good question. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 when I was 18, right as I was beginning undergrad. I had no idea what I wanted to study in school and my symptoms were growing out of control. That year was very difficult but I somehow managed to complete it, albeit with subpar marks. Soon after the beginning of my second year of undergrad I experienced the most severe depressive episode of my life. I was hospitalized and forced to withdraw from school. I started taking lithium at this time and took a year off school. During that year I spent a lot time learning about my illness and realized quickly how fascinated and interested I was in it and in psychopathology as a whole. There was power in understanding and I decided that I wanted to study psychology. In addition to this, I responded extremely well to my medication and soon my symptoms were much more manageable and I was able to return to school. I owe it to my medication and excellent treatment that I was even able to make it to grad school. Grad school itself was extremely strenuous, even with my symptoms at a manageable level. If my condition had been anywhere near as severe as it was at age 19/20 I definitely would not have been able to do it. My incredible mentors and colleagues and the fact that I was truly doing what I was passionate about and what I wanted more than anything was what got me through. I really enjoyed working in a lab. Lab work and learning were incredibly empowering for me and served as escapes. I am so proud of myself for what I’ve been able to accomplish as far as my schooling and thankful for what it allows me to do today. tl;dr With excellent treatment my symptoms were much more under control by the time I was in grad school. I had a huge love of what I was doing and a great support system. It was very difficult, and there were some bumps along the road, but that is how I survived. :) [info] None [info] 1569911926
Throwaway420414 [info] Diagnosed Bipolar and on Lithium. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few months ago and have been on lithium since then. Honestly the lithium is great, I am stable for the first time in my life and can't say I feel all that much emotional blunting. One thing that's been eating me up is what I'm going to do once the shit hits the fan. Going off of my meds is not an option as my lows consist of seeing and hearing things during panic attacks. Being on lithium requires constant monitoring of blood levels and kidney function etc. which is obviously not feasible in the face of collapse. I'm considering an exit strategy for when I see the writing on the wall. Anyway, don't know why I posted this. Just needed to get this out there I guess. If I brought this up to my therapist or Dr. they'd probably hospitalize me, so I feel pretty isolated. [info] None [info] 1557198430

Today I was so full of energy it felt like my chest would explode.  My pain from my connective tissue disorder, which had been at like a 5, abruptly went to 0 despite me doing nothing to treat it.  Also I had a 3 hour long internet binge I literally could not tear myself away from, and I spent a bunch of money on shit I don't need. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was in college, but I thought it was a mistake.  I didn't feel like I have the mood swings she described. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if maybe I should try to treat my bipolar and if that would help the ADHD.  My executive function skills have been absolute GARBAGE the last few days. Would love it if bipolar meds helped that. TL;DR - I think I'm having a hypomanic episode and I don't know why, and it's scary and weird. But also I feel physically amazing so that's nice. Trying to figure out how it intersects with ADHD. [info] None [info] 1575794885
moosiemae [info] For a while I used to think that I was only as sick as I wanted to be - when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, the one thing my therapist kept coming back to was the fact that I seemed to blame it on myself. Whenever I felt a particular extreme on one end of the spectrum or the other, a little part of me would look back on that incident and kinda scold myself for "acting crazy". I genuinely believed that all of it was in some way rooted in how I wanted to behave.Thankfully, I have learned these past few years to get over the prejudice I had against my own illness. When I start acting manic, or when things are really bad on the depressive end of the spectrum and I can barely function, I know that's not me. It's my illness.  [info] None [info] 1501217191

obscureengineer [info] Before I was diagnosed with bipolar, I would obsess over projects and ignore my responsibilities while manic. When I was 16, I was working on a large anamatronic that was meant to be designed, built and coded by many people, by myself. I let other aspects of my life fail because I thought it was the only thing that mattered. My downfall was my lack of coding experience and stubbornness, and the anamatronic never came through before competition.

Anxietyfuckedmeup [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began Ability which did nothing for me. Then I went on to take seroquel which improved my stability with the trade off of making me quite tired and lethargic because I needed quite a high dose. I have since been put on trileptal as well as a low dose of seroquel. Long story short, seroquel high dose made me a zombie but made me not go back to the hospital. Lower dose is great for me.

axon-axoff [info] I agree that OP may want to see a therapist/psychiatrist. I have always done the same thing, alternating between avoidance and hyper-productivity. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my late teens but mood-stabilizing meds didn’t improve my quality of life on their own. More recently I was diagnosed with ADHD and a combo of low-dose mood stabilizers and ADHD medication (in addition to DBT once a week with a therapist I like) work for me. “Hyperfocus” is actually a characteristic of some varieties of ADHD. There’s so much overlap in definitions of mental conditions, the only thing that really matters is finding medication and therapy (I really believe in both) that work for you, not the label.

kelseyroundtherosie [info] First post on r/loseit 28 pounds down! I’m actually a little anxious to post, but I’ve been lurking since I started my weight loss journey and promised myself I’d post at 25 lbs down but talked myself out of it, but I know I needed to post or I never would’ve worked up the nerve so here it goes.Female/23/5’7.5Start date: November 1stStart weight: 248Current Weight: 220Goal weight: 165&gt;A little about me and my weight; growing up I was in the upper normal weight range, muscular but with hips and bust. I did sports but always had an extra little bit of fat you know? Normal.  I reached full height early along with the majority of the rest of my body devolvement. Then at 13 I was diagnosed with bipolar and shit kinda hit the fan. Meds were a huge weight disturbance. My smallest I was age 13-14, I was still swimming competitively at the time and I was 145 pretty much all muscle do to initial nausea with med intake and adderall-like medication I was put on at the time. My largest I was 16-17 inactive and mostly house bound at 280+. Every new med change brought a weight change. Gains or losses of 20 pounds were not uncommon. Some as dramatic as 30-40 in less than 4 months. I have been on more than 30 different med combinations. I own 3 sets of clothes: pants range from 14-16, 18-20 and 20-24. I had no control over my weight and for a long time no desire or motivation to workout. It wasn’t until the last year or so I got my illness under enough control to begin considering doing something about it, but the med changes still caused wild swings, mostly because I was going through withdrawals.This October I was down to my last lithium reduction and I told myself I needed to get healthy if I wanted to continue without meds. I was going out dancing and took a picture, weighed myself and said once I’d finish I’d start.November 1st was the first day I didn’t take any pills and the first day I set goals and started my journey. I have lost majority of my muscle mass, I want to climb stairs, dance, and run without getting winded. I want a healthy BMI, I’ve got living stuff to do now man and everything is easier with a normal weight. I want to be able to manage my moods, food and exercise are my pills now.I have minimum workouts 4x a week I do for an hour. Along with walks and dancing with headphones I’m slowly but surely rebuilding muscle mass.As for diet I don’t really count calories, it was mostly just educating myself. How many fruits and vegetables I was really supposed to eat a day and how much protein I actually needed. I keep grains to a minimum and only eat sugars when I really want a treat. Alcohol is now something I consider a desert. 3 servings of my veggies are almost always raw a day.All of this is going well but I’m honestly in uncharted territory. I’ve never really tried losing weight before and not sure what to expect as more weight comes off.  Will I have trouble dropping weight as I lose more this way?Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading. [info]   [info] 1513994404
blackbird_girl [info] Oh god, thank you. I'm so glad I found your post on r/happy. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well and was dealing with mental health issues since I was 13. I was the perpetual honor student, achiever of the family, until I wasn't able to go to school or focus on my studies anymore because of my mind and other students' bullying. One of my teachers was especially harsh, saying to the whole class that if we're to go on with what we're doing (absences, low grades), then we better not go to college as we'll only be a burden to our parents. Everyone knows that she was talking about me. She repeatedly humiliated me in class in subtle ways. It was crushing, being golden girl to garbage.Fast forward and I've dropped out of college twice, never finishing a semester. Most of my classmates already graduated from college, which is the ultimate goal where I'm from. I almost started believing that my teacher's right. Now, I'm about to start my second year in college (FINALLY, YAY!) studying something I love and slightly back to achiever status, but with a lot of struggles. Mental health treatment is expensive so I've been on and off of it, and I usually feel like I'll never get out of the cycle. So high up then crashing to the pits of hell. But seeing other people with bipolar disorder overcome and live life fully (Carrie Fisher, for example, RIP) really made me hope that I can, too. I root for them so much. And when those who know about me ask about famous people with bipolar, I usually say Demi Lovato, as people my age know her.Demi said that "it IS possible." It's been a tough few days with school stress and other life issues that the news about her really shook me. I found myself asking Demi (in my mind) to please tell me that it IS still possible. Even when bipolar turns me into someone I wouldn't want to be.You, mister, just told me that it IS possible. You don't know how much I needed this. I thank you so much for that.Love and light to you, bipolar brother!  [info] None [info] 1532707531
tearcatcher3 [info] Executive dysfunction(?) Hi! I haven't posted here (or really anywhere) before, but I am a college student doing remote learning due to the COVID19 situation, and the way these circumstances are exacerbating my symptoms finally drove me to stop being shy. I am hoping you guys can help me. I was wondering if it's considered executive dysfunction/a common symptom of ADHD in general to have a problem where you cannot do certain tasks unless you complete other ones first, and you have to do them in a certain order or else there's a huge mental block. Compounding this is also the fact that I seem to feel like I have to do these things in a certain way ( don't ask me what that way is. I'm not sure if it even exists, because I definitely don't have a concrete idea) or I'm not doing them "right." It stops me from initiating anything I have to do. I then get ridiculously frustrated with myself for not completing any tasks at all. A lot of it is, like, I have this ideal day/schedule in my head, and then if I screw it up once (almost inevitable, because I'm human and also because I have trouble doing things to begin with), I can't do the rest of it, it's ruined. Does anyone else experience this? If so, have you found effective ways to cope?I googled this and got pages for OCD, but I don't really exhibit any other OCD symptoms and I've been seeing a psychiatrist for over a decade now and he never seemed to think I did, either. For background, I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. Some people in my life suspect I may be autistic (not inclined to disagree), but I've never had it checked out. Thanks, guys. I hope you're all doing well! [info] None [info] 1586818524

AmyB848484 [info] I've been in your situation. I also take meds for bipolar that I can't stop because I'd be a danger to myself if I do. I had a similar situation where the guy disappeared and I wasn't working, and I didn't want to become a burden to my family. I was afraid I'd regret it for the rest of my life. I was raised to believe it was murder. When I had the procedure done, all I felt was a sense of relief. A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and if I had a child, there's no way I'd be mentally or financially stable enough to take care of it. The guy who was the father, I thought he'd disappeared because he wanted nothing to do with the baby, but he had gotten arrested and locked up in another state and had tried to contact me. He was upset about the abortion, but he just ended up going to prison and lost all the money he had fighting the case. So if I'd had that baby, I would have been on my own financially and dealing with the prison system 1000 miles away. I have no regrets. I dodged a major bullet. I'm unable to work due to my condition, and I would have been trying to raise a child when my symptoms started, and probably would have ended up losing custody due to my mental illness. It would have been cruel to bring a child into such a situation. I would definitely do it again (if I had it to do over again, I never would have been with that loser in the first place, but if I couldn't take that back, I'd definitely have the procedure again)   I wish you the best in whatever you do. Don't feel any guilt about doing what you have to do. As a fellow bipolar sufferer, raising a baby is a stress that you just shouldn't bring on yourself unless you 100% want to do it with all your heart. I also don't want children because mental illness runs in my family and I don't want to bring anyone into the world who might have my bipolar genes, because I don't wish this on anyone.

Lancium [info] Yeah you need to see someone about this. I had the same problem. Every car that drove by was something to jump in front of, every building something to jump off of, and driving was rife with possibilities. I didn't want to die, but I felt like I was being pushed to. I couldn't stop thinking about it, intrusive thoughts definitely. I told my counselor and they had me involuntary committed.

EleanorRigby96 [info] Wondering if I should tell my dad Hi, everyone. So, I was diagnosed with bipolar I about 2 months ago. I'm seeing a therapist, and working on getting in to see a psychiatrist to start meds.What I'm wondering is if I should tell my dad. We have a mostly ok, but difficult relationship. My brother has borderline personality disorder, and while my dad always told me that my mother was bipolar, several years ago I overheard him telling a few of his friends that she was actually schizophrenic (he'd definitely lie to me about her diagnosis, but would tell his friends the truth). My mother was horrible to him when they were married (she pulled knives on him, purposely crashed her car into our car port, cheated on him a lot, etc.). Because of her illness/behavior, he had to deal with having her committed and her being in and out of rehab (she was an alcoholic and drug addict as well) a few times. With my brother having his condition, he's  been a lot to handle over the years as well. I guess I'm worried that my dad won't react well to hearing that yet another person in the family has a mental illness, especially since my brother attempted suicide less than a year ago. Should I tell my dad? If so, should it wait for a while until things with my brother settle down a bit? How does one decide whether or not they should tell certain people about this stuff?

Ramen8ion [info] Tired of seeking help and meeting dead ends I’m really angry basically. I feel so lost and stuck in the system, just to make it clear, I live in the UK. I was diagnosed with bipolar for almost 10 years now (first mood disorder NOS cuz I was a minor, then bipolar at 18). I’ve been hospitalised many times as are most people with bipolar and my last admission was jan 2016 after almost 6 months of being hypomanic and unaware, it turned into a horrible mixed episode where I was wandering the streets confused and unaware. That’s when I had insurance through my uni scholarship and went into a private psychiatrist hospital. I don’t have insurance anymore, I started reducing my meds because they affected my health so badly and my mood started going all over the place, spent the past months at home never leaving and feeling extremely suicidal, I have planned detailed plans so many times. I have barely any support from anyone and feel lonely in this struggle.I finally got the courage to speak to the NHS GP so I could access help and see what I could do about this. I had an appointment with a mental health nurse after waiting months and explained what’s been going on. The nurse kept trying to downplay everything ‘so just a little depressed? You haven’t actually killed your self?’In the end i just get a letter in the post saying he spoke to a psychiatrist and this was his recommendation:1) stay off meds and ‘apply therapeutic methods you learnt in the past’2) if u feel worse take a low dose of anti depressants.What the actual fuck. ANTI DEPRESSANTS triggered my first manic episode. You are not meant to take them alone. I’m completely unmedicated and have been of high risk for so long. Without any access to healthcare as a person with a serious diagnosis, and this is  the only medical advice I’m receiving.It makes me feel what’s the point. Like I keep hitting brick walls. As if it’s not bad enough to deal with this condition sometimes. It’s like they want you dead to get rid of you sometimes. The anger in me is not even normal right now, I’m just so so angry and I have every right to be. What do I even do. [info] None [info] 1559700511
mickcube [info] i know it's not news that kanye doesn't know how to talk but pitchfork printed this transcript and it's incredible how similar it is to how trump speaks&gt; At one point, West discussed why he wears a MAGA hat:&gt; &gt; This hat, it gives me power in a way. My dad and my mom separated, so I didn’t have a lot of male energy in my home. And, also, I’m married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It’s beautiful, though! I love Hillary. I love everyone. But the campaign “I’m With Her” just didn’t make me feel—as a guy that didn’t get to see my dad all the time, a guy that could play catch with his son—it was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman.&gt; &gt; Later, he discussed the 13th Amendment, which segued into West talking about bipolar disorder:&gt; &gt; I did say “abolish” with the hat because, why would you keep something around that’s a trapdoor? If you’re building a floor, the Constitution is the base of our industry—of our country, of our company—would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally something happens and you fall and end up next to the Unabomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship.&gt; &gt; The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment—and I think the way the universe works, it’s perfect. We don’t have 13th floors, do we? The four gentlemen that wrote the 13th Amendment didn’t look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read. Or African-Americans to read. And so that meant that if you actually read the amendment, you’d get locked up and turned to a slave! Again. So, what I think is we don’t need sentences, we need pardons.&gt; &gt; I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. He looked at my brain. It’s equal on three parts. I’m gonna go ahead and drop some bombs for you: 98th percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting numbers backwards, so I’m gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent. Tesla. Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar. I had sleep deprivation, which can cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got—and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that—I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage. [info]  [info] 1539283597

D4DDYL0NGLEGGS [info] Why isn’t weed legal? I was diagnosed with bipolar II in 2010 while on a stent in rehab for trying to kill myself by taking a 90 day prescription of Ativan. Thank god for my mother that’s all I will say about that. While in rehab they had me taking Depakote, Seroquel, Wellbutrin, Trazadone, and a host of other things. I hated it. I felt like a zombie. So when they released me I took my treatment into my own hands and started smoking pot. Flash forward 9 years and I have been a medicinal smoker, everyday,  as needed. It has helped me out tremendously! I have kept a stable job, have a car that is now paid off,  kept a roof over my head, and am engaged to be married. All of which would have been impossible if I wasn’t self medicating and staying away from the hard shit (pre-rehab I would do whatever you set in front of me). I recently applied for a job as an outdoor instructor at a summer camp working with under privileged kids. A drug test is mandatory and as such I have quit smoking. I feel like I want to blow my brains out. I’m not sleeping or eating, my fiancé is ready to murder me because of my mood swings, seriously I’m absolutely miserable. I’m ready to give up on this opportunity which I don’t need to do because this is the foot I want into the outdoor industry. The easy solution would be go see a doctor get back on the pills and deal with being a zombie. Unfortunately being unemployed that is not an option for me. It’s just too damn expensive. What can I do to alleviate this pain? What have you guys done? I’m tired of laying in bed all day like a lump on a log feeling sorry for myself.

jacfearsome [info] I've found it is important to judge and analyze the person you plan to tell.  Practice telling them other secrets and see if others find out.  If the can't keep your confidence with small things, you certainly can't trust them with big things.  I was diagnosed with bipolar 4 years ago and have since then learned how to tell people.  I have slowly created a circle of friends that allow me to reveal my "crazy" (not the best word) self and not scare them away or get hurt by them.  From what I've seen people generally have a couple responses.1. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice to your face but then badmouth you to others.2. They acknowledge it and are polite/nice but then judge you or look down on you.3. They understand that they don't understand and listen with an open mind, and are gracious.

bathroomspaceman [info] Tracy reminds me so much of myself it's crazy. I was diagnosed with bipolar II three years ago and before I learned how to handle it better, I was always doing shit like this. Cutting off friends for no reason other than the fact that it felt appropriate. Deleting social media accounts, recreating them, deleting them again. I even had my number changed so nobody could contact me. I frequently dropped hobbies and picked them back up weeks or months later. Not to mention using substances to cope and having very real suicidal thoughts. All I can say is that I feel for Tracy. People who are downplaying this like "ThIs iS jUsT hOw He iS" really don't realize what they're doing by disregarding his clear mental illness. I hope he gets help soon. Bipolar really fucking sucks, and in my experience, making posts like this really is a cry for help.  [info] None [info] 1549500636
__sortof [info] Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.But honestly, I don't feel "disabled." I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word "disabled," its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!Also, I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it, and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.

Starting when I was 19, I would occasionally have episodes where time would slow down, everything felt unreal, and I could barely move or speak. Like, I couldn't physically make myself do it, even if I wanted to. I would also get vivid images and sounds in my head, sort of like a daydream, but far more intense and out of my control.I got a sleep-deprived EEG that turned up nothing. Later I spoke with a psychiatrist who thought they might be dissociative episodes. I was in a very dark period in my life, so it's not out of the question.A few years later I was diagnosed with bipolar II, and the medication I was prescribed for it is also used to treat epilepsy. I haven't had an episode since. It could be that my improved mental state meant that I stopped dissociating, but I'll probably never know for sure. [info] None [info] 1566066054
caramel_kiss [info] Um okay, do you have a medical degree? Because the professionals I've spoken to with medical degrees have said psychosis is a symptom of bipolar. I'm bipolar, I am diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features which is a real disorder. Psychosis is not a bad thing, so why are you so strongly rejecting the notion that bipolar people are psychotic? A lot of us are, it's just another medical symptom. It's like seizures, and epileptic people are also barred from many jobs because there's too much stimulus. [info] None [info] 1571114609
plainemily [info] The man I've been seeing said bipolar is a deal breaker. I am a 23 year old female and I was diagnosed with bipolar II 5 years ago. I stopped seeking treatment shortly after diagnosis until a few months ago. I hate being bipolar and I hate taking meds because I feel like it's admitting that there is something wrong with me.I have been seeing a new guy [28 M] for a little over a month. He brought up the subject of deal breakers and he specifically said being bipolar was a deal breaker.I thought I could hide it, at least until he saw the good things about me. I felt really guilty and I called him and told him. He seemed confused and just said we could talk today. He's been distant, but he didn't say he wants to stop seeing each other. I guess I was just wanting someone else's point of view. Should I stop seeing him for not accepting me? I wonder if he's even ever known anyone with this. Anyone been in a similar situation?

samthelibrarian [info] TL,DR: In love with another woman, still in "on again, off again" relationship.; cheating TL,DR: In love with another woman, still in "on again, off again" relationship.; cheating Bare with me - this is a long one. I am really looking for advice, not criticism. I have been with my current partner (Lee) going on 4 years. When we first met, I had been with someone else (Sara) and cheated on that person (Sara) with my current partner (Lee). I then cheated on my current partner (Lee) a few more times (with my previous ex - Sara). Somehow we made it through and continued to be together; there was a lot of paranoia, lack of trust, and other issues. But we kept going. Two years into the relationship Lee and I decided to move across country for a "fresh start". We planned to forgive and let go of the past and move forward completely fresh. Turns out, that plan failed and we still fought and experienced lack of trust (my issue) and transparency (me). We ended up breaking up for good in Jan 2018, but since she was not working and we owned a house together, we stayed in the same house but in different rooms. From Jan 2018 - Sept 2018, we tried to make things work. But still could not get into a rhythm. I decided to finally end things and after a few weeks I joined a dating site. (While on the dating site, the ex and I would be physical [hug, kiss on the cheek, sex a few times). However, I met a terrific girl (Maggie), we hit it off instantly and started to talk long distance. My ex (Lee), whom I'm still living with, was aware that my dating and really upset. I keep talking to Maggie and she ends up flying across country, just to take me out to dinner.  Maggie and I start dating, long distance, while I'm living with Lee (Maggie is aware of this). Meanwhile, I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 (hypo version) and Lee is blaming my lack of wanting a relationship with her and actions on having a hypo-manic episode.  Anyways, I fly out to see Maggie a few times, meet her family, spend time with her, and completely fall in love. Meanwhile, Lee is still texting to "check in" on me, telling me how much she misses me and hopes I'm doing well. At this point, I'm staying with Maggie and doubting my decision to fly out and stay with her. Maybe I should go back with Lee and try to make things work. So, I leave Maggie and head back across country. While I'm still with Maggie, Lee and I are flirting more, being physical, etc. I don't tell the Maggie. One day, I had a freak out and decided to move across country to be with the Maggie. I packed up as much as I could and drove 32 hours. I was so happy, giddy, in love, had all the feels. Lee continued to contact me, which I responded, and continued to tell me how much she missed and loved me. I spent the holidays with Maggie and had a wonderful time. Everything felt perfect. But I stayed in contact with the Lee. Later that month, I had another break down and decided to leave Maggie's and drive back across country to my house. Once I made it back home, Lee and I fell back into things (but I was still in a relationship with Maggie). Fast forwarded a few weeks later, I decide once again I am going to move across country for good this time. Meanwhile, I am now in a relationship with Lee and Maggie. I am trying to keep everything separated but ended up slipping and they both found out about one another. The Maggie was willing to give me another chance and wanted me to move in with her (roughly 4 months of dating/going back and forth). I packed up and started to drive across country once again. Maggie asked that I stop talking to Lee; but Lee sweet talked me into texting and letting her know I was okay along the way. Which I did. Maggie found out that I was still in contact with Lee, called me names I deserved and told me to go home. So I turned around and went back home. Once I returned, Lee and I got back together and I was supposed to block Maggie (which is now the ex). Of course I didn't and continued to talk to Maggie (telling her how much I love her, I want to be with her, want a second chance). Lee found out and made me tell Maggie that I was having a manic moment and that I needed to stop speaking with her. During all of this, I am seeing doctors to get my medication correct; seeing a therapist, etc. Prior to Lee recently finding out that I was talking to Maggie, Maggie told me I had 30 days to get my act together and then we can talk again. Here's my struggle and hopefully you can provide some advice -- I know I am in love with Maggie, however, I royally screwed things up. I want to email her and ask if I still have my 30 days to get my act together or if she's completely done. What would you do? Meanwhile, I feel no spark for Lee. You would never know it by my behavior and what I say; everything seems perfect, but inside, there's nothing. On the other hand, Lee is head over heels in love with me. Telling me that I'm her person, we're going to get married, etc. For whatever reason, I cannot bring myself to be honest with Lee and tell her my true feelings. I feel like I'm just kinda going with it...and not living my authentic self. So, fellow friends, what should I do? Should I take the chance and ask Maggie if there is still a possibility to mend that relationship (even with the cheating, lying, etc.) or should I let Maggie go? Would you tell Lee you're not into it anymore? Even though her love is unconditional but there's no spark on your side? (By the way, I know I am a piece of crap for acting the way I have.)Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated. [info] None [info] 1551822054
White-Fox110 [info] You ever feel super happy for a week or two? I was diagnosed with bipolar a while back, but my alcoholism really impaired the ability to have treatment for it. I attempted to quit drinking for a little bit last week and the week before that, and was able to do two days off, and let me tell you the withdraw hurt badly. But the medicine finally started working, and I felt amazingly happy! Then I failed a test, had a doctor's appointment that diagnosed me with either an unknown skin condition, and a friend who tried to fuck me up seriously. Now I am back to rock bottom, and back to passive suicidal. Life is amazing until your back to yourself. [info] None [info] 1539048650
godsbabyy [info] How to tell if it's bipolar or just me being an asshole? Hey guys,I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for 2 years now. I am not on meds. I never really took them long enough for me to tell a difference. My mood is constantly changing low to high and it affects me pretty badly. I am often violent or feel the need to express annoyance and frustration especially when I'm manic (hypomania). I'm easily irritated all the time and very easily turned off and annoyed. This obviously affects my relationships badly and I find myself hurting people and ruining things without realizing what I'm doing. It always has been like that. Lately, I just isolate myself when I feel like my irritability is increasing so I won't fuck up and hurt others again. I feel like I'm a shitty person who just ruins everything around them and I don't want to make my bipolarity an excuse for the things I do. I want to know what is caused by the disorder and what is just another issue that I need to work on.&amp;#x200B; So my question is: is this even normal for people with bipolar?  how do you tell if your reaction, feeling or mood is because of the disorder or if it's just your personality? and how do you control your increased irritability? Thank you. [info] None [info] 1556118740
tlcgogogo [info] Keep on going edit: CW for suicidal thoughts. I don’t post on Reddit often so I’m not sure how to add that. Sorry. How do you guys have the will to keep on going? I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 14 and I’ve struggled with it almost my entire life (I’m 20 now). How do you all find the will to keep on living?I feel like such a failure for some reason. I’m in college, have a good job, a loving boyfriend, a stable home life with my mom, but nothing ever seems to be enough and I destroy everything I touch. I seem to be on this cycle where I’m good for about 6 months and I start making good choices. I go to therapy, take my meds, find a job, go to class, etc etc etc. Then I get a down that lasts about 6 months where I lose my job, quit going to class, quit going to therapy and meds, and all that ‘fun’ stuff. I’m on a down right now. I’ve called out of work the last few days and nothing seems worth it. I’ve felt this way for weeks. My insurance is terrible and I pay 100$ for each visit with my doctor so it’s not like I can go see them all the time. I just don’t know what to do. I just want to end it. I’ve completely isolated myself from almost everyone, but all my friends seem to think that I am an amazing person because I try to keep my outside image put together when I’m struggling on the inside. I just am so lost. [info] None [info] 1562449042
NoCreativeInput [info] Hey, I have bpd and borderline. I was diagnosed with bipolar, 6 years ago, when I was 22. Bipolar used to run my life. I was constantly on am emotional roller coaster, going from happy to depressed and constantly having suicidal ideation.Now the focus in my life is how to treat my bpd symptoms as I have really bad fears of abandonment and I have started cutting. I am also on lamictal, I used to be on saphris. My life has drastically changed since I have been on meds that were prescribed for my bipolar. However, I am still depressed, feel lonely and empty- apparently that part can't be fixed for me. I just want to let you know, you aren't alone. [info] None [info] 1487023141
r3adyforanything [info] Not sure what to do with the volume of my voice and how fast I seem to talk My family always joked around about "what did she say" and various other phrases along the lines. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost a year and a half ago and it just seems to have gotten worse in a way?? My boyfriend is constantly frustrated with how loud I am. When I open my mouth, even I'm surprised with how loud it is. No matter how hard I try to focus I can't keep it down for long. My boyfriend gets really mad and I just decided to stop talking as often to avoid anything or feeling bad about it. My mind moves so fast all the time and jumps around from subject to subject as well. That's not too big of an issue, I can handle being like that but I can't handle not being able to control my volume. To top it off I have a deepish voice and so if I talk in a somewhat normal volume no one hears/understands me anyway!! I might as well just shut up forever there is no winning!!

SweetJade [info] Diagnosed with BDP and Bipolar Just a little background... When I was 23 I was diagnosed with bipolar. The diagnosis never completely fit and I felt that there was something missing. When I was 26 I ended up in a short stay mental facility for 11 days and the bipolar diagnosis was lifted and I was told that I had BPD. Borderline Personality Disorder fit better for me as a whole than bipolar did but I wasn't getting any better going through group therapy. I moved provinces and sought out help for my BPD which for me seemed to be aggravated with the stress of moving. I am currently in a 10 week group program here and today I spent my first decent amount of time with the shrink. As of today he believes that both BPD and bipolar are correct. On Monday he will meet with me to discuss medications. He has mentioned lithium. I was on Olanzapine the first time and it didn't go so well (massive weight gain and no energy)I was wondering if there was anyone here who may have an experience with BPD and bipolar or if anyone has had more success with Lithium than Olanzapine?

Indigocacti [info] Weed helped me with my mood swings before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and given lithium and it helped with reducing the frequency of my migraines. I did it not for those reasons and didn't even know it could help with that, I was just super stressed and turned to it.

vno3333 [info] Tips on dealing with the mood swings? Sooo, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 earlier this year. I’ve been on medication which DEFINITELY helps, but I still get monthly mood swings around that time of the month, and this month they’ve been worse than they have been in a while. I’m afraid that I feel myself slipping back to my old self, picking fights about every little thing. My mania tends to manifest as agitation and fights, which sucks cause I’m either normal, depressed, or angry lol no euphoric uppity mania. Anyway, does anyone have tips for how to stop their mood swings from taking over when you feel them coming on? I really don’t want to fight with the people in my life and I know it’s my responsibility, but at the moment I’m feeling a little out of control with things. [info] None [info] 1575041726
capn_krunk [info] Not sure what you were diagnosed with. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago. I tried the therapy and medication for a good year, and it didn't help much. The medicine made me lose all feeling. I'd rather feel good for a while and then bad for a while than nothing at all. I remember thinking, *Is this what it means to be normal?*Bouts of anger are part of my condition. All I can say is that I feel for you, and I love you. I truly hope things get better and better for you. Life is short. [info] None [info] 1421038933
hell_kat [info] Oh, my mom has borderline personality disorder (refuses meds/thinks shrinks do more harm than good), agoraphobia, food issues (former bulimic) and more!  She was a treat to grow up with.  My dad was better but enabled her and had different issues. Some gems:- "We thought your brother was going to be the screw up."  This was when I chose to be a stay at home mom.  The other women in the family were stay at home moms but not by choice.  I went to university and stayed home.  That pissed her off.  My brother had learning issues.- "If you ever try that fucking shit again, I'm going to have you locked in a mental institute."  At 13 I attempted suicide.  Apparently it was too much to worry about your kid when you have a lot going on.- Less of a specific comment and more of an incident.  My mother took me around to multiple diet clinics getting quotes for programs.  I was weighed, examined, etc.  Apparently I was getting 'fat'.  We didn't have money to join any of them and later than night she bought us pie.  The reason is resonates with me is that years later I saw a pic of me at that age.  I was perfect.  Truly.  I was taller than my mom, had bigger boobs and built very athletically.  Because I was 'bigger' than her, I was fat.  And that was the beginning of her obsession with my weight and issues.- 'Stop being so fucking high and mighty.  He is disabled and you need to fucking deal with it and stop being such a bitch.  You never liked him since the accident."  My disabled (with head trauma too) uncle started making sexual remarks to me and began asking me to sit on his lap.  I told the folks he freaked me out.  So many more but those are some of the best.  Thankfully I was diagnosed with bipolar and got to have YEARS of awesome therapy.  Also married an amazing guy and cut the crazies out 10 years ago.  To all my fellow redditors with shitty parents, life can get better.  And if nothing else, these are great tutors on how not to live your life!   [info] None [info] 1380291081
Mariahsmith [info] I know exactly how you feel. I'm one of the first ones in my family who did things, as my family says, "the right way." Meaning, I got married first and got my life somewhat together before our little one surprised us. So there's a LOT of pressure riding on me on how to raise my baby. I understand everyone's concern, but they're making me feel like I'm gonna fail miserably just because I'm younger (I'm 21, SO 25). But I think they're all freaking out because they think I'm MENTALLY unable to care for my own child. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so I had a rough childhood and adulthood so far, and have not exactly done anything right in their eyes until my husband came along and saved me. So now I can't help but thinking...am I going to be a fit mother? I was barely able to take care of my own emotions...now I have a little human depending on me and my husband and I'm just scared I won't be able to be the mother she needs =( the closer January gets, the more anxious I get about it [info] Lilith born 1/7/14 [info] 1380119877
antennas_to_heaven [info] Hi friend! I used ket both recreationally and medically (spiritually?) when I was diagnosed with bipolar and overcoming an emotionally abusive relationship (it also later helped me come to realizations regarding gender identity).It’s impossible for me to prescribe a purely medical route seeing as I love ket as a drug but I guess I would say the nights I spent listening to ambient in bed after shooting 80mg IM were some of the most constructive.In general I think ket helps you sort through thoughts and feelings without being attached to them in the moment. At a show, I snorted 300mg (I have a moderately stupid tolerance, don’t do that) and fell into a deep hole in the corner thinking about my ex and just letting the thought “I don’t feel bad for her and I don’t need to” sit in my head. I picture the brain like a knotted ball of yarn; ketamine expands the spaces and pauses time so you can slowly un-knot that ball. If I had any specific recommendation it would be to meditate on things that have hurt you or made you feel worthless while decenty ketty but not in the hole.Also in order to IM you *have* to get it out of a sterile vial. Some people use micron filters but at that point I’d rather IV. Don’t want any bullshit stuck in your muscle tissue. Side note, if you want to avoid needles plugging 150-250mg in your ass feels VERY similar, it just wastes a lot of k but it lasts several hours.Source: am no longer suicidal :) [info] None [info] 1548782582

NotDeeReynolds [info] Am I classed as a vulnerable adult? And would a healthcare provider be legally obligated to report a rape if I sought help/a check up, if so? I'm really hoping to receive some advice here that I'm struggling to find online. Please no judgemental comments, I'm in a really bad place now and I know I made some poor choices. I didn't plan for any of this to happen though. I was diagnosed with bipolar over a decade ago. It's been a struggle over the years but I had generally been doing well. Until last year, when I ended up being hospitalised after a draining long manic period. Earlier this year, I found myself in the same position again, though this time I was much a lot erratic apparently and the 'episode' was much shorter. I was reported missing and classed as a vulnerable adult. What I'm wanting to know is if I would still be classed as a vulnerable adult, and if so, would a doctor or nurse be legally obligated to report a violent sexual attack that happened to me if I went to get checked out? I don't feel that I should be classed as a vulnerable adult, I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions right now. I'm concerned though that Sundays events would go against me looking as though I am capable of looking after myself. I don't want to go into it but for a little context I was put through an almost 2 hour violent and degrading attack on Sunday night. The company I work for has recently agreed to a deal with a big client. It was big enough news for them to organise an event/party and for three of the bosses from the US site to fly over. Over the past couple of years I've gotten to know the US team. One of the bosses and I really hit it off the last time he was here in the UK. It went to further as he is married. This time I very stupidly put my morals aside and agreed to go back to an apartment he was staying in in the city centre. Once we got there I had started to think and have second thoughts. I told him it wasn't a good idea, then it all happened very suddenly from there. He said I knew exactly what I was doing and that I shouldn't have gone there if I wasn't expecting sex. I feel sick even thinking that he's right because I would be mortified hearing anybody else agree to that. I made the choice to go with him though. I called in sick yesterday and today. I thought I was having a heart attack at the thought of going in yesterday. I've pretty much stayed in bed. My ribs and abdomen are sore and my back really hurts. I've got bruises across my body, including my cheek and jaw area where I can remember him grabbing my face and pushing me down. But I'm really hurting and uncomfortable down there.. I think I might need to be checked over but I don't now whether I would need to go to my doctor, or a walk-in. I don't know whether they would be legally obligated to break confidentiality if I am classed as a vulnerable adult, which I don't think I am technically legally classed as that. Surely I would know? I don't want to report this right now. I don't feel like I can go through people not believing me over him. He said he will ruin me if I told anybody it was anything but us having fun. I think I scratched him when I tried to get him off me. Can he use that against me? He claimed right after that we just had rough sex and made me repeat what he said. I have no back up to what happened. There were people staying in at least one of the apartments above or below I could hear loud music. I don't know if they would have heard anything. I don't want to have to talk about what happened. I just want it to end. I don't to know what do about work tomorrow. I haven't seen anybody or spoken to anybody, apart from leaving a message with work to say I wouldn't be in. I work with my SIL and she's been messaging asking if I'm okay. Can anything be reported on my behalf if I get checked out? [info] None [info] 1565124919
Elisebruni [info] You sound like you are dealing with real issues that are probably separate from ADHD. I don't think the average inferiority complex fully explains the feelings of worthlessness and self-hatred you are having. Please get some help, and don't listen to people who tell you to stop being dramatic/ suck it up/ get over it. I used to hate myself for having ADHD, but then I was diagnosed with bipolar and realized the feelings I was having were due to that (but I misattributed them to ADHD).When I was diagnosed bipolar, my father gave me some really good advice- "You have to play the cards you're dealt in life." It really doesn't matter what we were born with, because someone else always has it worse, and you can either obsess over your shortcomings or focus on living a good life. --&gt; I don't write that as a means of saying "suck it up," but because it was personally inspirational for me to hear.Good luck, and I hope you get to a better place.

calypsocasino [info] And I’ll gloss over this part for sake of time (and would like to devote more time to it), but from roughly August 2014 to August 2016, I nosedived like a Japanese kamikaze pilot trying to honor his famiree.I’ll fill it in later, but I had gained 67 lbs, was addicted to clonazepam that was prescribed immediately after my sibling’s suicide to numb the existential terror that became my life, I couldn’t hold a part time minimum wage job, I used substances around the clock, I never exercised, I blamed everyone, I manipulated everyone, I victimized myself, I became suicidal, I moved home with my parents at age 26 (600 miles from a social life and my girlfriend), I was diagnosed with bipolar and clinical OCD (“severe;” one step below hospitalization), I had no prospect for the future, and I wrote myself off as “well, it was a good run.” Last week I was dumped by girlfriend of 4 years - and I can’t blame her. She was the candle that got me through the midnight hurricane that was my life for 3 years, all while sacrificing her last year of college - throwing away time despite being in her 20’s,  gorgeous, and an intelligent young woman. And for that, I am forever indebted. I stopped all substances when I moved home - not that I had a choice, my parents weren’t exactly going to let me rip a bong and vape all day if I couldn’t hold a job. They didn’t mind, however, if I had a couple beers on a friday night - as long as I was exercising and dieting all week, working hard at my therapy sessions (and nightly journals I had to write), and putting effort into taking care of myself and my image. And when I mean a couple beers, I mean 2, MAYBE 3. In college I knew when I could and couldn’t party, because the pre med grind was insane. Let’s visit that. Alcohol is terrible for me. In college, after two weeks of hitting the gym, the books, and everything else hard as fuck, I’d relax and go out for a night. And I’d go out HARD. My friends loved the nights I had off - “Is this is a Tommy night?! It is!” They were stuff of legend. And other stuff I can’t talk about because of statutes of limitations, but we’ll forget about that and look through rose colored welding masks. When I’d drink, the first feeling I would get is “everything is going to be ok,” not “Time to enjoy a weekend with my friends, life is beautiful.”  Which never raised a flag to me at the time - I had always got that feeling. And it wasn’t a feeling reassuring me that I was going to get into medical school - just that life in general would be okay. But even then, that wasn’t in a good way, like a drink on a plane just to calm someone down. It was buffering internal problems. And then holy fuck, the hangovers. Physically it wasn’t all that horrific - sure I’d have a headache and jet black diarrhea. My shits would be role play: me acting as BP, and my toilet the Gulf of Mexico. My asshole connected to the Gulf by a solid column of greasy black biohazard filth that had the consistency of refried beans mixed with motor oil, and killed any aquatic life in the sewage system, their demise brought on by an onslaught of organic diesel death, which I can only imagine visually mushroomed and swirled like death's cloak through the water, like watching printer ink dropped in an aquarium tank full of water so crystal clear that Water Boy would have an aneurysm.

bioviolin [info] Hoping for Happiness The past year has been really difficult for me. I moved twice, started university, and basically created a new life for myself. I was under immense stress and my mental health declined until I was diagnosed with bipolar in May. I've spent the last few months doing damage control for all of the things I screwed up before I got my diagnosis and started getting treatment. Because of all of that, I became even more depressed and my outlook on life became intensely pessimistic. I could only see a future of damage control for all of my mistakes and neglected to see all of the good things that came out of this difficult year. I moved to a new place and became a student at my dream university. I survived the year with okay grades and a summer research position. During this difficult time, my friends and family supported me more than they ever have before. I started treatment and have an amazing doctor and therapist. I'm starting to see improvements since I started taking medication. I've spent the past few months doing damage control, but I'm much better equipped now with coping skills and life skills to support myself in the future. I have so much hope now. Sending all the good vibes to this incredible community. TLDR: The past year was really difficult, I became (even more) depressed and pessimistic, I'm changing my outlook on the future and hoping for happiness [info] None [info] 1565202529
birdcafe [info] I’m so ashamed of the things I did while hypomanic TW: Sexual harassment, brief mention of assaultMy first hypomanic episode happened when I was 16 (I’m 22 now) It was 5 months after my mom died by suicide. Obviously that was very traumatic and definitely influenced my spiral downward.Here’s what happened: I was on a high school choir retreat. I did some very inappropriate things to other girls. I have no idea why. I thought it was playful and funny at the time. I slapped a girl on her butt and another girl I kissed during truth or dare when she didn’t want it. I was up all night playing candy crush and that pissed people off too.I got kicked out of choir 3 weeks later. And I spiraled into horrible, horrible depressed, worst I’ve ever experienced. Almost tried to overdose on Tylenol until I read online it is a horrible way to die. So I told my dad and he took me to a psych ward. I went to the ward again 3 months later (still depressed).My dad had to go through so much bc of this. He had to watch his daughter be suspended from school and kicked out of the choir she loved because she literally sexually harassedpeople. I don’t know how he wasn’t disgusted with me.At the second hospitalization, I was diagnosed with bipolar II. Suddenly my actions made sense. But it didn’t make the shame go away.In the current climate of #MeToo, there is no tolerance for sexual harassment. I support that. I have been a victim of assault twice in college. Which only makes me feel more horrible that I victimized these girls, one of whom disclosed she was sexually abused as a child. I made them feel so uncomfortable and unsafe.I can only discuss this in the context of being bipolar. No one else understands. How you can do these things when manic/hypomanic that you would never do when stable. How you cannot possibly defend yourself. I still feel like a monster because of it sometimes. It damaged my self-image and it has taken years to try and repair it.Anyway, I hope someone can relate. :-/ At least I didn’t spend $6k on video games &amp; paying for characters/weapons like my friend’s brother during a manic ep.

boxer21 [info] I have boxed for 20 years, competed for 7.  I competed at the National Golden Gloves in 2004 losing in the second round to Shawn Porter’s older brother.  I always struggled with competition.  The pressure I put on myself would lead me into a dark downward spiral.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of years ago.  I still box nearly everyday (I’m 36).  I’m a good fighter and it’s heartbreaking to feel like my talent is going to waste, but mental illness fucks you very hard.  I’ve learned to just box for fun but I still take it very seriously.  I think I’m actually a better fighter simply because I don’t have that pressure on me and feel I can be more creative with my style.  I fly out to LA three to four times a year to workout at the Wildcard.  I spar frequently with top caliber fighters and I get my fill.  I love boxing.  It now helps me manage my mental health issues rather than intensifying them.  It’s crazy because when I’m manic and on a high I can go 10 good rounds. When I’m in a depressive state I barely have the energy to go 2.  Bipolar Disorder doesn’t just make you feel like shit mentally, it manifests itself physically as well. [info] None [info] 1525214153

Crocodilesclimbtrees [info] I was diagnosed yesterday. Hi everyone I was diagnosed with bipolar2 and PTSD yesterday. After my bipolar disorder is stabilized my doctor's will test me for ADHD. I'm posting to ask what you guys experienced when you started medication? Did some of you have a long trial and error process while finding the right medication and dose?Should I expect to get worse before I feel "normal"?Your stories and insight/advice are appreciated.If any of you have ADHD and are also Bipolar2, I would appreciate it if you would also share. I never thought I was Bipolar or had PTSD. I thought I was Just anxious or self conscious and had ADHD. I will look into my diagnosis online, but I am more interested in the experiences and insight you all have at the moment.Thank you for reading, and thank you for sharing in advance.

GoldenOreoFilling [info] Thanks for the information! I actually do have a lot of problems with medications either not working or having bad side effects, which is why I'd like to get tested. I'm diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had so many issues with so many meds that I chose to undergo ECT treatments about 10 years ago. I've also got severe chronic pain of unknown etiology. After 20+ years of trial-and-error (I'm 34), I'm stuck with opioids as the only thing that helps and nobody will prescribe them to me so I'd at least like a potential idea of why things may not be working.

3and202 [info] Extreme irritability and anger after concussion I had a workplace accident where a forklift crashed into a metal cage and the thick bar on the side (approx the thickness of a crowbar handle) crashed into the side of my head at 20mph, at first I felt very tired with a splitting headache and now I'm just experiencing severe moodswings made even worse since I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder 2 months ago, can anyone advise how long these mood swings normally last for? Things that wouldn't normally bother me even when having a depressive episode are causing me extreme anger to the point of feeling suicidal or like crying mixed in with feelings of euphoria for a few minutes and it's becoming very unbearable.

twandar [info] I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago and blamed my impulsivity on that. I also drank heavily in my mid 20's and blamed a lot of my bad behavior on that. But even for a drunk my behaviors were extreme and when I sobered up I sought excitement more through risky sex. I didn't think anything of it in this day and age of Tinder. My behaviors just never seemed out of the ordinary to me because they were my norm. Just recently, I've been diagnosed with bipolar rapid cycling and it has been hard to believe at first. It's helped me a lot to track my moods, consult my journals, and ask others for their observations. By tracking my moods I can see that they change every few days and sometimes even within a day, just like a switch was flipped. My memory and perception is so fucked up that I honestly just think I'm always angry and depressed. But tracking my moods proves differently. Reading back through years and years of journals as an observer of my behavior was mind blowing. I didn't think I was ever happy, but there were lots of manic entries where I thought I was destined to be a super hero with my special powers. Or that I understood the world and everyone better than others. There were also these weird delusional relationships with men I was crushing on. I don't remember any of that because those moods have passed. Asking others their observations about my "craziest behaviors" got interesting results as well. My brother reports a seemingly normal brunch on mother's day. He thought I was totally out of control and ruining everything. I thought it was a normal outing. My drunk friend who still drinks like we did in college reports a few very disturbing nights in college. I was extreme even amongst our group of friends who all prided ourselves on drinking more than others. I think that's why I clung to them. My insane behavior was more often seen as amusing rather than disturbing to a room full of binge drinkers. I agree with others above that if 3 different doctors suggest it, it's most likely pretty obvious. I don't think there's anything to gain by denying the diagnosis. My life only got harder, not easier. I waited way too long to believe I really needed help, until I was at my breaking point and desperate. So, I think a diagnosis is powerful. Knowledge can help you better understand and manage the disorder. I've learned so much about myself in this last month. I regret not slowing down to figure this shit out 20 years ago. Live and learn I suppose. Good luck on your journey of discovery. [info] None [info] 1505441509
Pamela_Poovey [info] &gt;I think if you try to cutaway at yourself trying to define what is and is not apart of you, you end up with nothing left of yourself.  Descartes takes this tack in his *First Philosophy* and ended up caught in a dualistic construct that required the mind (consciousness) to exist separate from the body.  Then there's the question about whether our properties define who we are, or if who we are defines these properties. And, which of these properties is essential or accidental.  Is water wet because it is water, and could it be water without being wet.  Are you bipolar because of who you are, and could you be who you are without having bipolar?I never thought about it like this before. I was diagnosed with bipolar II mid-year and although between Zoloft, Lamictal and a ton of therapy, I am in a relatively good place, I still struggle with trying to differentiate between what I can attribute to my personality and what I can attribute to the chemical imbalance in my brain. I try to be the best person I can be and not blame any shitty behaviour that I demonstrate on my illness but I still sometimes wonder.As silly as it sounds, it never occurred to me that the effects of my illness could be *a part of* my personality. That doesn’t give me the right, of course, to behave like an asshole and say “bipolar made me do it” but I think it would be a lot more productive in terms of addressing my mental health if I were to consider the impact that my illness has on my personality rather than trying to separate the two. This is a great insight. [info] None [info] 1512046094
bbbastardchild [info] The thing is, I was diagnosed with bipolar like last year? Recently  got medication for it and that was the best thing, I had the worst manic episodes. And as far as MDD that was diagnosed awhile ago before Bipolar, so I don't know really. I haven't had the best luck with prescribers ether. And exactly! Since BPD isn't official it's a lot harder. I was seeing the only specialist here that would take us. There was two groups and both were just adults so I couldn't go in and that's that for BPD, unfortunately.

aidrocsid [info] Well, for one, I developed a lot of irrational fears and would completely freak out when forced to confront them. Much of the time it felt more like I was watching myself act than actually participating in my life, which was frustrating. My memory, which, for events (though not information) had already been pretty bad, became far worse. I started having difficulty in school (which I'd always excelled at) and having emotional problems. I was frequently in what I now recognize as a mixed state, though whether that was caused by ritalin or just an early symptom of my bipolar (I), I couldn't tell you. I sometimes, because of the timing, suspect that ritalin may have initiated my bipolar to begin with or (though less so now) that the ADHD was just misdiagnosed bipolar. Once I stopped taking ritalin my emotional problems became more acute but it actually felt like *I* was the one experiencing them. Within a couple of years of stopping ritalin I was diagnosed with bipolar I with symptoms of psychosis in mania, they also said I might have borderline personality disorder but I didn't meet as many of the criteria as they like for diagnosis. I went through a number of anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics, none of which did anything other than make my life more difficult by putting me to sleep. Eventually I'd discover that I could mitigate my symptoms with marijuana and meditation.Recently, actually, I quit smoking tobacco and have seen an increase in bipolar symptoms, though the coping methods I've developed make it easier to function than it was when they were previously at these levels. Mind you, I also haven't really been meditating actively. [info] None [info] 1283865691

two__sheds [info] I started taking responsibility for my actions and how they affect other people.I have a long history of shitty behaviour.  When I was in my early 20s, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD, among other things.  I fell into a trap that I see many people with mental illnesses or personality disorders fall into.  All of a sudden there was a reason for everything!  If I hurt those around me, it wasn't my fault, it was my illness. What I really needed was for everyone to understand why I was acting the way I was. If they were upset with me it was their fault for not researching my illnesses and understanding my behaviour.Unsurprisingly, that didn't work out so well. My family stopped taking to me, I lost most of my friends and my then-fiancé started threatening to leave me if I didn't at least try to sort my shit out.  At some point, something clicked: my brain might be broken, and that's not my fault, but I don't get a pass on shitty behaviour because of it.  It wasn't up to everyone else to put up with my bullshit, it was up to me to minimize how much my disorders affected everyone around me.  That was the big turning point for my life.Tips for doing it yourself: recognize that explanations are not excuses. When something goes wrong, take steps to try to keep it from happening again.  You might not be perfect, but with practice you can keep the slip ups to a minimum.  People are much more willing to forgive you if they see real effort being put forth. [info] None [info] 1524537132
Twenty8k [info] [REQ] $800 to keep from going homeless. Full situation inside. Will repay minimum $225 every 2 weeks to repay you $900 in total. So, I lost my job due to medical reasons and have been scraping by on unemployment. I was diagnosed with bipolar and insomnia last year, and had a very hard time adjusting to medications, while the side effects of blood pressure drops were taking place too. My unemployment runs out next week, but fortunately I landed a really nice job, but I won't be able to start until March 25th. The $800 will go strictly to my mortgage, which is running behind. I have some to put into it already, but I'll be at risk of losing the house if I don't catch up entirely... My wife is still currently looking for a job after she was laid off for downsizing recently, but since I'll be bringing in $18/hr full time with possible overtime (which I'll be aggressively going for anyway when i can) so repayment will be no issue whatsoever. I have until March 29th to get the payment in to avoid losing the house... I have already contacted section 8 and all other local assistance groups (salvation army and related as well) but none are accepting new applications till around may or June, and section 8 wants me to have already started a job first before they'll even accept an application, but by then it'll be needless. I can start repayments around the first or 2nd week of April at the absolute latest. I am in Reading, PA area. Thanks. PayPal ok. [info] None [info] 1426564113

Overclockinggirl [info] I am so sorry you’re going through this and it probably breaks your heart that you cannot physically get to her because of your disability. My mother was disabled and I know it would’ve broken her heart if she couldn’t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn’t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn’t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I’m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I’m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don’t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren’t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I’m a totally different person. It can scare people away and make them feel uncomfortable. If you have any other questions, feel free to direct message me. I hope this helped. [info] None [info] 1574551417
jamesick [info] It's extremely easy to get diagnosed with adhd and bipolar by a doctor just from telling them your symptoms which means absolutely nothing. Not to say you don't have these, you may do, but more often than not a doctor just telling you do doesn't mean you do. Everyone and their dog these days seems to have bipolar which is a mental condition and can't just be diagnosed from you telling a doctor your symptoms. Just like most other illnesses it takes more than just saying what you feel to be properly diagnosed with it. Have you had any serious tests like brain scans or anything that could actually give a doctor a reason to diagnose you with these?I don't mean to be rude, it's just everyone thinks they have bipolar or adhd because they told their doctor they feel happy sometimes and sad sometimes and their doctor mentioned bipolar. I've been diagnosed with bipolar and it was absolute bullshit and I know I don't have it. More often than not its just normal the way you're feeling and you shouldn't feel like you have something you don't. If you think you have adhd and/or bipolar you will eventually let that rule your life. Try not accepting it and continue your life as if you were never diagnosed with it, if you still feel you do have it look further into it than just a GP's "you seem to have bipolar".

MrsDukeNasty [info] Recently Diagnosed I'm new here. Hi. ☺ I'm 31 and I've struggled with mental illness all my life. I had an extremely traumatic childhood on several fronts. I've tried to reach out multiple time in my life but I've always been inconsistent. As a teen I was diagnosed with bipolar, put on antidepressants.. Never took them. Turned to drugs, spent my 20s as an addict. Got my shit together 6 years ago, married a great man. He quickly became concerned about my behaviors and because of that and his excellent insurance I sought care once again. This time being diagnosed with DID and manic depressive disorder. I'm now going to weekly therapy and monthly psychologist appointments. I'm taking Cymbalta and Geodon. Things are defintely better with these meds. I've only been on them a few weeks though so I can't say for sure.Anyone take the same meds? Have anything to share? Idk anyone else with DID so id love any advice or input.

c_grover [info] Want to end suffering I didn't know this subreddit existed until a few minutes ago, so I apologize if I violate any rules, but this seems like the right place for how I'm feeling.I have been dealing with my mental illness since I was 11 years old. I'm 20 now, so it's been half my life, and almost all of my life that I can remember. I'm diagnosed with bipolar. I have tried so many treatments, including over a dozen stays at inpatient psychiatric facilities, over 40 different medications, everything from SSRIs to antipsycotics to mood stabilizers. I've also tried electroconvulsive therapy, cranial sacral therapy, hypnosis, and pretty much every type of talk therapy that there is. None of it has worked for more than a couple months at most, so I feel like there's no hope for me to get better, and I don't even want to try anything else, because the more time that passes, the worse I get. In the past year, I had a suicide attempt that put me in a coma, 3 inpatient stays, over a dozen different medications, and over a dozen ECT treatments. After all that, all I want is to be dead. I hate myself, and I think that I'm a terrible person. I think the world would be a better place if I wasn't in it. [info] None [info] 1475966051

Tortitudes [info] NMom Flipping Out Over Me Requesting Medical Records I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder at the age of 17. I was admitted into a mental health hospital at the time, was prescribed a mood stabilizing medication specifically for my condition, spent about a week adjusting to it (it made me really sleepy), got some therapy, and went home. I took this medication for about a year, under her care, under her insurance, with her picking it up and giving it to me to take.Now about 12 years later, she keeps making comments about "oh this person is f*king nuts and bipolar" so I finally told her to cut it out, asking why do you have to keep saying stuff like that in front of me? So upon reminding her of my diagnosis, both her and my brother (who honestly usually sides with me on her antics, which makes it hurt so much) told me that a) nobody told my mother that I had bipolar disorder and b) I must be lying because I don't seem bipolar. Also the medication I was taking could be used as a sleep aid or schizophrenia as well. So I guess I was placed in a mental hospital for a week to get used to a sleeping pill? Sure, sure.Okay, so I guess when your teenage daughter would stay up all night for a couple nights in a row organizing your fabric by type and color and cleaning our house, that's not being manic. When you would yell at your daughter for talking too fast, that's not being manic. When you would scream at your daughter for being in bed for three days and can't bring herself to even shower properly, that's not being depressed.And being that she's gaslighting me and telling me my diagnosis and memories aren't real, I'm paranoid and starting to think I'm freaking crazy and started to try and get these medical records so I can be sure I'm not "making stuff up again." She calls me yesterday and got angry with me because I sounded distracted. I was reading the steps I had to take on the network website and told her what I was doing. She immediately got weird with me and hung up the phone. I just figured it was because we weren't talking about her per usual. I didn't even tell her I was getting them so I could prove her wrong. I just phrased it as, "I'm almost 30, I should probably have my medical history at some point."Now she's calling me today and asking me if I really want to make sure I want to get those records in case my husband reads them.  She's using some things in my past against me to try and talk me out of getting them. I can't imagine there's something in there that I'm not supposed to see, or something that would be weird against her, so I'm not sure why she's trying to scare me out of getting them. And anything in the past that might show up on my records, my husband already knows. So nice try, lady.I don't plan on shoving these in her face. It will be of no use to do so. I just want them because I should honestly probably have them, and to reassure me I'm not making stuff up in my head. If I wanted to shove them in her face, I'd be sure to include the emergency room visit I had after miscarrying since she thinks I made that up too.I'm just confused on her angle and why she doesn't want me to have my own medical records.

facefulloffuzz [info] Mental health is a good point and I agree. I just struggle on what would disqualify someone. After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I surrendered my fire arm to the local police department. Had no legal obligation to do so but I just wanted to ensure safety for everyone. Last thing I would ever want to is to be off my rocker with a gun in my hand. Probably not likely, but always safe than sorry. [info] None [info] 1565305103
le_fez [info] At 38 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after two decades of not knowing, understanding or necessarily caring what was going on with me. I had self medicated and destroyed relationships, friendships and other parts of my life for 20 years but understanding what the root cause was and learning how to control it has made all the difference. I've never used my condition as an excuse for the things I did even though it was the cause the fact that I knew something wasn't right and had many people try to convince me to see help leaves the blame for my actions on me and not the disorder [info] None [info] 1488117199
MegaLoser2 [info] Should I just drop out and get my GED? I'm a senior in high school, and the past 2 years or so my mental health has been declining. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 6 months ago. My school attendance is rock bottom. I haven't gone in 4 weeks. My dad doesn't really know what to do. He thinks I'm just gonna fail I guess. I'm not stupid. Before all this mental health stuff I got straight A's and my assessment scores were in the top percentiles. I know that I could pass the GED test in 1 try, probably without even really studying. I have a job, and have been working steadily for over a year. I'm not lazy either. I just can't take school anymore. I see a therapist, I'm on meds, I'm just done. I've been done for 2 years, and people keep telling me to tough it out. I've tried toughing it out and I keep getting worse. I just wanna drop out and be done [info] 16 [info] 1578296455

I have been out of work since February, and I know there is no way I will be able to work full time again any time soon, if ever. Even with all of my evidence, I did decide to file my initial claim through a lawyer with a high success rate who has collects a fee upon winning the case.

TheRoyalGodfrey [info] yeah the way kanye talks about mental health isn't really accurate or healthy. Like I remember in his interview with Charlamagne, Charlamagne asked him if he sees a therapist and he said "the world is my therapist."And the ye cover is perpetuating the misleading stereotype around bipolar disorder that you just constantly switch between manic and depressive but usually cycles last for 3-6 months. Ultra-rapid (cycles lasting days) and ultradian (cycles within a day) are very very rare.It's also unclear whether Kanye actually has bipolar disorder. At the White House, he said "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain. I wasn't actually bipolar, I had sleep deprivation" but now he's back to saying he has it. Which (I don't wan to armchair diagnose but) he probably does. [Mariah Carey has bipolar disorder](https://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bipolar-disorder-diagnosis-exclusive/) and she's talked about how he wanted to believe it was just sleep deprivation for a while.It feels like Kanye is trying to use his mental illness to guilty people while not even treating it properly and spreading harmful misconceptions about BPD. A lot of the stuff he's been saying about not listening to other people and being "free" sounds like feeding into a manic episode. Like the song "Freee" and saying "bipolar is my superpower" sound like embracing the mania which seems ill advised.Also that Gucci/Quavo song doesn't destigmatize BPD at all [info] None [info] 1544908543
nmsims [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar two back in 2013 but I figured I was before I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist I willingly went to on my own. I’m a CPA and have a masters degree. I’m 33 and am successful depending on how you define it. The dr was surprised that I got by as well as I had without treatment. To that point. I told her I’ve always just thought I had problems that couldn’t be resolved and even though things felt hard and like I had to try hard I just tried hard.  I was out on some different meds but didn’t feel differently after the adjustment phase. I eventually stopped taking anything and went back to self managing. I always had trouble organizing my thoughts and communicating concisely and to the point. Mainly cause I feel like I have a million thoughts in my head just running through my mind faster than I can speak. I have a really hard time focusing on simple things cause my thoughts are very complex. That’s the one thing I wish I could change cause I think it has caused some to not take me as seriously. I didn’t know this was a bi polar symptom but I just read it. I now want to ask my psychiatrist if she can prescribe me bi polar meds. I’m on adderall right now and have been for about 8 months. It gets me focused but I can’t wrangle my thoughts. I just found this Reddit page today which I’m glad about. Seems like so many really understand bi polar disorder and their quirks at a deep level. I’d like to be able to do the same. [info] None [info] 1556763204

MoonbeamThunderbutt [info] I never considered that my diagnosis could be wrong either, but when I finally read the BPD criteria (more than a decade after my bipolar diagnosis), I was flabbergasted. BPD makes so much more sense for me in retrospect. The criteria fit so much better, but most of all: BPD is a result of trauma. It's a manifestation of CPTSD.Bipolar is treated more like a genetic illness, like schizophrenia. It's treatable but incurable and "just happens" to some people, like a random chance force of nature. At this point, I'm angry that I was ever diagnosed with it, because I was actively being abused and neglected when I got that diagnosis. Did my fucking therapist not see that? I was doing the best I possibly could in a completely intolerable, psyche-breaking situation. The fault was with the people putting me in that situation, not me for trying to survive it. And yet, I was diagnosed with bipolar, which is really just a way of saying "Your brain is defective and you shouldn't trust yourself. The abuse is your fault, because you're too difficult to handle. You drive people to treat you badly and who can blame them."*Fuck. That. Shit.*Some people might consider BPD to be a "worse" diagnosis, but for me it gave me back my dignity and allowed me to trust myself again. I didn't cause any of this. I'm not defective. I've just been doing the best I can with very limited resources. [info] INFJ . F . 29 . 5w4 [info] 1465510625

dogmama5 [info] I need advice Back in February I was admitted to an inpatient psych ward for suicidality. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and honestly my life really started to make sense knowing the diagnosis. I spent two weeks in the hospital and then was discharged. Since then I got back up on my feet, started taking latuda (a miracle med), ate better, got an emotional support dog, lost 20 pounds just taking better care of myself, and really felt alive again. My therapist even graduated me to once per month sessions. My family was thrilled.However, lately I can feel myself slipping back. It’s like a relapse. I can’t get out of bed in the morning, I’m missing work, I’m sleeping all day and feel half awake. I gained all the weight back and then some. I feel like I can’t go on anymore and every day feels heavier and heavier. How can I live with this dread every day for the rest of my life? I’ve pushed my family away because they just don’t understand. Financially I’m a mess. I just can’t seem to see the light. I’m afraid to tell my support system that I’m suicidal again. Not like I was quite as bad, but I feel it creeping back in. I don’t want to let them down and become a burden again like I was while I was hospitalized and on suicide watch. I know this is part of the disorder but I just don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to go back and do the partial hospitalization program where I get therapy sessions and psychiatry every day for two weeks but I can’t miss any more work because I’ve already been coming in late and missing days and my boss is unhappy with me. I’m struggling to find a way to put my mental health first. Please help. [info] None [info] 1578632250
zevondhen [info] Has Anyone Else Ever Experienced This? (Please excuse the length and disorganized nature of this post--it's a bit difficult for me to articulate myself at the moment) I was diagnosed with bipolar type II when I was 18 (although I was 15 when I first displayed symptoms) and I have brief hypomanic episodes followed by long stretches of depressed episodes, but I also experience another aspect that I've never heard anyone ever talk about. I've never been able to really describe it, but I suppose it's sort of like the feeling you get smelling your favorite perfume or tasting the best food or being a kid on Christmas morning but about *everything*. All sensory information. All the time. It's this overwhelming euphoric sense that quickly peaks within a day or two and then takes a sharp dive into being overwhelming (think a wire with far too much current running through it) and this sensation can linger for *years*. It might not sound all that bad, but it's mostly because I lack the ability to fully describe it. I've experienced suicidal episodes, panic attacks, intense grief after losing a sister to suicide, and PTSD flashbacks and this... ordeal is up there with the worst mental states I've ever been in.One vivid example I can think of is when I visited a house where the living room was entirely mustard yellow--the tablecloth was yellow, the drapery was yellow, the carpet was yellow, even the bricks in the fireplace were yellow. I felt extremely uncomfortable and it was like having to smell the mustiest, most cloying old lady perfume through a dirty dish rag (I didn't literally *smell* this, but it's the closest I can get to explaining how it felt). It also seems to be triggered by the transition from winter to spring and summer to fall and I suppose it might have something to do with a subconscious reaction to sensory input. It's so sensitive that one day in late February to early March I will walk outside, stop, and think "yep, spring is coming." Now I know a sense of mania/hypomania can include feelings of euphoria, but I haven't seen anyone describe anything quite like this. I'm sure with seven billion people on the planet I can't possibly be the only person with this issue but I've never read any literature, seen any media, or read any posts about anything similar. I have had psychiatrists say that they don't know what's going on in my brain or what to do about it. I don't even have the *language* to fully capture it and I feel terribly alone in a state that can be absolutely debilitating.I just want to know if this sounds familiar to *anyone* out there because if I could find just one person who understands, it would help.

Mollysaurus [info] I went to an eating disorders unit first, which is where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I. My episodes were mostly manic; I suffered only a few depressive episodes in my life.

bookstorekiller [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in my early twenties. I went on medication, was in therapy for a bit, etc, but reading Wishful Drinking was the one most helpful thing I ever did to come to terms with it and accept it and have fun with it (so to speak).

cdahmedeh [info] I can't seem to get anything finished I once read that this is a subtle sign of bipolar disorder.My life is full of unfinished projects. Unfinished side-projects, unfinished code, unfinished electronic stuff in my workshop, unfinished writings, unread books, a huge list of ideas never executed on, habits abandoned and so on.At first, I get this great idea and lots of motivation to get started. I start planning, writing ideas, developing, buying things I need, telling others about my new great project, and so on.A few days later, I'm completely uninterested in what I was doing. I look at my unfinished work and have no desire to complete it. I give up easily over trivial issues and have the desire to destroy my hard work.Later on, the cycle repeats with a new idea. I feel really sad over all this unfinished stuff I have. I wish I could get it done.Does anyone else go through this? For those who actually get to finish line, how do you make it there? I already use a todo list everyday to help me somewhat but it's easy to fall behind it.I'm diagnosed with bipolar schizoaffective disorder and I'm on lithium, latuda and clonazepam.

dandycat13 [info] My MIL is a food and cookware hoarder and I'm tired of it I am 34 years old and my wife and I live with her mother.  We have lived in this house for 3 years with her and I reached the end of my rope a long time ago but I finally just got m wife on board last night. Firstly let me say that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year and it is EXTREMELY hard for me to keep my bipolar rage in check with MIL when I spend 6 to 8 hours cleaning up the house and she wrecks it 2 days later.  The kitchen is the real room of anger for me.  MIL has 2 dogs, that NEVER go outside and shit and piss in a room directly off the kitchen.  One of the dogs is 10 the other one is 3.  They never go for walks they aren't housebroken and the icing on the cake for me is that I have a super strong sense of smell so all I can smell when I'm downstairs is dog urine and feces.  So imagine trying to prepare your dinner after spending 8 hours cleaning only to constantly smell piss and that has been my life for the last 3 years. I snapped this morning when I spent 4 hours getting the kitchen to a decently clean level by putting all her stuff in the basement that she doesn't use.  She got up and said I wish I was dead because we put her fryer in a cabinet and put the cord in a drawer.I need help.  I can't live like this anymore.  I am the only person in the house who gives a shit what it looks like ever and it's fucking driving me insane literally.  I committed myself to a mental hospital this year because I couldn't stand my life anymore and found out that I'm bipolar.She never does dishes.  They sit in the sink for MONTHS at a time and then she blames it on my wife.  I'm.done I need like ultimatum material or help because I'm gonna kill her soon(not really but it's what I feel like)Please help [info] None [info] 1481238034
Bloof_Iron [info] Do episodes stop with medication? I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 since August and I'm on my first mood stabilizer, lamictal, up to 300 mg. I feel much more stable than ever before. But my psychiatrist said the goal of mood stabilizers is to dampen or reduce the intensity and effects of episodes. Does that mean that the episodes never go away, they are just milder?

26pages [info] Horrible side affects with lamictol So I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in the beginning of 2017, and pretty quickly started lamictol (I had been on sertraline multiple times before that and it only made things worse). When I first started lamictol, I felt so good, it’s like I knew how it felt to be normal for the first time in my life. Somehow living was actually easy which it had never been before. After a few months my doctor wanted to up the dosage which I was hesitant to do because I felt pretty great but I shrugged off my doubt because doctor knows best right? Well it’s like like things changed for me overnight. I was suddenly experiencing such severe paranoia - which I have never had in my life - to the point where I thought people were out to kill me. I was crying all the time even in front of coworkers which was incredibly embarrassing. I couldn’t think straight or interact normally, it was hard for me to string enough words together to create a coherent thought. All of a sudden I was beyond suicidal. I had a plan, one that I put a lot of thought and effort into. The scariest part was that after feeling depressed/suicidal since I was 12, I had never reached such a serious decision before. Anyway I finally got help and spent a week in the psych ward where they put me back on sertraline. I read so many people absolutely loving lamictol and it being such a game changer that I want to give it another shot. Almost two years ago I don’t feel like I knew very much about bipolar and I don’t feel like any of my healthcare providers really took the time to explain things to me or really get into the depth of things in order to know what I need. My question is: through all the people that love lamictol, is there anyone out there specifically with bipolar 2 that had such extreme reactions to it like me? What works in its place? Also, do you guys think that maybe I just had it increased too fast? I’d really really appreciate any and all feedback. I feel very confused and very mentally and emotionally tired having to continuously figure this all out on my own without any improvement for years now. [info] None [info] 1542689536
cantinflaughs [info] [ADVICE] Destroyed marriage while manic, now may have to live together during separation. Good or bad idea? I was diagnosed with bipolar last year and I've since had two really bad unmedicated manic episodes, where I was very untrustworthy and destructive to my marriage. I spent a lot of money that wasn't mine, and subsequently had sex with someone for money to make the money back. It's awful I know and I am beyond ashamed, I feel guilty and devastated.When I "came to" and realized what I had done I almost threw up. My husband of ten years left me, and told me he needed time away from me. It's been a little over 4 months now and we just started being friendly again. Texting and chatting, we've started couples counseling and he's asked for 6 months to heal and decide what he can and can't forgive. I feel so terrible I'm just grateful for any  chance and any timeline. I've demonstrated a commitment to change by going to  therapy twice a week for the past 3.5 months and have fully immersed myself in learning everything about bipolar, keep a journal and a mood diary, take my medication religiously, started seeing a new psychiatrist who is taking me off SSRIs bc they make me manic and putting me on lithium. I also developed a wellness contract with my therapist that outlines what I need to do to be well like exercise, track my moods, and what I need to avoid, like heavy drinking. Ive also identified my triggers and my delusional thinking (I was raped and when I was manic I thought that I had to take advantage of my super power to disengage during sex to make money-Im not justifying it, I get its problematic but thats what I thought) and identified emergency plans for what happens if I exhibit certain behaviors. In other words, Im doing everything I possibly can to battle my disease and make sure I never go off the deep end again, and manage my illness and be my own caretaker.Before this all happened, we were living in a 2 bedroom with my sister but when the shit hit the fan I moved out to my moms and continued to pay rent. Now, my sister wants to move back home bc her boyfriend has stage 4 cancer and she wants to be closer to him and have my moms support at home. My husband and I understand and are now trying to decide how to navigate what comes next.One option is I move in and take the spare room, which, best case scenario slowly and naturally brings us closer together, or, alternatively, worst case scenario, rushes a delicate process and results in anger and resentment because its too much too soon. Hes reluctant to live together but not unwilling, I just want to be sensitive to his boundaries and make sure Im not interrupting his healing process. Then again, maybe this isnt a terrible idea as long as I treat him like a roommate and stay out of his way and maybe this is fate?? I dk, which is why Im here. I love him so much and our relationship was really good before I became bipolar, and Im really sad and feel really guilty for all the pain and suffering Ive caused. I want to do the right thing and do it the right way. Help!&amp;#x200B;TLDR; Husband of ten years and I separated after I slept with someone for money while manic, its been 4 months and circumstances are pushing us to live together again but in different rooms. Not sure if I should do it or not and if I do if theres a right way to proceed. Want to do the right thing for him and for the relationship. [info] None [info] 1544485129
shinygreenbean [info] No, severe endometriosis + adenomyosis + chronic salpingitis, also I had a problem with scar tissue and adhesions from previous surgeries. Yes I can still have sex, it's no different at all apart from the absence of awful pain now. Life without a uterus is difficult- you go through a kind of grieving process for your fertility and I admit I found that really hard, I hadn't had children yet and I would love to make it unhappen but I can't. You find yourself missing having periods too and crying at tampax adverts. It was difficult too because of my age, I was 31 when I had the op and pretty much all my peers are getting pregnant and posting scan and baby pics on Facebook and talking about their babies, which I had to go and see when they had them and that was really hard. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a while back and my psychiatrist said the trauma of my hysterectomy, including how it happened which was basically an emergency because I was in so much pain every day and also my uterus and right fallopian tube were really distended with blood which had nowhere to go because my cervix was completely closed by a load of scar tissue, was probably a trigger for that. I certainly feel I went mentally downhill after it. As far as BRCA goes I have no idea whether I have that or not. I wouldn't discourage someone from undergoing a hyst for this reason but I would certainly advise them to seek counselling before and after. It would have made so much difference to me if I'd had time to get used to the idea beforehand, I tried but I only had a few days and I wouldn't have had them if I hadn't begged my gynecologist to delay the surgery date to allow me time to get my head round it, which turned out to be pointless because all that happened was a few more days of excrutiating pain and I couldn't think clearly because of it, because I couldn't sleep through it despite the morphine patch I was using by that point which also made it difficult to think clearly. It's got to be one of the most emotionally challenging surgeries there is because your identity and life plans are so caught up with having a functioning uterus. I was going to finish my degree and then we were going to try for children but that never happened, obviously, and 3 years on from the procedure I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life. So yeah, I wouldn't dissuade someone but I would ask them to make sure they're aware of how difficult it really is. [info] None [info] 1370081460
fortunatevoice [info] At 18 I was diagnosed with bipolar and I finally was diagnosed with bpd this year almost 8 years later. [info] None [info] 1531889194
i_have_a_semicolon [info] That's an interesting take on BPD, I must say I don't think "changing identities" is the only criterion. Bpd, like most metal disorder, is categorized by many different symptoms and in order to be diagnosed you must show a minimum of 5 or something like that. So even if you are not trying on different identities like clothes, you can still have BPD.Another thing is that although only ~1% of the pop are diagnosed, its possible the actual figure is somewhere around ~7%I have been researching this lately, because I was diagnosed with bipolar II many years ago, taking medication, and it's mostly "in remission", but despite this I still have emotional reactions that are not proportional to the stimuli. Someone on RP suggested I may have BPD, and after some reading I found bipolar and BPD can be comorbid. This new information has shown me there's still more i can do to "fix" myself - and thus I will be working harder on getting this under control. It's great that people like you are educating others - often times, even psychiatrist won't mention this. I hadn't heard about BPD until RP mentioned it - and after I did my own research I may bring my new self diagnosis back to my therapist/psych, and see if I could start doing CBT [info] None [info] 1480781260
biggmissy420 [info] the story of monkey and bunny Not many can say there one that got away returned to them twice. We originally got together in 2008 I liked the wing man monkey better then the guy asking me out i made the right choice. At that time I was diagnosed with bipolar and broke up with him to this day im not sure why. In 2013 he got ahold of me on the dating site Meetme on my birthday. we both walked to the lake in the middle of town and met up talked for a bit. the next day he brought over some wine coolers and asked me out again. I said yes but trying to get ahold of him the next week was imposible. I figured he ghosted on me. That was Feb I had forgotten about him by the time my brother got arrested in Aug. Sept I got a call from my bro asking if he could give an ex my address i said sure I like getting mail. Two weeks later I realized it was monkey, who was telling me he got arrested two days after we got back together. He had similar charges to my brother and they got the same amount of time locked up. We'd write letters I went to visit him 3 times. The first time he was in lock down for getting in a scuffle. That visit was through glass talking on the phone. The other two time he couldn't get visitors cuz he was in the hospital with teeth problems. In 2015 I had a lot of personal issues with my mom leaving state and knowing who I was as an individual. I knew I loved monkey but I needed someone I could hug Also trying to explain I have a boyfriend but we never hang out. I ended up writing him a Dear John letter.I missed getting letters for a bit, but I went on with my life got my hs diploma,got the correct diagnosis as DID.

plato234 [info] How did you deal with your diagnosis? I see a lot of posts on here along the lines of..."I was diagnosed with bipolar (insert anywhere from yesterday, to more vague "recently") after suffering because of it for a long time. "It's mind blowing to me because a lot of the posts, people accept their diagnosis right away. It took a couple of years before I accepted my diagnosis and thought I had a mental illness. I lost a lot because of that, but I now have a much deeper understanding of my own mind thanks to it. Any others here that fought their diagnosis for a long time and refused treatment? Or, if you were recently diagnosed and accepted it, what makes you accept it so readily? Do you realize you have a chronic illness that has claimed many lives and left destruction in its wake? And if you're young and thinking about the military, forget about it. Something I myself regret. I don't know, I can't stress enough how much of a shock it was to accept I have bipolar.

BigolKitties [info] I have been diagnosed with bipolar and BPD. Bipolar doesnt feel right to me but my therapist and psychiatrist say that's what it is but I don't agree. BPD feel more concrete. [info] None [info] 1559878529
72690 [info] Personally I've taken Prozac, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, Abilify, Seroquel, Risperdol, Lamictal, Trileptal, Thorazine, Trazodone, Gabapentin, and Celexa in my life, at different times/combinations, since 2001. I was diagnosed with bipolar II, OCD, panic disorder, and PTSD. Also borderline personality disorder. I am off of my medication now. I also exercise 3-5x week with cardio, I spend time in nature throughout the week, I supplement and take vitamins, and take 1 teaspoon of Kratom 1-2x a day (8:30 am and 5:30 pm)I find that I am able to go without Klonopin, although I will take a .5mg if I truly need it. This is down from taking it daily or every other day. My prescription medications never worked for me, ever. I would go on and off of them all the time, but everyone around me believed in the pills so much I felt like I owed it to them. Thorazine helped me a lot, but it made me exhausted and has some serious potential side effects. I feel great. I am still figuring out which days are going to be my off days, but overall this is the most relief I've ever had in my entire life. I'm 26 years old. [info] None [info] 1500477679
davos_mith [info] life comes at you fast So I am currently a 3rd-year college student and will be in college for another 2 because of failed classes. So I am at the point in my life where I am not sure which road I want to take. A part of me wants to drop out, get a alright job and travel because college doesn’t make me happy and never has. A 9-5 sounds awful and I don’t really have many interests except music and would like to be creative, but i’ve never tapped into that side of myself. But on the other hand I feel as though I should finish my degree since I’m almost done but on the other hand, I am poor. I already owe the government about 15k for student loans and that number just increase exponentially before I graduate. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I just feel like i’m in a bad place in life. Hindering my chances of living care free with a good job and free lifestyle. I grew up in poverty and I never want to go back to that, you know? Not being to provide the bet for myself or the people I love. I would feel like the biggest ducking failure. I wish I had this epiphany as a senior in high school. Do any of you guys have advice? Maybe on ways to find a passion? I’ve never really had much of a identity since I was born [info] None [info] 1532165768

Candid_Pomegranate [info] I kind of had a similar experience/dilemma...When I met my current boyfriend, I had **a lot** of personal issues I was dealing with, as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder less than two years prior. He knew about it before we began dating, but I don't think he truly understood just how bad it could be. I definitely hurt him through my own self-destructive behaviours, and tried to push him away for his own sake because I just thought he deserved way more than dealing with me but... he loved me. Somehow, he stuck by me through my worst and helped me with the baggage that I had been carrying on my own. So in my case, it took someone else to love me so much to learn how to love and accept myself. I guess I also got really lucky in finding someone whom accepted me despite my flaws.So it's all up to you. Therapy definitely helped begin the process, but it my progress took some time... I took a year off after my diagnosis and took advantage of the services provided by my uni. I wish you the best and I hope my own story helped (at least a little)! :) [info] None [info] 1565296473
ACoN12217 [info] Oh my God. I thought I was the only one.I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 9 or so (my parents constantly reminded me that they paid an expert, who literally wrote the book on bipolar children, $1000 to diagnose me) and was on about 1500 mg of anti-psych and anti-depressants from the time I was 8 till I was about 25. I am also adopted, and the only one on the family who was abused in this way. By calling me crazy and telling me I was lucky my parents kept me with my supposed condition, it kept me subservient to them and worshipping my family for doing me such a charity and "accepting" me.I went off the pills cold turkey about a year and a half ago, and my parents did not approve. The therapist and psychiatric nurse I was seeing though, did approve and tell me there is absolutely nothing wrong with me mentally other than panic disorder I developed from the trauma.It really bothers me that the doctor my parents took me to (as well as the therapist I saw from age 7-14) went along with this and kept perscribing me more pills.  My parents believe the doctors I see must just be going along with my story because they feel bad for me or some such, and my whole family truly believes I still have bipolar and need to be on a sedating level of medications for the rest of my life. It is the biggest impetus I had to go NC.I have recently gone no contact and began exploring and trying to accept the fact that this was abuse. The kicker is that this was only the tip of the iceberg, and there was also physical and verbal abuse beyond the medical stuff. While I don't wish harm on anyone, there is some comfort in knowing I wasn't alone. [info] None [info] 1535809240
jowe11eleven [info] I served for only 2 years. I was sexually assaulted by a sergeant while I was a PFC. Later on k went through a divorce.

Bio_is_life [info] Maintaining Relationships Question Hey there,I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 around two years ago and have been on meds since then. Although I've made pretty significant progress since then, I still do have rare episodes and I'm working on that with my psychiatrist and therapist.However, no matter what I do, I still have a hard time holding onto any long term, significant relationships with people.  I have great friendships (I guess...?) but I never tell those people about my disorder or talk about my feelings with them (bad, I know).  But anyone who I am open with and try and talk to always ends up leaving. For example, I'm usually a very laid back person who loves talking but when I go into a swing I just shut off and isolate myself. I feel empty and alone and just hate myself and everything about the world and I want someone to care about me but then when people do try to help I end up lashing out at them because they don't really understand (stupid, I know). Then when I come out of it I open up more and apologize and I feel really bad about it because I was genuinely mean to them but it just happens over and over and I think I end up hurting  them so much that they just get tired of dealing with it.  Most of my family doesn't talk to me anymore, my girlfriend of five years left me, and I only have one friend left who knows about my disorder but I never talk to him about it. Is it because I'm just a bad person, even without considering bipolar, or is there something else I can do? I don't know if any of you all have experienced something similar and if you want more details or anything I can add more but I just wanted to know if you all had any suggestions. I'm tired of feeling empty and alone and I'd like to feel safe sharing my feelings with someone without them leaving. Sorry if this is dumb or doesn't make sense or is the wrong place to put this...Edit: thank you all so much for taking the time to respond to me, it really means a lot &lt;3 [info] None [info] 1482971971

youRheaDiSoNfirE [info] My (32F) husband (34M), who has a severely enmeshed relationship with his mother (50F), is pretending we broke up and doesn't care how it is affecting our relationship I am going to try to make this as detailed as possible, because I am so desperate for advice. My husband (34M) and I (32F), when we first began dating 2 years ago, both came clean with each other about the fact that he is a recovering opiate addict who takes methadone daily and that I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 1, for full disclosure) as well as PTSD and an eating disorder (EDNOS, for full disclosure, but pretty much anorexia). We both accepted that about one another, and we fell madly in love. At the time, I was living in a town 90 min away and he lived in my hometown, but we saw each other as much as possible. After about 3 months of dating, and about a month after he asked me to marry him, I made a pretty sudden decision to move back to my hometown and live with him. He was living with his mother (50F) and sister (23F) for financial reasons, as his previous wife had absolutely destroyed his life. He helped, of course, but she was truly an awful human being who stole his identity for drug money, amongst other things. She had a son, who my husband had essentially helped raise, and he wanted badly to make it work for the little boy. It didn't, and he eventually moved back in with his mother to rebuild. I should mention here that he grew up without a father, because his mother was 15 when she had him and made the unilateral decision to leave the father off the birth certificate. She used her son as a source of emotional support throughout his entire life, and when he reached his teen years and then especially adulthood, she also began to lean on him as a surrogate spouse. My husband informed me when we started dating that he was extremely close to his mother and any woman who took issue with that probably wasn't the right woman for him. I naively ignored all the signs of severe enmeshment and just took it as a sign that he treats women well. Before I moved in, his mother had been so kind to me. She had a Bernie sticker on her bumper, shared my love of Prince, and clearly loves her son. I really thought "she's so awesome, she really would make a great mother in law". I wanted so badly to be with him and get rid of the distance, and his mother welcomed me into the fold with seemingly open arms. I had only been in the house once prior, and I guess probably must have had some Rose colored goggles on, because when I moved in I realized that the house was filthy. His mother, his sister, and her 4-year-old son seem to be happy with living in total filth, and they also horde animals and neglect them severely. 3 dogs kept in back "rooms" no bigger than closets, rarely taken outside and often going unfed. 5 cats, indoor and outdoor, whose food is poured onto the kitchen counter and onto the floor in piles. His sister, when doing dishes, would just throw entire pots and utensils away rather than washing them, including things I had bought to cook with. Then there was the constant screaming at each other - including at the child. He was genuinely being neglected and screamed at every single morning, had never been to a pediatrician appointment or had a single vaccine, was regularly given baby bottles full of soda, and was pumped full of so much sugar (cupcakes, candy, ice cream, you name it) nightly (well, if you consider 1am night time) that he was literally showing signs of malnutrition. He had also never been to the dentist, which I was told but didn't need to be, because anybody could see that his little teeth were black and decayed around the gums. Obviously, any sane person would be pretty uncomfortable living in those conditions. I don't know how sane I am, but I certainly was. However, I knew it was temporary. We were both working, so we would be out shortly. That's what I thought, anyway. I figured out pretty quickly that my husband's mother has a lot of issues, including money management, and that his sister, despite being 23 years old and having a child, would likely never get a job. She doesn't even have a drivers license. Claims to be an agoraphobe to excuse her behavior but loves to go out to eat and go tanning. Anyway. The dysfunction was THICK. Pretty much weekly, his mother was asking for money, on top of what we were paying her for rent. We could literally never get our footing or save enough to leave, because of pumping so much of our resources into his mom and sister, including often picking up cigarettes for his sister and never getting reimbursed.Compounded with this money situation, which his mother was clearly ashamed of, is the fact that I was witnessing all of this awful behavior and the neglect and emotional abuse going on, which she was also clearly ashamed of. I kept in our room pretty much always, because I was very uncomfortable with how dirty the house was, and seeing the neglected animals just became too much. My husband's mother and sister began to think of me as snobby, and his mother's behavior simultaneously started to get WEIRD. She would text him literally anytime we left the house to ask where we were going, and throw shade if we were doing something fun together or going to dinner. Anything, really. I began to notice that our things were being rifled through, daily it seemed, including very private things like our sex toys. His mother would take and use whatever she wanted of mine, sometimes putting it back but usually just leaving it lying out for me to grab and put back. Any semblence of boundaries that may have existed before were completely gone. She began to pick fights with my husband, and the closer our wedding date got, the more unhinged she became, culminating in her point blank asking him not to marry me, and even going as far as insinuating to other family members that they should not support our marriage.When that didn't work, shit really hit the fan. When my husband told her that he was going to need the several hundred dollars she had borrowed so we could pay for our wedding, she began screaming at him and telling him how ungrateful he is. I heard it all and marched out of the bedroom to defend him, but stopped myself in my tracks because I knew he wouldn't want me to. That's when I saw his sister, sitting on the floor, with her iPad. She had the most awful, bone chilling smile on her face as she listened to her family rip each other to shreds. I was seriously shocked by her face, and then I was angry. So I looked her in the eye and said "get a fucking job, _____." And I walked out the front door. All hell broke loose at this point. His mother charged after me and got in my face. We argued, said horrible things to each other. And this is the part that I still can't comprehend - why they would do it and why she would tell on herself. But regardless, she triumphantly informed us that she and his sister had read through ALL of our messages to each other. Which means a ton of sexting and just stuff that any normal mother would never even WANT to see, let alone gleefully brag she had read. So, we left. We moved in with his aunt, where life was much better. His mother and sister did not attend our wedding. And since then, she refers to me as his girlfriend. She continues to demand an emotionally incestuous relationship with my husband, and if he dares to not communicate several times a day with her, she jumps right into accusing him of being a bad son and a terrible stepfather to his FORMER stepson. I am not allowed at family functions, and have been forced to sit outside a restaurant in the car while my husband celebrated with his family.We are still loaning her money anytime she asks. 2 years later and his sister still has no job. A family member finally stepped in and demanded they stop neglecting the little boy's health and development, so thankfully he is now fully caught up on vaccines, has been to the dentist, and is in kindergarten. The house is still filthy, the animals still aren't properly cared for (2 of the dogs died under her watch in the last year,  and I finally called animal control today for the dog they are still neglecting), and like I said nothing has changed about his mom's weird interest in his life. We live in a lovely home I found for us, and life should be better - but so many things haven't changed.My mental health has always taken a backseat during our relationship. My husband's methadone is always a top priority, and over the course of our time together and after being on methadone for YEARS, he is down to 24mg, compared to the 68 he was on when we met. I make his Dr appointments for him, made him go to the dentist which he was deathly afraid of and never would have done had I not made him, probably saving him from a severe infection that could have killed him. His home is furnished, decorated, clean and comfortable, which he says is the first time he's had that since his grandmother when he was a kid. I encouraged him to push forward toward a better job, which he got. But I am often given the backseat. When money is tight, my husband insinuates that because I'm anorexic it's easier for me to go without eating, so food for him is always a priority but not necessarily for me. I asked over and over and over during the course of this year if he could get me some help because I feel suicidal sometimes and because I have no medication. When I moved here, I left my doctors behind. Anytime I said anything, he would say yes I'll get you help but he never followed through. Not once. He goes to his mother when we have issues and tells her everything about me, and also sometimes lies about me to make himself look better. He has used cocaine repeatedly over the last year and lied to me about it. The only time I get the truth is when I discover it on my own.A month ago, I went to New York (13 hours from my home) for a very important family meeting. I used our card for more than I expected, and was unable to communicate quick enough for him, so he started calling my family and talking trash about me. I told him I was leaving him, that it was just too much. So he involved his family and told them insanely huge lies about me. His mother used it as an opportunity to tell him to come stay with her. She absolutely loves when we have issues. When I returned a couple days later, we talked and came to a resolution and stayed together. But I discovered that to save face, he was still telling intricate lies to his family about me. All of this, in addition to the month leading up to it, in which my mental health was absolutely wrecked, put me in a state of rapid cycling. Manic one minute, suicidal the next. Over and over and over. I was miserable, my marriage was essentially Swiss cheese, and my husband was never going to cut the apron strings. I was angry and I was sad and most of all, I was confused. My behavior was erratic, my moods were switching between angry and devastated by the minute. So many things triggered me all at once, and none of them were going away. My husband informed me that I was out of control and needed to check into a psychiatric hospital. I resented him so much, partly because I knew he was right, but mostly because he had ignored my pleas for help for SO LONG that now I needed to go to the psych ward instead of just being able to get better with meds and therapy. I agreed, but my resentment coupled with my rapid cycling turned me into a monster. I said awful, hurtful things. I threw his phone down and broke it, and then......... I did the same thing to his Xbox. There is no excuse for that behavior. My illness explains why I did it, but it doesn't make it okay or acceptable. I am a grown adult and I take full responsibility for doing those things, despite being incredibly ashamed of them. My diagnosis helps provide a road map, or an instruction manual for me if you will, but it never excuses what I do. I am responsible for my behavior, not my illness.After breaking the Xbox, he left. I began to write a suicide note. Midway through this chore, he showed up with one of his aunts, who explained that I would be checking in NOW instead of the next day like we had planned. I got my things together and they drove me to the facility. My husband didn't even come inside with me, which still hurts when I think about it. They just dropped me off and left. I checked myself in and spent the next 3 days getting my meds adjusted, going to group therapy, and getting better. My doctor released me and my husband picked me up. While I was there, the same aunt who drove me pried into my treatment there. Illegally, I might add. She severely violated my rights. She is an RN who used to work there and still has friends who are there. I still am coming to terms with that violation and have to talk myself down from contacting someone and attempting to get her nursing license revoked. I'll get over it eventually, but right now it's still fresh and just a reminder that my in laws fundamentally don't understand the concept of boundaries, and have no intention on ever observing them even if they did understand the concept. In addition to that, his entire family (but especially his mother) let him know that unless he breaks up with me, they are essentially disowning him. So, like a very good son/nephew, he is doing as they demand. Except he isn't. We are still together - he received back a very different wife than the wife he dropped off. I have made a huge effort to change in a tiny amount of time, because he doesn't deserve a rapid cycling nutjob who breaks things. I should point out that that was not a regular thing - I've never done anything like that before that day. But he is lying to his family because he is afraid to not have them to ask for help when he needs to, and also because the enmeshment is so strong. Also, while I was hospitalized, he spent the only money we had on cocaine and had a 3 day binge. I was unable to reach him by phone almost the entire time I was there because he used the money for cocaine instead of the cell phone bill. He began lying to me immediately about it, and has used since I have been back too. He lies about so much now that I literally never know when he is being truthful. I've never done cocaine, my father is a cocaine addict and has been for 35 years, so it scares the ever living fuck out of me, and it scares me so bad to see my own husband struggle with the compulsion to use it.I don't know what to do. I'm afraid we are toxic, but I see what our relationship does for him. I know what will happen if we do break up - he will spiral down into that place of addiction, he will eventually move back in with his mother, and his life will return to what it was before he met me. I love him so much - there is so much wonderful in him. He is kind and thoughtful and loving. But he has this other side, this selfish "every man for himself" part. And his enmeshed relationship with his mother is now stronger than ever. She's clearly thrilled, and it makes me feel sometimes like there is "another woman" in our marriage, and then I feel ridiculous for thinking that. But I can't help it. I also can't help seeing that our relationship as it is now is keeping me from getting healthy. I left the hospital with resolve, with a new outlook on life, with a will to not just live but to live WELL. And I can feel all of that progress crumbling. He won't be honest with me, or his family. I can't even celebrate our wedding anniversary because I'm supposed to be keeping us a secret. He even has ME helping to hide myself from his family. He's gone so far now that they think I'm gone and so are my things. It's such an intricate web of deceit and it breaks my heart, because it's all in the name of convincing a large group of people that I'm an awful human being and that he's "finally rid of her".I. Dont. Know. What. To. Do.Someone please help me. Tell me it's useless, or tell me how I can get him to work on being healthy with me. We argued last night because he wanted to get cocaine, and he loaned his mother money again today. How do I fix this? I'm desperate to fix it, because I love him and I know that he loves me. I just don't know how. Tl;Dr - I'm worried that my husband and I can't function in a healthy way together, and that his family's refusal to observe boundaries, plus his emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother, will likely to be the final few nails in the coffin.

getinthetardis [info] My best friend is slowing starting to stop talking to me. It is really hard to go through. We used to talk for hours every day the past few years now she claims to be too busy to even say text a hi. A few things have led to it. She got a new girlfriend and has pushed me away since. I don't know if there is a lesbian version of "chicks before dicks/bros before hoes" but she is definitely not following it. I've tried talking to her about it but it goes no where. I can't make plans with for even a week in advance because she has to know what her girlfriend wants to do first. Then if she does make plans for me they usually get put on hold aalllll day then it's "Oh, i'm going out to dinner last minute chance. i'll text you when i'm done." then nothing. Don't hear from her at all. The cherry on top is I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few weeks ago and have been having a hard time dealing with it. all I really want is my best friend back so I have someone to talk to. But like I said, even texting "hi" is too much apparently. :/ [info] None [info] 1333926406

a_bi_polarbear [info] Does this religion contribute towards mental health problems? (Also hello) Hello, I have been a lurker for about 6 months now (on a different account that I no longer use) so I decided it was about time that I said hello.I am from Western Australia and I'm 26years old. I was raised in the "truth", baptized at 13, started fading at 15-16, then was DF'ed at 19. Since then my life has been up and down (mostly down.) My question for my fellow ex-jws is, do you think that the emotional abuse we suffer from shunning has a part in developing metal health issues? I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 a couple of years ago, with very strong depressive phases, resulting in being hospitalized several times, including spending time in a mental ward (it is a horrid place to end up.) It is still an on-going struggle, but reading about others experiences here and just knowing I'm not alone in a lot of my feelings toward jws has helped immensely. So I also wanted to say thanks. :) [info] None [info] 1395954229
AtlantisAngel98 [info] I do agree with you about the hormone thing.. and I know everyone is different and you do have an absolutely valid point but I'm going to share my experience.  I was diagnosed with bipolar at 15. I was told since I was 12 that it was just hormones and that I would grow out of it. So I tried vitamin therapy and birth control pills to try to come to a solution, and when none of those worked, I knew it was time to try something else. I had been severely suicidal and was just waiting for an oppurtunity or off myself.. and I started getting manic, having delusions, ect. It snowballed into me blacking out and causing physical harm to a few people around me, and I wouldn't know what happened except for what I have been told, and "coming out of it" being held down by a few people.Again, I agree with your hormone suggestion, as that is the case for people too, but the patient knows their body the best and knows when something just isnt right. I WISH it was hormones in my situation, maybe it could have prevented some damage.To the OP:Maybe you can try to get a friend to drive, or another trusted family member. Where I live, there is medical transportation services that can take people to and from appointments and I believe its covered by health insurance (depends of course).  If these symptoms are interfering with your life, or you feel suicidal, you should get help as soon as possible.  I would just hate to see you suffer any more than you have to. I also think that you should give your parents more credit. Its hard. Maybe when you talk to them about it, print out those quizzes and maybe some information on Bipolar disorder so they can get a better understanding. It took my mom years to understand.  Its possible that they might be a little freaked out at first, because a lot of people don't know what the illness actually entails, but inform them with as much information on the subject that you can. I'm not a parent, but I think that its hard for any parent to come to terms with the fact that their child isn't 100% "healthy" because they don't want any harm to come to their children. But its not the end of the world if that is your diagnosis. I'm sure your parents would rather know than not know, parents want to be involved in your life, and they will prolly appreciate you coming to them and give you love and support in the long run.  Good Luck! [info] None [info] 1294013698
MKflipflops [info] Any advice for diagnosis process I've been diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychosis as well as other physical and mental issues (comorbidities are evil). Since I've been getting way less stable I've been paying more attention to my mental health, talking to more people, just in general doing what I can to help myself. After talking to people in a bipolar group and reading more about it, plus hearing about schizoaffective for the first time and researching it, I realized it is likely that and not bipolar. My two bipolar diagnoses were really fast and based only on the fact that I was manic and have been suicidal. My latest psych team wasn't sure. I know schizo- something has been brought up by my doctors in the past but I honestly blocked out the rest of the conversation and I think I probably threw a fit. All that is to say that I'm not coming from nowhere. I know that I more classically fit schizoaffective than bipolar. I am going to a new, hopefully more organized psych practice and hope to talk to whoever my new doctor ends up being about it.  But my question is, how were you diagnosed? Did anyone get diagnosed by bringing it up themselves? I don't want to diagnose myself. I want to talk to a doctor about it but, especially due to medical trauma, I really don't want to be dismissed.

xviriditasx [info] Antipsychotics can help a lot, but if your psychosis is caused by a mood episode, as it is with a lot of people with bipolar disorder, treating the mood episode will alleviate symptoms of psychosis. This can include medications like mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and some various meds prescribed off label. I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder before later being diagnosed as schizoaffective bipolar type. I struggled to find a therapist who understood psychosis well and could actually help me. I had to learn how to be my own therapist, teaching myself how to do reality checks and manage psychotic symptoms. I’ve set some hard rules for myself - for example, any time I hear a disembodied voice, I remind myself that it is my own thoughts that I am perceiving inaccurately. Under no circumstances will a disembodied voice actually talk to me. It’s all me.  [info] None [info] 1521565547
Em42 [info] I have absence seizures (I know nothing like those of you with really serious, disruptive forms of epilepsy) and bipolar disorder.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago, I'm 33, I've probably taken around 100 different medications in countless combinations, so I know meds suck, they don't work as advertised, the side effects are hell, drug regiments are complex and difficult to follow, I'm taking 7 different drugs right now at 4 different times a day.  One drug I've been on for a few years is Lamictal and it actually makes me less depressed (and with Topamax no more absence seizures yay), I don't know if it would have that effect if I weren't also bipolar, but it might.  It does dumb me down some (not as much as Topamax, honestly they should have just named that one Stupamax) but that effect has dissipated over time and isn't as bad now (plus I'm lucky I won the genetic lottery and have the IQ points to spare which helps some but I still fucking hate it).  Maybe they could try changing things up or adding something with some mood stabilizing properties to the therapy you're already on.  It's worth taking to your doctor about.Since I'm also bipolar I've had many suicidal thoughts over the years so I can really relate to how you must be feeling.  They come in a few forms, the "I just don't want to go on living" kind, which are the least serious but still very upsetting, the "I want to kill myself" kind (but have no plan), which is a little worse and really hard to cope with, and the "I'm going to kill myself and I know how and I know when" that last one, if you're having that, go to an ER and tell them you want to die and you have a plan.  You're a danger to yourself and you need help.  The first two fall under what's known as "suicidal ideation" the last one does not, it's the serious kind, when you start planning you really need help.  I hope you feel better soon, life isn't all shit, even when it seems like it is.  There are a lot of good things out there even if they aren't what you originally set out to do, I was pre-med before I became too sick to finish my schooling, being a doctor was all I ever wanted to do.  In some ways it became a trap and I've never been able to move on because that was the only plan I had.  I worked a lot of bullshit jobs since then.  I had a baby, unfortunately not with a nice guy (he beat me), but my son (11 now) while he has some issues (high functioning autism, ADHD) is really smart and kind and funny, I probably wouldn't have made it all these years without him.  I'm trying to get disability since I haven't been able to work since 2013, I figure if I do then I'll take a painting class or a bonsai class at the local botanical garden or something, get myself out of the house a couple days a week.  There are positive experiences that you're are still capable of having even if they aren't the super driven ideals you had in mind for your life.  You can still contribute to things in a positive way, there's always a need for people to do charity work and that's something you could do a bit of to keep busy while you job hunt.  I've done some work at shelters for victims of domestic violence (it was a good fit since I was a victim at one point in my life) and I found it to be really rewarding, I never left there feeling bad about myself, I always left feeling like I had done something meaningful, something good, it always made me feel better knowing I had made even a small difference in someone's life.What you're feeling now, it's not forever.  Things will look up again, maybe not how you expect, but they will, I promise.  I know it's cliche, but it's true, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  Every single person that has ever jumped off the golden gate bridge and lived says pretty much the same thing, to paraphrase "about half way down I realized all my problems were fixable except that I was falling to my death."  You will make it through this, you've gotten this far, I can tell from what you wrote that you're a strong person, forget about throwing in the towel and just focus on the little things that make life just a little better.  It's just like I tell my son everyday **"what are we going to do?"**  **"We're going to try to make today just a little bit better than yesterday"** you're not looking for a miracle, it's about **Progress Not Perfection**.

funbun69 [info] Mental hospitals Hey guys ! So I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 when I 17. (Currently 21) But through the ages of 14-16 I was constantly being sent to the hospital because my frequent mood changes!!! Nobody new if I was depressed or happy. Just because I was in and out of the hospital every other month for an entire year , I believe I was in the hospital roughly 6 times out of the year; each visit  lasting about two weeks . Anyways ! That being said in the city I was currently living in , there as no hospitals for adolescents! So they’d drive me to different city’s in my state (: So my question is ?What hospitals did you guys go to? How was your experience? Did you like the food (lol)? How old were you?  How cold was it (lol)? Did you enjoy walking in socks (lol)?What were the hospitals names ?  Just please tell me your experiences ! I always wanted to know other thoughts !!( sorry if my spelling is off , I am foreign ) [info] None [info] 1529140265
littlekarp [info] Mania and alcohol? Hey y’all,I was just diagnosed with bipolar 1 about a week ago but I haven’t started any meds yet (waiting a week till my insurance does its thing). I’ve been feeling manic the last few days (haven’t slept, doing all the things all the time, SO many good ideas, ya know) so tonight I decided to get drunk to calm myself down/hopefully sleep. I’m very tiny (like 110 lbs) and I’ve had 7 shots but I don’t feel anything at all! Normally I’d be passed out drunk by now but I still feel sober/wide awake/ ready to do even more things! Anyway, I’m wondering if this is a mania thing? I’m still so new to this I don’t really know what’s going on. I haven’t eaten at all today so it’s extra weird that I don’t feel drunk, but it feels good and I’m having fun so at least there’s that! [info] None [info] 1582342328

It still sets me back hundreds of dollars a month to buy my fucking antipsychotics. I'm used to the apologetic and stunned looks from the pharmacist when I go to pay.I also had an awful experience at the psych ward at Jubilee.

starflashfairy [info] I have been hospitalized three times. The first time I was fourteen. I was cutting myself because I was super depressed. They put me on Prozac, which was a terrible mistake...The second time I was trying to kill myself after a very traumatic event. I was on Topamax for headaches and I had just gotten a new refill. I was on an extremely high dose twice a day, so there were 60 pills in the bottle at 200 mg each. I swallowed the whole bottle and went to lie down and sleep myself to death. My dad found the bottle empty on the counter and came up and called an ambulance. I wound up in the ICU. They couldn't pump my stomach without killing me, so they put me on a saline drip and then took me to the psych ward. There I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. They started regulating my meds, though I went through a few very manic years.The third time, I was only considering suicide, but my new therapist at the time decided to 302 me for safety due to my history. I went to the hospital and was given a second diagnosis, borderline personality disorder, which when paired with bipolar disorder is extremely difficult to manage. They've finally got me slightly stabilized on the correct meds now though, because of this diagnosis.Each time I went, I stayed for a week, and each time the experiences were not fun, but overall it's helped in ways I never expected. But I want to avoid ever going back.   [info] None [info] 1487484013

loliclown [info] Absolutely. In psychiatry, these are called "crying spells". I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder when I was 21 years old, and one of my bewildering symptoms were crying spells. It made so much sense when my psychiatrist told me about them. Just about anyone can experience them, especially during times of stress, feeling overwhelmed, or even exhaustion, especially mental and emotional exhaustion. They just happen more often for bipolar people like me, or depressed or anxious people. You're completely normal, and crying is actually good for your body and mental health. If you need to cry, let yourself cry. You'll feel a bit better afterwards. [info] None [info] 1528286268

I was first taken to the ER and checked into a psych ward in 2005.  At that time, they said that I was must likely OCD, although, I'm not sure where this came from.My first post hospital pdoc said that he believe that I suffered from borderline personality disorder, and I agreed 100% with this diagnosis.  Since then, I've seen so many pdocs both inpatient and out.  In 2007, I was told I had been diagnosed bipolar, but no one seemed to know by which doctor.I have my fair share of ups and downs, but I don't think I have ever had anything that would be considered mania.  Definitely impulsive at times, but that falls into the BPD.  The more I think about it, and read about it, and think about it, the more I think I'm not actually bipolar.The problem is that I don't get along with my pdoc that well, and I'm not sure that I can bring this up with my pdoc without becoming confrontational.

dykexdaddy [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when it was actually post-traumatic stress from my hilariously shitty childhood. Also, I was 15, and a gay biracial kid living in a backwoods shithole, of fucking course I was depressed and angry and got into a lot of fights. I spent at least a year on 4 or 5 different mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, etc. at the same time. I remember basically nothing about it. I lucked out in that we had shitty insurance so my parents took me off the meds when they got too expensive.I was still like 30 before I actually got a working diagnosis.

edmdusty [info] This sounds like me. I was a binge drinker like this.  I was using booze as a coping mechanism to quash negative emotional states. Used a.a. to quit drinking. Some people say that addiction has to be actual physical dependency. Others say it's wanting to quit and can't. I think binge drinkers are not physically dependent but emotionally dependent. If it's causing trouble in your life then it's probably time to think about quitting. A couple years after I quit, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Now that I'm managing that and using healthy coping skill I don't need a.a. to stay sober. It would be worth checking out a meeting with an open mind. Also go see a shrink. Getting sober and diagnosed hasanged my life from choas to something i can manage.  [info] None [info] 1486394083
divermom74 [info] This is my Face Book coming-out post from March 10.“Here goes, humor me and hang in till the end…A few months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The decision to share has been tough, scary. Blythewood is a small town with a BIG baseball park. But a couple years ago, I posted about how desperately our country needs to take mental illness seriously. So here I am shaking, heart pounding, fighting tears, so afraid of the stigma yet driven by that stigma. People post on FB all the time about their diagnoses to ask for prayers, raise awareness, vent, tell their stories (or those of family members), celebrate. Cancer, Alzheimer’s, autoimmune disorders, lupus, MS, epilepsy, diabetes, major surgeries, treatments, successes, resignation, acceptance. Now it’s my turn. Toward the end of the summer, I began to suspect that something wasn’t right, so Davis and I talked with my doctor. Fast forward through many appts, a complete psych eval, and BAM I have bipolar 1 disorder. It's pretty scary to learn that you have an illness that’s life-altering, life-long, life-threatening. One that by society’s standards means you’re crazy. I became super dependent on Davis. I didn’t trust myself. I found myself clinging to him to make me feel safe. My doctor started treatment with meds, making gradual additions and dosage tweaks since then. There’ve been numerous ups and downs and I’ve ruined many things that should have been great fun with friends. But now we know why. I’m in a good place with my meds. I feel like me again. I have the best hubby and friends ever. They’ve seen me at my worst and have never judged me. Instead they protected me, loved me when I was unlovable. I know it’ll rear its ugly head again, but we’ll handle it. I don’t want pity, I don’t want anyone on eggshells around me, afraid they’re going to “set me off.” What I want is awareness and understanding as opposed to fear and labels. So I’ll take this diagnosis as part of me, I’ll educate anyone who’ll listen or read my posts, I’ll be myself because I have a purpose and I remember that now. I’ll take this bipolar thing and run with it.” [info] None [info] 1522440878
laurabethh [info] Manager tells me my physicians note is not valid I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for formatting errors. Also, this is my first time posting here. My apologies if I  say anything I shouldn't. First of all, I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 for eleven years now. As well as a few other pesky mental illnesses. They like to travel in packs I've noticed. I'm sure we know how important sleep is to staying stable. If my sleep patterns change (and the times I take my meds) so do my moods. If they change drastically, I have a fun exciting terrifying manic episode that eventually leaves me so depressed I can't function. I work at a hotel at the front desk. Twice the gm has had me fill in as night auditor. 11pm-7am for several weeks the first time and two weeks the second time. After the second time I had my physicians assistant who prescribes for me at my mental health center to write a note. It basically said due to my mental illness I can't work these hours. GM calls me into her office to tell me that I can't choose my shifts. That my doctor can't choose my shifts. Oh and I can't just opt out because I "don't like the hours". In almost any emotional situation I'm going to cry. Which I did. She said something like it's okay I know you're sensitive. The thing is, I want feeling sad, or hurt, delicate, or sensitive. I was angry. She has no idea what it is like to hold a full time job while juggling a mental illness that feels like a tiny dictator threatening to overthrow you. She told me my note it useless.  I feel like this isn't right. I'm pretty sure that bipolar disorder is protected under ADA. Should I speak to my provider again? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.

beanieweenie [info] Hey OP, you are not alone. I have been in a committed relationship for about 16 years. The first 6 years were long distance, and I cheated on my partner with 3 people during that time (a coworker, a guy who I knew was using me for sex but who I was obsessed with, and also my sister's boyfriend). I 'fessed up to my partner and he was able to forgive me. We ended up moving in together 10 years ago, and during the first two years of living with my partner I found the opportunity to cheat on him yet again with one of my old hookups. My partner is a lovely person, we are totally emotionally and sexually compatible. Basically there was no reason for me to cheat except that I craved the rush and validation of someone (anyone, lol) desiring me. Up until recently, I just thought I was a shitty person. Two months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and found out about hypersexuality and it suddenly made me realize that my infidelity was not because I'm a terrible human being, but because I am ~~I'll~~ ill and sometimes unable to resist the urges and feelings that this disorder lays on me. I still do think that I am somewhat responsible for the choices I made back then, but now I realize all I was up against with dealing with this illness that I didn't know I had. I think maybe if I would have known about my bipolar maybe I would have made different choices. [info] Bipolar 2 [info] 1563908237

ENGALND [info] I want to decrease my dose of quetiapine (seroquel). Semi success story. I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and Asperger's and have been taking quetiapine for roughly 8 years, maybe ten. I am unsure of my bipolar diagnosis and a previous psychiatrist suggested it may be BPD but she left shortly after (she was a good one). Anyway that's for a different thread one day. I started off on 600mg the reduced to 450 and noticed an immediate change in my eating habits, or lack of. I was no longer waking up at X-am and eating all the chocolate or sweet snacks I could find! My weight dropped from 17 and a bit stone to 14 in nine months, though I did have a decent hour+ walk most days and at a pace to make me sweat. After several weeks I then decreased again to 300mg which I have been on for around 4 months. Now I was due an appointment with my psychiatrist and psychologist that was cancelled due to covid, and one of the things I was going to discuss was decreasing the dose further with the intention of coming off them **at some point in the future.** I have 300mg tablets and a set of accurate milligramme scales - if I were to weigh a 300mg tablet, crush it and take the equivalent of 200mg (I know most of the pill is binder) is this safe to do? I'm assuming that the spread of quetiapine in these pills are equal throughout. I'd go down from 300 to 150 but the drop before from 450 to 300 was horrible in terms of side effects. I have a dozen 10mg diazepam in case of restless nights or irritability during the day.What are people's experiences with decreasing the dose and by how much did you do it? Thanks!Small edit: I have noticed no increase in irritability, no decrease in mood or suicidal thoughts apart from the first 10 to 14 days after lowering the dose. After that I'm fine, if anything I feel better on a lower dose. More motivation, I can keep to a regular sleeping pattern (still face some difficulty) and I'm preparing meals from scratch with fresh veg instead of microwave meals. I have also been microdosing mushrooms since the beginning of January which have had a profound effect on my mental well-being. [info] None [info] 1586012664

I have done therapy and am on meds, which keeps me somewhat stable, but it is still excruciatingly hard to deal with. As though having one or the other isn't hard enough to deal with, having both is brutal. I am never truly stable, and constantly wonder which symptoms are caused by which disorder. My life is a series of extremes, my mood is constantly up and down and I never know if it is because my meds aren't working or if it is the borderline mood swings.

frankievanian [info] I’m sorry you have to deal with people like this. It’s difficult to not take anything like that to heart, but rest assured you’re definitely not a burden. Anyone who thinks that you are is ignorant. All people are difficult to deal with sometimes, and you shouldn’t have to feel this way purely because you have a diagnosis. People need to learn how to interact with each other better. Thought I do not know your personal struggle, I often get brushed off when showing any emotion because I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and get the occasional “you’re pretty high functioning for someone who’s bipolar”. It used to upset me but now I understand that people who act that way have no interest in looking at the world from any other perspective than their own. You are not a burden.

heroicdoberman [info] Hello. It seems difficult to find the right person that complements your ideas and personality. Let alone the right psychiatrist! If it seems that he/she is not focusing his/her attention to the point of the matter, then maybe that doctor is not suited for you. Evaluate first if you are comfortable with your doctor, his/her body language, the way he/she listens and answers your thoughts, and the specificity of his/her prescriptions. Allow yourself to ask your doctor questions that make you gauge on his/her answers. Write your questions down. Make a list. For example, ask your doctor how do these meds interact with your system.When I got an episode of mania and psychosis in 2015, My family and I searched all over our city for the right psychiatrist, most of those doctors were unavailable at that time and we were scheduled an appointment during nighttime already after a long day's search.I am diagnosed with bipolar fairly recently. I am relearning the way I focus on things. My concentration decreased as I had to drop out of college due to my condition. I can't seem to do one task for sometime, trying to do tasks so hard but eventually end up failing to finish it. I fell many times, trying to be positive yet dwindling as I lose focus. Today I can assure you that my willpower (though how weak it may seem), along with my meds and talk therapy, fairly increased my focus (a bit). So don't give up!Keep on questioning and keep on looking for the one that fits. Maybe the change could put your mind into a new perspective. [info] None [info] 1515583041

smelalie [info] I need some help So I don't really know where to start; never been good at writing so bear with me. Oh and I'm a 19 year old female,second year of college if that helps.Two weeks ago exactly I tried to kill myself by overdosing (first time ever trying). I knew I was depressed, it had been going on for about 7-8 months, but it got bad during this past fall semester. I was failing all my classes because I could not get out of bed, I was pretty much living by myself because my roommates were never home, I didn't have many friends, and my family situation has never been too good. I wanted to get psychiatric help but I just couldn't get myself motivated to do it. I didn't want to ask family or friends for help because I didn't want to burden them with my problems. So after going to the hospital to get my stomach pumped I was sent to a mental hospital and stayed there from the 16-21 of December. I'm very happy that I was forced to go there because it finally gave me the help I needed. While there I was diagnosed with bipolar II. I always thought I was just depressed. They did not describe very well to me though what exactly bipolar means. They told me about manic episodes though and I do believe I have those where some days the world is just so good. So my first request for help is if anyone has a link or can describe simply to me what it means to be bipolar.My next request for help is advice i guess. After I got out of the hospital I felt really awesome glad to be home and the medications they gave me seamed to be working (zyprexa=mood stabilizer; zoloft=antidepressants). But today I was having the best time since I have been home because my two best girlfriends were over. We stayed up late but the my mother for being awake too late. So I go to try and sleep but I keep getting thoughts of suicide again. I don't like whats going on. I can't get into a psychiatrist until the 18 but I really hate these thoughts and feelings and don't know what to do; I haven't slept at all. Sorry again for the horrible sentence structures and run on sentences. [info] None [info] 1356785204
gaychapstick [info] A lot on my mind... Hi! This is my (21F) first time posting here.I do not have schizophrenia but I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 w/ psychosis. I’ve experienced psychosis since I was 14, and I managed for a very long time on medication. However, I came off my anti-psychotic meds (Geodon) over a year ago because the med starting causing very nasty side effects. I switched to an anti-convulsant (Lamictal) to just manage my bipolar symptoms thinking it would be fine since I had not experienced psychosis since I was 16. I was fine for a while, but started experiencing psychosis again in March of this year. I had a very bad delusional episode in April and was nearly sent to the hospital by my therapist. Since then I really haven’t been managing well. I’ve been having pretty consistent but brief episodes of psychosis since then. I have a reoccurring delusion of being trapped in an alternate reality. Sometimes in these brief episodes I believe everyone around me is conspiring to keep me trapped there. I also become convinced that every time I close my eyes, someone or something is in the room with me, watching me, but vanishes once I open my eyes. (As you can imagine this makes it very hard to sleep, or be in my house by myself) I also have minor hallucinations; brighter colors, shadows in my peripheral vision, and the particularly scary one of a person screaming into my ear: usually only one or two words, but incredibly loud like a gunshot. I’ve also been lucid dreaming a lot lately. Probably just due to the fact I’m constantly asking myself if I’m dreaming, or if what I’m experiencing is real. When I realize I’m dreaming I usually inform the others in my dream that I’m aware I’m sleeping, and that’s when it becomes terrifying. I’ll say something along the lines of, “No, this isn’t real. I’m dreaming!”. Everyone in the dream will then stare at me, go dead silent and blank faced, like you see in movies, before becoming aware with me and saying things along the lines of, “Well, congratulations! You’ve figured it out. You’re still trapped here though. How exactly do you plan of waking yourself up?”  All of that on the table; I’m worried I’m going to have a full psychotic break if I don’t get help soon. I also fear my only option for “help” is medication, and I really don’t favor that. I’ve probably been on a hundred different medications since I was 14 and I’m so sick of it, being a walking trial and error experiment.  I’m also really scared to post this now. I’ve been constantly invalidated by my family my entire life, to the point where I feel like maybe I don’t have this diagnosis after all? Am I just making all of this up? I know my psychosis doesn’t match the typical psychosis symptoms. I also know my friends and boyfriend in particular really struggle to support me. I don’t blame them, because I don’t even know how to deal with this. I guess I’m just hoping to find comfort in this community... A place for me to finally vent to people who will maybe understand what I’m going through right now. I’m sorry in advance if I’m accidentally breaking any community rules. Also, thank you in advance to anyone who even bothered to read this whole post. (As a final side note: I’d love to hear more about how you guys experience these symptoms (types of hallucinations, duration of delusions, etc). It doesn’t seem like there is much useful information online.) [info] None [info] 1536879063
chiefofthesky [info] Well if we're talking definitions, then yes, your lack of interest in sex seems to lean toward asexuality. The most important factor in the asexual definition (meaning all other factors are very individual-specific) is that you aren't *sexually attracted* to anyone. It doesn't mean you don't enjoy sexual pleasure, but it means when (if) you experience sexual desire it isn't a result of a specific person. This isn't taking into account gray asexuality of course. Aversion to/lack of desire for masturbation is another individual-specific factor that might be present, but isn't always. And you don't have to have sex to know you're asexual either. Hope that helps. I can answer other questions too. Edit: I am diagnosed with bipolar II. My libido definitely changes with my cycles, but I still never feel sexual attraction to a *person*. And whether it's due to my medications or what, my usual libido is pretty low. I don't get aroused easily. That's just me though.  [info] None [info] 1439930892
zerza [info] Well if it isn't permanent you should be fine. But I would look closer at those bipolar episodes, and try to keep them to a minimum. The old, push harder when you're down, steady on the break when you're up. I was diagnosed with bipolar before I left school (turned out that it wasn't a correct diagnosis and that it was drugs causing the mania etc) but from my own experiences of mania and deep valleys a lot of things can go wrong where you might trigger something else due to lack of sleep/food etc or thought patterns and suspicions can lead to some delusions etc. &amp;#x200B;Trust your doctor, if he/she says it's temporary then just follow the right path and you should be in the clear. Best of luck [info] None [info] 1534965276
riker89 [info] Incorrect, there are other reasons for failure. For example, I flunked out because I was near-suicidally depressed, self harming, and many days literally did not get out of bed except to eat or pee. A year or so later, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. So it wasn't that I didn't do my best, my best just wasn't enough at the time. Now that I've successfully been in treatment for a few years, I'm looking forward to going back next fall.  [info] None [info] 1443699159

Clarice_Ferguson [info] Bipolar is a major struggle- people just assume your depressive episodes are just sadness because they mistake (hypo)manic episode for being happy again. When I was diagnosed with bipolar ll very few people believed it because it didn't fit the stereotype. I think that's why it's so hard for people to get help and it takes reaching the near end to go "maybe this isn't normal." [info] None [info] 1500235136
Gijsss1 [info] Thanks for that reply, I appreciate it.Personally 2 reasons are the ones why I’m drawn to psychedelics, the lack of purpose which I mentioned and also wanting to face my subconscious, with which I mean my unprocessed emotional trauma’s.I do have to admit that 10 months ago I was diagnosed with bipolar, if i’m completely honest.Having said that, I wouldn’t ever have even considered psychedelics if I felt like I couldn’t handle them or wasn’t stable enough.Among bipolar patients i’ve also read of mixed experience.Would you recommend I steer clear of psychedelics if I’m bipolar?

momscakeday [info] Hey, I read it. That is indeed a really stressful chain of events that would set anybody off who might have depressive or bipolar tendencies. So don't be too hard on yourself if you can help it.I was diagnosed with bipolar II eh maybe 5 years ago now, though I was a bit suspicious before that, and I've had serious depressive issues since puberty (which was a long time ago now, sigh). The couple ideas I would offer based on my own experience are:* Absolutely, totally, 1000%, getting sleep regulated is Step 0 of any management of bipolar. For nearly everyone with bipolar, it is critical in order to stay stable. Most of us tend to have lifelong sleep weirdness of one kind or another - me for example, I'm an extreme night owl if left completely to my own devices. And I prefer the night. But it turns out it's f#$%ing terrible for me to be nocturnal. I am absolutely thoroughly convinced that getting my sleep under control (with a regimen of daytime light exposure and evening microdose melatonin) was fundamental to my recovery, and I worked to learn my limits as far as variance, etc, so I can keep it regulated now. Because the surest way to a "mood excursion" is messed up sleep.* It would be good to find a good therapist and hopefully also a support group or something like that as well (e.g. DBSA, NAMI, or even something like a Stitch N Bitch, a faith group, sports/exercise group, etc). Meds alone really don't cut it for a lot of bipolar people, and often bipolar can be complex enough that it takes a while to find the right meds even so. It can really help to have a good therapist. My rule of thumb (can you tell I've been thru this grind MANY times yet?) is that if you don't click well by the end of the 3rd session, find somebody else. Which I know is a HUGE pain and a challenge. But it's really worth it to have a therapist you actually relate well with, vs one that's merely okay.* Finally, if at all possible, and despite it probably seeming like the last thing you want to do, it might also be good to directly ask your parents to increase their involvement on "the little things" in terms of you living at home. This may well not be appropriate for you, but I've found that living with people who are naturally chatty and will say things - without nagging! but just making a note of it - like "oh I haven't seen you at breakfast for a couple days, are you sleeping okay?" or making sure you're aware of when meals are happening and that they'd like you around, without judgement if you do need a day or two off.... this is SUPER helpful to keeping me engaged in the household, which in turn regulates my mood and keeps me moving forward better. This can feel awkward at first but to me it's so helpful. I feel like it's sort of like a cobbled together version of IPSRT, which is a therapy for bipolar (which I haven't yet tried) that focuses on keeping us stable by keeping us integrated with other people. Isolation is very very damaging for many of us, and that absolutely includes me, even though I have reclusive tendencies and often really do need to withdraw! It can be a fuzzy line. As long as you're aware and are trying to find yours, that's what matters :)Good luck, I really hope things start looking a bit better for you soon, and just a side note I'm sorry to hear about the girl. That would have crushed me as well. I find personally that I tend to come on real strong once somebody gets "in" enough that I'm willing to open up to them, and I've scared more than one good person off this way. Kinda comes with the territory sometimes. But there really, really, really are more fish in the sea, eventually one will swim your way, and hopefully it will be one who is a little more adept at handling sensitive people. Hoping for the best for you! [info] None [info] 1559256522

To this day it still frustrates me when he starts crying/screaming, but I take a minute to collect myself and go to my son and care for him. I'm on medication and it still isn't perfect.Talk to a doctor. Get help. It sounds like the old anti-depressant you were on was the wrong one for your body. There is one out there for you that won't make you feel worse and drug you into a stupor. I'm on a handful of pills and I can still function throughout the day without feeling like I am in a stupor.

gold_miner_94 [info] I understand the cornered feeling. Listen, I'm a sufferer of bipolar disorder and childfree. I've struggled with just getting out and meeting people. I've struggled with keeping relationships together during manic episodes. I can promise you from someone who has been to very dark places that there is hope, and there are more women out there who don't spring this crap. This subreddit is full of them!&amp;nbsp;That one in a million feeling is in reality brain chemistry and hormones. I met the one in a million girl once. Didn't want kids, smart, chemical engineering student. The day she found out I was diagnosed with bipolar she left me on the spot. I was miserable and swore off dating for months. When I finally got back into dating all I could think about was her. You know what ended that? Seeing other people who weren't her. Didn't matter that the relationships didn't pan out, I just began to see that she wasn't a unicorn or a 1 in a million girl. She was a person with her own flaws and problems, like me. I finally met a girl who is understanding of the fact I will forever live with bipolar and that I choose to remain CF, which she is also. She's not a 1 in a million find.

apricotasd28 [info] &gt; He is coherent. "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and the NFL. He looked at my brain. It’s equal on three parts. I’m gonna go ahead and drop some bombs for you: 98th percentile IQ test. I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting numbers backwards, so I’m gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent. Tesla. Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn’t bipolar. I had sleep deprivation, which can cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now, where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name. So all this power that I got—and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that—I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosage."Very stable. Very much stable genius. Indeed stable.

fabioelfabuloso [info] I always knew that religion could cause some major mental disorders due to the oppression and dogma. However, it wasn't until recently that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depersonalization, and dissociation. I can have an entire day with a mental lapse of what transpired. I've emailed my therapist in panic and tears, only to not having remembered writing any of the words I used. These lapses are terrifying, and it's absolutely a way for your brain to protect itself, albeit awful. You're not alone, and it took me years to realize that these disorders could have very well been opened due to trauma of living as a regular pioneer in a strict household, to then losing faith and family. it's an incredible trauma. I highly recommend finding a good therapist, and discovering these truths for yourself. Discover why your brain does what it does, what causes it. Learning these truths has saved my life multiple times. Don't forget, each mental slip up is a learning opportunity towards mental success. [info] None [info] 1546981795
TheHonourableCurls [info] Around my freshmen year I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my way of coping was being a condescending demeaning prick to everyone. My grandfather and father were the exact same so I guess that's why I adapted that behavior as appropriate. But throughout high school no one pointed it out to me, I had friends so it didn't really bother me. It wasn't until I moved out and was one my own traveling and working that people actually told me I was an asshole. They explained why and how and for a while my outlook was "Well I've made it this far, why should I change for others?" Then it got the point where I was in a relationship with my now prepossessing girlfriend that I realized it was a problem and I had to change for her. It got to the point where I would act that way towards her and I could see she felt like a piece of shit when I spoke like that towards her. It's like seeing your mother cry. No matter what, even if it's your fault, it's the most deplorable feeling ever. So I changed, I talked to my girlfriend about it, decided I should get some help to figure things out and see what needed to be done. That was about 2 years ago and we've been together for almost 3 years now and we're happier then we ever were. I've been receiving the help I needed. Now whenever I see someone I knew in school I simply apologize for how I used to be, not that it really matters or that they remember but if it were me I'd appreciate someone doing that.

zebrapig [info] I also have bipolar.    Never be afraid to ask if you can step off the floor. I have had some pretty intense episodes and all it takes is one customer to set me off. If you think your SS or SM might not allow that, I would talk to your SM in advance as a precaution. You could probably even get a doctors note if you needed to.  I can channel my manic episodes into being a badass at work, but my coworkers all joke that I'm always in a bad mood or that I hate everything because I've been more depressed lately. If you can fake it enough to handle the customers, I wouldn't give a single shit about what anyone else says. If "coaching" is anything like it is at my store, I would honestly not worry too much about it. I'm to the point now where I am confident that I can recognize what is needed from me to serve the customer and still let them have a speedy and friendly transaction and if it means me breaking away from deployment for a second, so be it. If this "coaching" is personal or just nagging, without any sbu standard to back it up, bring it up with your SM because that shit is annoying and just a result of people being power hungry.    Also, if you're not already, meds and support groups are extremely helpful and a great outlet when dealing with stress like this. If you ever need to chat, please don't be afraid to send me a message on here. I was diagnosed with bipolar close to 5 years ago, I have been at sbux for a year and a half now and I will agree that it is super challenging sometimes. Good luck out there! :) [info] None [info] 1397263338
NotTheSharpestCacti [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in December 2016. To clarify, bipolar disorder is not what you see in media where I would switch moods super quick or change from angry to crying to loving in five minutes. Not that that CAN'T happen, however rapid-cycling still doesn't look very much like the media presents it. I've been on and off medication since my diagnosis, trying to find the one that works. Currently off meds, so honestly life hasn't changed that much. I get depressed for periods of time, lay in bed, don't go to class, don't eat, have no motivation to exist. And then I get manic, and spend too much money, go out and drink a little too much, sleep 2-4 hours a night, start projects I'll never finish. Not that I'm trying to down play the severity of being diagnosed with bpd, however getting a diagnosis doesn't change who I am, it just gives me an explanation for my behavior. Edit: r/bipolar exists, in case anyone ever needs any resources or understand it a little better. [info] None [info] 1521427207
kirolm [info] I started when I was 13.I cut my arms and wore long sleeves all the time (I live in Texas, if that tells you anything about how much this stood out). It was an outlet to get some release from issues I was having that I couldn't even put into words. It not only was a cry for help I didn't quite understand, when my family found out my mother couldn't stop blaming herself, my sisters were scared and angry on the off chance I was doing it for attention (it sounds fucked up but is not uncommon and it is an understandable reaction due to the high emotions flying everywhere), and it fucked up a lot of relationships, both romantic and platonic.I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 15 after a 3-week "voluntary" psych ward stint (My mother called the ambulance. They told me they either took me in or foot me with the $1000ish dollar ambulance bill) and set on anti-depressants and therapy. I relapsed and went back into psych wards at ages 17 and 19 (Probably tied to my inability to provide for my newborn at the time due to all my issues). I stopped cutting around then and have been doing my best to keep up with child support, take care of myself, work and have a good life.I had two relapses at ages 23 after a really bad breakup and during a cruise last year when things came to a head resulting in my current divorce. How's that for TMI :DAnywho, I am stable and I know that cutting is a symptom, albeit one that is more easy to avoid and manage with good habits than others. Having things that get my mind off things (my guitar, writing, gaming) help put me in a better state of mind before making any big decisions.Hope that gives you a bit of insight? :D I am now 27.

BlakeBarnes00 [info] [Relationship] Girlfriend of a year and a half just left me.. So I've dated this girl for one and a half years, meet her last April and asked her out in three days. We never argue or anything until later on in the relationship as well we always did nice things together, I got her into PC gaming last year, and we started to play a lot of games together bringing the bond closer. We didn't only play games though, we did tons of other things such as go on dates, hang out a lot, and watch stuff together. Everything seemed just perfect...I was diagnosed with bipolar at 16 (yes before anybody says it's not possible, it sure is under certain cases like mine), this led to problems such as my mood couldn't be really helped much at all because when I'm down, I'm really down. She started to feel like she wasn't helpful. I kept having to reassure her that she was the best, and that this is something that she didn't have to help with. She then started understanding. (This was about 6 months into the relationship)Around 8 months into the relationship my family started struggling financially, we could barely afford to pay for food, so her family started to help take care of me. They offered me the room in their house that nobody used, they helped me with my problems, even my breaking down that would happen. I was just all around accepted. While this happened, I was struggling in school academically because I was placed in all honors and AP classes, which when you're constantly flowed with that work and having problems you have to deal with about yourself and family, it's rough...  To pile it all up on top of that, these guys started flirting with her. I never knew about it, she said she didn't want to worry me so she didn't tell me, which of course made it worse. So I started getting really worried and down all the time thinking about it. I was stupid and thought about my own discomforts sometimes and asked her to stop talking to some of them, I thought it was only fair because she did would do it to me. (Keep in mind I'm not sociable so I barely had friends myself)Jealousy really started bringing the relationship down around this time. Seemed to me when she got defensive about these guys that's what she wanted. She would always tell me she was jealous of a girl and my solution was to start pushing them away if she felt that way about them. Which helped her. This led to her having control over everything like that. (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Steam.. Ect. Where constantly checked to make sure nothing was going on with me, completely limiting me) After I confronted her about this, she understood. We talked and agreed that we would both drop certain people for one another to fix it all. This made us happy for the next two months. My parents were getting new jobs.. In Florida. This tore my girlfriend and even family apart. I ended up attempting suicide, regret it now. There was a battle going on between my family and myself, some taking my side and others not. I wanted to stay and finish high school and go to college in SC, so my girlfriends family offered to take me in. Parents shut it down, so my grandpa then tried. They shut that down, they stopped letting me talk to him for a while. My parents didn't let me go to school for about a week so I couldn't attempt running away or anything or try getting help from the school. This sucked. We were then long distance. The first couple months started rough, but we did it really well. We called each other during school and slept on Skype at night. We watched Netflix together and just played games. We had a blast. I made plans with my new school.to graduate early and move back there next year in January, where I would also be considered an adult so I couldn't be held back from doing it. I didn't tell her about this plan until about a month ago. The papers and stuff are all ready and it's confirmed so now I'm kind of stuck with it. The last month (leading up to last night), I started to get told from her friends that they think there is another guy. I started realizing that she has grown more distance and started hanging up when I heard a guy/s talking to her at school. If I would confront her about said guy/s, she would start getting mad and ignore me for the rest of the day. Her friends would try helping but this only made it worse. She had made it where I was dependent on her, so she knew if she ignored me things would go wrong on my side. She knew I didn't have friends, because I got along better with girls than guys. She knew my parents wouldn't help. And her friends would start to get overwhelmed by me breaking down, they realized what she was doing to me, they realized how unfair it was. They confronted her about it and she blew up. My girlfriend and her girlfriend (we had a somewhat open relationship for her side anyways, she could see other girls) were talking last night. I was having a breakdown, her girlfriend was trying to help me but my girlfriend wouldn't help. She was just watching it. Her girlfriend then got tired of me breaking down and blocked me. They started ignoring me both leaving me alone breaking down. They went and talked all night as this happened... I got a messaged saying that we were done this morning. They are now together as probably even her and one of said guys. I don't know what to do... I'm sorry for the long read, but I needed to get it out somewhere..Re: Thank you all, I have started doing what you guys have suggested and it has helped so far today. [info] 16 [info] 1465053382
a-small-pintobean [info] Can negative response to a medication change over time/which meds are safe for epileptics I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about a year ago (at age 19) and put on seroquel. I hate this medication because I gained over 10 kilos and I get really terrible side effects every time I take it (breathing problems, heart racing, really bad dizziness). But the doctors in the clinic I was diagnosed in told me there weren’t many bipolar meds I could take because I also have epilepsy and a lot of antipsychotics apparently trigger seizures.In a few weeks I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist where I’ll ask to be put on a different medication.Now to my real question: I’ve heard that many people have good experience with lamictal. As many probably know lamictal is an anti convulsant. It was actually the first medication I was put on when I was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 12. First it helped but over time I got small rashes and my seizures returned. At age 15 I was put on depakote for epilepsy and stopped taking lamictal.However, I’ve thought about asking my psychiatrist to try lamictal for bipolar since it’s been such a long time I’ve last taken it. Does anybody know if our bodies can change in that way? That maybe now I won’t have these side effects with lamictal?And if not, does anybody know of any bipolar meds you can take as an epileptic besides the meds aforementioned? Especially ones that are more weight-neutral than seroquel since that is a really big deal for me!Thank you [info] None [info] 1580585647
SassySagittarius [info] I literally thought this was my mother, no joke.

I'd just leave her be, she's finding herself and becoming more "adult" which is hard to do living with mom and sis away and away from her new "life" of college, boys, etc. Maybe do an occasional check to make sure she's not depressed or anything, I was just diagnosed with bipolar and these things tend to pop up around our age, but otherwise let her know that you're there for her if she needs you and cut the umbilical cord.

sicklylover [info] I feel like I didn't choose my life; it chose me. Wish I could choose something else. I'm married, in my late 20s, just bought a house five months ago, with a stable job and I realized that I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up. When I was younger, I struggled a lot. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 15. Before that, I had a lot of trauma. I ended up at 5 different high schools, including two residential treatment programs. But I kept pushing through all the bullshit, hoping for a brighter future. So I survived. Instead of drugs, I turned to homework. Being in a locked facility, I had nothing else to do but my homework. I got good grades, got a scholarship to college. In college, shit got real. I struggled some, I succeeded in other ways. From there, I kept looking forward and applied to graduate school. I went to graduate school for counseling. I figured it was all I knew for half my life; might as well learn to do it properly. In grad school, I met my wife. We married this past year. I graduated and got a great job working a dream for someone in my position. I make decent money with great hours (no on-call or overtime or weekends, yay!) and here I am. But the thing is; I don't think I want any of this. I feel like I chose this because it was all I knew. I was exposed to the mental health system from such a young age and now I'm just on the other side of the metaphorical and sometimes literal couch. I'm not trying to brag but I know that I'm good at what I do. I get good work reviews. I lead trainings. By all measures, successful. But I feel like I'm only here because it was all I was exposed to. In my most formative years, the years where the future is mine for the taking, it was taken from me by the mental health system. So here I am. I have a wife and a mortgage and a dog and a great job but it doesn't feel like mine and it doesn't even feel like I chose it. Not really anyway. I was so focused on moving forward that I didn't stop to see where I was going. [info] None [info] 1485393607

kandlestiiick [info] Im constantly questioning my diagnosis. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 about 3 1/2 years ago when I was 19. Before that, I had no idea what was wrong with me. I was abusive to my boyfriend (I still beat myself up for that). I would get into these bouts of rage and I was like a totally different person. It was like my brain was having a war within itself. I didn't want to be angry and I tried to calm down, but then it would get worse because I had to "go there" before I could calm down. Scary as fuck. Then I would go spend almost all of my money on clothes or food or anything. To this day, I've only managed to save $300. One time I tried to go off my meds because I felt fine and was convinced my therapist was overreacting. I was staying at my new boyfriend's house and I purposely planned to do it then so I wasn't alone in case I couldn't handle it. It was one of the worst depressive episodes I've ever had. That was a couple years ago, but I'm getting to that point again where I want to go off my meds. I'm sick of relying on medication to keep me stable. Fuck.  [info] None [info] 1487731919

Although the diagnosis explains a lot, I just don't know if it is right. I've only met with this psychiatrist once, and it seems pretty irresponsible to gove such a strong diagnosis after one meeting.Here's why I'm so conflicted; this is not the first time somone has suggested that I may have this. At the same time, as dumb as this may sound, I don't feel bipolar. I have had several very low deppression stages in my life, but it seems extreme. I want to know, did anybody here "feel" bipolar before they were diagnosed? How did you react after recieving your diagnosis?

stopmillion [info] Hello ! When I was 17 I was so depressed and suicidal I knew I had to get help but I did not want to tell my parents myself. I gathered up the courage to go to a guidance counselor at my high school.... I'm not going to lie it was hard to do. I felt like I was choking. Keep in mind if you do this they're required by law to call ur parents... And if you say ur suicidal they might send you to the hospital... Be careful what you tell them. If you do this I would say "I'm extremely depressed can you please call my parents and tell them I need professional help". That's basically what I did. It was awkward af with my parents after for a while but to be frank I needed them to pay for the help I desperately needed. I was diagnosed with bipolar maybe 2 years later. Good luck... I would really recommend just gathering up the courage and telling someone. If you don't things could get worse. Good luck and I really do know how hard it is  [info] None [info] 1515639536

BarleyBreakfast [info] Effexor withdrawal, Lamotrigine titration, combatting the brain fog? Good Morning All,I was diagnosed with bipolar II a few days ago. Immediately was told to start weaning off of effexor and start titrating on to lamotrigine. I run a small business, and have eight people I directly manage and direct throughout the day, while handling any customer problems and purchasing, receivables etc. etc. I have to be on the ball at work. I'm currently transitioning into management, and I need to be sharp. I've always been sharp, or at least have come across as sharp anyway. I'm on day 2 in a row with no effexor, and don't have any brainzaps or anything (I was only on 75mg, down to 37.5 a week ago), however I'm finding myself exhausted and completely spaced out. I keep forgetting what I'm doing while I'm doing it. I can't be having this right now. I wouldn't care if it weren't for my job, but my job is really important to me and one of the very few things I haven't destroyed in the last 9 months. My boss doesn't even know about my last two stays in hospital. He left the company in my hands while he's on vacation.Does anyone have any good tips on battling this? I'm going to wean the effexor more slowly to start, but anything else? Apparently vitamins and all that. I've been taking vitamins and trying to get at least 8 hours of sleep right now and plenty of water. Is there medication that can help? My understanding is that during early bipolar treatment, stimulants are not a good idea as they can trigger hypomania or mania, so I'm trying to see if there are any other options.Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

Torreau [info] All forms of hormonal birth control destroyed my drive and eventually over the course of about 7-8 years it just made me off-my-rocker crazy; we're talking white hot rage over stupid things, like that he didn't notice the floor needed to be swept or that he went out for a drink with friends after work.I know that this is somewhat common, however in my case it wound up being a sign of something more, and the fact that you mention mood issues sets off alarm bells for me. When I went off the hormones I felt better for quite a while but then my moods started to go nuts again and I realized that the birth control just amplified what I would have gone through anyway.

Duckdusk [info] Is this hypomania or is life just so good again? I've been veeery depressed for a while and I've been going through some awful stuff lately.Yesterday I suddenly felt ME again! I got myself back after being so dependent on someone who was so toxic! And now I'm ME again and I feel soooo goooood!!!But I can't help but think... is this just my hypomania kicking in? I wouldn't mind to be honest cause it feels so good. Life is good again!I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 just recently and I'm not on meds yet cause they said it's mild. I also have BPD by the way.Anyway, I CAN sleep! I actually get tired and sleepy sometimes... I just don't want to! I'm probably also trying to trigger some good mood and since I know that sleeping always gets me depressed, I'm trying to sleep less maybe (?). Yesterday night I also had pressured speech and I hated when people tried to get words in cause they spoke so slowly and my mind was racing and I needed so much to get the words out! But I didn't feel paranoia at all and I'm also pretty chill and relaxed right now, I think I'm fine!Edit to add: I feel waves of happiness and energy. They hit hard at first and then go away slowly, only to come back and hit again! It feels amazing to be honest and my heart is racingEdit2: ok my mind is screaming at me right now, but I'm sitting still on my comfy chair just keeping track of what's going on inside of me!Do you think I should still talk to my doc about it?

SagiTsukiko [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a teen despite not having manic episodes of any sort. I was abused and traumatized, and surprise, i acted like i was abused and traumatized. I learned how to control myself through dialectical behavioral therapy and processing what's happened to me on my own using the skills i learned there. I basically learned coping skills and social skills I was not previously taught because I wasn't socialized well as a child and did not have any healthy models for emotions. Explicit discussion of psychiatric diagnoses was banned in the group i attended.  As an aside, I really hate how literal children will be diagnosed with a "chemical imbalance" and get doped up with neuroleptics and lithium when they're actually being abused at home. Never met a kid with a happy home life during the 12+ times i was involuntarily committed as a teenager. [info] None [info] 1571091682
crazydoctor674 [info] I'm feeling uplifted today after thanking and apologizing to my teacher. Well, the title itself sums up what I'm going to say today.I'm going to be turning 16 in a few days time and it was teacher's appreciation week in the place where I lived. I didn't get many gifts for many of my teachers but I did manage to thank several of my teachers in elementary school as well as  my current teachers. However, I got into a deep conversation with a teacher ( we will call her Ms Sarah). Let's get Into a little back story of mine that I am willing to share.3 years ago, I was a happy, carefree 13 year old who would spend his time playing  pokemon GO. But when I  went into grade 8, I became a victim of bullying ( I really can't remember why)  then I became depressed and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I would spend my time feeling sad for myself and constantly feel dead on the inside. Ms Sarah who didn't even teach me knew as she would take my class for chapel sessions but she  observed me during periods. She always noticed that I would sit away from the rest of my friends and either sleep or read a book.One such day, I think I was bullied again but this time I had a melt down during her period. She started to talk to me, counsel me and gave me space to reflect on how I felt as well as loads of advice.  Everyday since then for about a year she greeted me in the morning and ask me how I was doing every single day. ( she was one the most caring teachers I met). After that I moved on to a different class made loads of friends and I completely started to ignore her in the morning ( I was 15, I thought I was old enough to manage things on my own) and whenever she said hi or asked me a question I acted like she was non-existant to me. She still waved at me and was kind to me though I displayed such crude mannerisms. (After that I understood that I needed her as she guided me and cared about me) Fastfoward to last week I managed to talk to Ms sarah and apologise for my crude mannerisms as well as to thank her for being so patient and kind to me. ( I still do feel guilty that I wanted her out of my life as I thought that she was a nosy Parker)tl;dr I am thanking my caring teacher for guiding me through my ups and downs and being extremely patient when I was being very apathetic towards her care and concern to me. ( really made me feel so much better) First post from a relatively new redditor, thank you. [info] None [info] 1568202560
CaseyAPayne [info] I want to start with **culture shock is real**. Everyone reacts to it differently.Then I want to say **be kind to yourself**. I'm not suggesting this, and I will add thoughts on how to counter this shortly but... embrace the fact that maybe you won't be able to "get your shit together" while alone in a foreign country. If you don't get the PROTIPs you need from this thread, or you do and drop the ball on applying them. That's OK. Be kind to yourself.Alright... here's my PROist of PROTIPs.First, **get an accountability partner**. Someone that you're going to check in with EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The check-in might be super simple. Maybe you just send a "y" letting them know you did "the thing" that day. If you send an "n" you need to explain to them why it was an "n". I think a good friend or family member works best, but maybe you have a digital friend that could work.Second, **write down exactly what you'll be checking in about**. I know you have dreams of doing 8-10 hours of work a day and attending all of your classes, but start with the smallest, IMPOSSIBLE TO FAIL, thing and build up from there. **Maybe all you'll be checking in about each day is doing one Pomodoro cycle**. If you do that, you're a winner. If you do more... AWESOME! But... don't worry about doing more. Worry about doing one.Third, **build on your daily success**. One Pomodoro might become eight. Perhaps along with it you also do 30 minutes of walking a day and meditate. Once you build up this daily muscle it gets easier to add more to it and you'll also become aware of what is, and is not, feasible to do.**BACKSTORY**I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years ago. I've had to dig myself out of depressed states more than a few times. The last time I had to do it was the worse because I had grown accustomed to "waiting until I felt better" and then... slowly getting back into the swing of things. This time a year had gone by and I was still playing video games 10-14 hours a day (Destiny when it first came out), not showering, living at grandma's house, etc. and... just felt empty/hopeless. I'm actually one of those super upbeat dudes all about goals (when not like that) and... goals just weren't working. There were three times that year I wrote out goals I wanted to do and I totally failed at doing them. They were super weak too (brush my teeth, shower, make the bed, etc.)What finally got me out of that loop was choosing a single goal that I didn't think I could fail at (which I had  already earlier that year) and called my brother and said "I'm going to send you a text message every day before 10:30 pm letting you know if I made the bed or not." After I knew someone was "watching" me and I knew there was no reason to fail I immediately changed. There were a few times I squeezed in making the bed at 10:25 pm, but I never missed a day. It took about 50+ days for it to become automatic, but I built on to that (brushing teeth, showering, etc.) until it got up to exercising, writing, meditating, bed early, etc.Anyhow, I know you want/need to "GO BIG" right away. Even though that's the case, ramp up to it a bit. Start with one Pomodoro and if you win, or do more, ramp it up the next day. Check-in with your accountability partner and when you fail, explain why. The explanation isn't for shaming or anything. It's to learn and adjust for the next day.Kudos for trying to figure this out! The human brain is a complex organism and human life is unnecessarily complex... :P Good luck! [info] None [info] 1562241369
tv_peddler [info] questions about LOA So, about 10 days ago, I attempted to end my life with pills and beer, obviously I failed. I went in the next day and talked to my manager about a LOA, went to the ER, and was admitted an inpatient facility where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on many meds, after a 6 day stay. I dont feel like I am ready to go back to work, but I have no idea when the doctor put my return date as and I'm confused as to what to do next. [info] None [info] 1469078203
captaincannibal [info] I overdosed on Moxy and now THC triggers psychosis This probably won’t be a well-liked post here but I still feel that this is worth discussing. I promise you that nothing in this post is fabricated or even exaggerated in any way. This is exactly what happens.So I actually made a post about this a little while back. Since then, I finally figured out two important things - this happens only when weed is involved. Also.. that it's *psychosis*.- [Moxy - Trip Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/3mc96f/moxy_trip_report/)- [Trip Report - 6-APB / 4-AcO-DMT / 5-MeO-MiPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/5h8rwf/trip_report_6apb_4acodmt_5meomipt/) - From what I've been told I *did* smoke during this but apparently forgot? I'd also like to say that this combo was incredibly stupid and I take full responsibility for that. You can easily see the psychosis in there though. - [I overdosed on Moxy and potentially broke my brain](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6vsuvn/i_overdosed_on_moxy_once_and_potentially_broke_my/)The first post kind of summarizes the first time I had this happen (and has a link to the trip report), but just a quick recap - a while back, I took some Moxy and had a great time. I decided to smoke some on top of a bowl eventually. Turns out my scale was fucked and I actually ended up smoking a shitload. I’m still not sure how much, but I know I had something like 250mg total in my bag and it was almost completely gone when I became lucid again. I should’ve recognized it sooner but my brain during psychosis sort of *refuses* to see the real pattern. My most recent experience was 3-MeO-PCP and weed and the entire time, I was absolutely certain that this was all caused by 3-MeO-PCP. Even though I only tried it less than a year ago. If I tried to think of something else that could cause it, I entered an intense thought loop where I could only see myself insufflating some of it and I could only hear the name repeated over and over in my head. This happens with any amount of THC - it happens with bud, wax, and even edibles. _______________________I’ll summarize what I experience when this happens:- Intense “seizures”. I begin to repeatedly clack my teeth together very hard. It’s like I’m shivering. My body will also seize up for a few seconds at a time where everything becomes stiff and I can’t move. - My brain literally starts to think in a way that is foreign to me. It’s incredibly difficult to describe. - An overwhelming feeling of dread and doom, like someone is standing behind me with a gun and I know I'm fucked.- I begin to recognize patterns that do not exist. Everything seems like a big puzzle and suddenly I’m seeing how the pieces fit together. - I become convinced that what is happening to me has never happened to another human being and that I need to be studied. I’m the key to understanding the universe. - I also become convinced that someone or something does not like that I’m finding the answers to all of life’s mysteries. This is because of [“thought blocking”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_blocking). If I have some realization that I think is important, my thoughts will start to be ripped from my mind. The way I interpret it is that something is doing it on purpose to keep me away from whatever that revelation was. - I get beyond confused. While everything makes sense to me, I can’t actually interpret anything surrounding me. It all seems foreign. The floor itself confuses the shit out of me. - I get insane vertigo - wherever I’m laying starts to spin rapidly and I feel like I’m going to puke. - If I’m lying down, the room tilts (visually). This combined with the vertigo makes me think I’m starting to fall. - Every fiber of my being experiences extremely uncomfortable euphoria. - Weird ass dissociative-type visuals. My vision becomes filled with gears and machine-like objects. At some point I’ll full-on have external hallucinations that change where I’m at, what’s around me, etc. I start to see that I’m outside, at a completely different time, seeing people that don’t exist and things that I’ve never seen. Except I believe I have seen them before. - Eventually I stop noticing my body. I feel completely disembodied, like I’m just a consciousness. - I become convinced that, because of how my brain is acting, there is some cosmic conspiracy concerning me. - My thoughts become very disorganized. I cannot stay on a subject for more than a few seconds before I jump to something else and lose the thought. - My speech makes zero sense. I’ll either change subjects mid-sentence and not realize if, or I’ll forget what I was saying. A good example is, “yeah so then I went to the car and and I went to the car and I went to uh.. and.. uh.. wait was I just talking? what's going on?"- I rapidly move through images in my head of areas I don’t recognize - except I do. My brain tells me that I’m having crazy deja vu and these are all places I recognize. I also start to believe that these are things other people are seeing that are being beamed to my brain..- Just in general I get crazy deja vu. I believe that what is happening to me is identical to the last time it happened - where I’m at, who I’m with, what I did that day. I think hard and begin to say “I should’ve recognized this. This day happened before. I remember it all”. That day never happened before. But my mind is placing importance on every event leading up to that moment. - I start to hear multiple voices but they’re all my own. It’s like I have multiple internal voices, all having different thoughts at the same time. - I honestly think that the only way out of it is to kill myself. It’s like someone else is putting that thought in to my brain. It isn’t my own thought. There’s a lot more to this but it’s almost indescribable. My idea of psychosis never was like this because this thought pattern makes NO sense to me once I’m sober. Again, it’s downright foreign. The main takeaways are that my thoughts become incredibly disorganized and very dark, and my brain starts to place importance on every single thing that it brings up - notice I say that *it* brings up. Not me. Because it feels like I have zero control over my own thoughts._________________________________To really freak you out, I’ll share some pieces of the notes I tried to take the last time this happened. To me, they made perfect sense and were easy to understand. Until I sobered up. Usually once I’m sober I get embarrassed and delete the notes. You’ll see that when I’m in psychosis, I actively believe that something is tricking me in to deleting them so that I don’t share them with anyone. So yeah, this is really embarrassing but here you go:“*avoid november 29th and do not work on the sunday after thanksgiving. this is the day that this happens every time. dont watch eric andre either you get in to that and then this happens i always come back to this day it is a time loop that will n stop ever i will always have this happen again**this is fucked. you had enough to know. so they forced you in to deleting**I remember every other time this happens I think “it will happen again. and again. always.” and each time i have my own memories but when i go there it gets comformed without breaking**god dammit i was so closei was so closedo not let it back in and he’s forced to go back to try and repair it. this is critical for this to work at all. you need to avoid this scenario like the plague. it is destroying you.**this is not losing time as in your memory doesn’t work, this ismissing time as in my brain loses its understanding of time and because i can’t process it and move forward through the day everything suddenly falls apart.**my thoughts are spilling out in to the UNIVERSAL CONCUOUSNESS. there are shadows moving around me they are coming they are coming theyarexo coming coming they coming oh no oh no o no”*Yep. There’s honestly more to it but it’s a lot of personal info and it gets even more embarrassing than that, believe it or not. As you can see, my brain really is placing importance on insignificant days and events that occurred recently - here, I was convinced that because this day was some sort of "time loop" that I kept coming back to, the events leading up to it (me working on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the actual date itself, and WATCHING THE FUCKING ERIC ANDRE SHOW) were all things that I need to recognize in the future to avoid getting pulled back in to the time loop. I fully believed that I had experienced all of that lead-up before (because of intense deja vu). I also get stuck in thought loops and continually lose track of what I was thinking about.__________________________________So someone is going to ask why I even smoke then - it’s weird. I actually feel drawn to it, even though what happens is absolutely horrifying and eventually I’m probably not going to come back from it.. I finally decided to just give up because I’m going to regret it soon. It really blows because I grew up just smoking a metric fuckton of weed.Now that I finally found that it’s psychosis, I can get out of it by taking seroquel - not because it stops it, but because it knocks me the fuck out for a while. If anyone’s wondering why I have seroquel, it’s because a few months after the Moxy overdose I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don’t think the Moxy caused it, but it probably brought it out a lot more. I always had issues with my mood going up and down but after that it started to get a lot more noticeable and was causing some serious issues in my life. I'm no longer prescribed seroquel but I still have a shitload of it. There are some other interesting reports about this happening to others. [Here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:17mg_3-MeO-PCP_%26_Cannabis_oil_-_Terrifying_confusion) is a trip report that describes it all very well. And [here](https://news.vice.com/article/this-is-how-one-pot-smoker-learned-that-weed-plays-a-mysterious-role-in-psychosis) is an article about it happening to someone - my experience is basically identical to his in every way. I want to type a lot more but this post is huge and I’m on mobile and at work. If you guys find this interesting, google “cannabis psychosis” or something. You’ll find articles and studies on the subject. If anyone else has experience with this, please let me know. I’d love to hear more. **tl;dr** - REEFER MADNESS___________________________**EDIT** - Almost forgot an interesting tidbit. So far I've experienced three distinct "types" of psychosis. I've experienced each one multiple times.- **Fun psychosis** - It isn't actually that fun but I'm *extremely* manic during this. My thoughts are not dark unless I start to enter a thought loop. Still, my brain does not work the way it should. I don’t get paranoia but I do get pronoia at times, believing that the universe is trying to help me. Also worth noting that I am not spiritual and I am very opposed to organized religion. So I seem to believe in some sort of divine plan during this, though I don’t necessarily believe it to be the work of any sort of god. Usually I believe it’s the universe itself or some beings from another reality.- **Cosmic psychosis** - This one is the one I experience the most and the one that prompted me to finally write the original post. This ones involves me believing that I am the mouthpiece for the universe and that I've discovered all of it's secrets. I become extremely dissociated during this. There is a lot of paranoia and pronoia involved here. I also jump to the conclusion that what I'm discovering is dangerous and some entity is trying to keep me from figuring out what's happening. - **Suicidal psychosis** - This scares me the most. I've gone through it twice and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy (if I even had one). This almost feels like the opposite of "cosmic psychosis" - I am very aware of my body and that I am alive and that I am a human being. Unfortunately, my mind gets stuck in thought loops that are trying to convince me to commit suicide. They mainly do this by convincing me that life is just fuckin' stupid. I don't get depressed or focus on bad things that happen to me. Most recently I remember I couldn't stop thinking about how "lame" life was.. I pictured myself with my wife, sitting at home, playing a game, listening to music - it all seemed fucking stupid and pointless and uninteresting. I couldn't bring myself to feel any sort of joy. I was convinced that I had to off myself because there was no coming back from this realization. As soon as I became lucid again I was back to normal and it had zero impact on me. For some reason my vision gets FUCKED with this. I start to sink in to whatever I'm laying or sitting on and I get intense sliding visuals - the entire room just slips in to itself as if I'm looking at a bunch of tectonic plates doing their thing.

peacefulcate815 [info] I can relate to some of this, as I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II almost a year ago. Keep on your meds, even when you don’t want to.

whatofthenight [info] Making plans, because I don't want to live like this. I've been ill for the last two years with an ongoing blood disorder, which has really made my life considerably more difficult - I still work, but it's all I can do to keep it up (despite my business making amazing accommodations for my situation). It'll kill me eventually, but slowly.The last eight weeks things have gotten considerably more difficult, and I feel like I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. If this is my life now, and for the long-term, I don't think I want it.The thing is - I've been diagnosed with bipolar (prior to getting sick - physically, I mean) and I'm really struggling to work out whether this is really as bad as it seems, or whether I'm depressed and that's leading me here.I'm not immediately about to end my life, but I'm self-harming more than ever (cutting is considerably easier when people get used to seeing you with bandages and surgical patches) and I'm starting to... Make plans.I don't have anyone else to talk to about it because I know they'd tell me "you're a fighter," and that kind of thing - which I just don't want to hear, because there's only so long you can fight for.So here I am... Any advice would be very much appreciated. [info] None [info] 1447011588
ecstasysnorter [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a little over a year ago, and basically there are periods in your life wherein you can't distinguish between reality and fantasy. I genuinely believed that I got possessed by a demon, that the government was transpiring against me, and that my life had become a reality show and every single thing i did was broadcasted live. This lead me to be afraid of taking showers or even pooping, and i had to do all my bathroom duties in pitch black with a single flashlight. I would also be alone in my room talking to mirrors and black tv screens with the perception that demons and God were talking to me through them. Very difficult and blurry times for me but I got through it, and it's made me stronger. After about 6 months of recovery, i'm in a much better place now and everything's pretty chill. Lead me to lose some friends though but then again fuck them. [info] None [info] 1526735555

INSERT_USERNAME___ [info] I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, too. My rationale for being open about my condition is to show others who may have negative views of people living with mental illness or are afraid to seek help that one can live a relatively normal life with serious mental illness.

redheadgurl1987 [info] Need help with confidence situation Here’s how my story started. At 18 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, at 19 I was put on disability for it. For 12 years I was incredibly sick. Now in my 30’s I’m coming out of it. I volunteer , I run a meetup and am going through a weight loss transformation. However the ‘ not having a job’ makes me feel less than other people. I’m an honest person who doesn’t like to lie so I end up telling the truth. Because of low confidence with this I’m doing poorly romantically. Being a currently obese woman doesn’t help much either. But my weight I can change. My fiscal situation I’ve accepted.

Menelly [info] And, once in a while it's both lifestyle choice *and* biology/medical condition type stuff.  ;)Once upon a time, I was 5'9 (OK, still am that) and 150 lbs or so (nowhere near that now...)  Then, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, went psychotic manic several times, and ended up on the med go round of a billion different psych meds, all of which tend to add pounds to the frame.  (Heard of Zyprexa?  The "joke" on that med is you'll gain 10 lbs filling the prescription.)  Now, I'm much larger than I used to be, and no, I don't eat as healthy as I should.  But that weight isn't shifting as long as I'm on a battery of psych meds, and I value sanity more than vanity.So yes, I may tuck into my Whopper (no mayo!) and apple fries (I'm not fond of the regular ones anyways) and someone is probably judging me cause I'm not tiny, and I don't care.  It's my life, and I'm more comfortable being me than I've been before.  :) [info] None [info] 1346727564
Q1e3t5r4w2 [info] I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 before BPD and I went through all the same things. None of the medications ever worked for me except benzos when I was having a really bad episode/panic attack. Sleeping pills never even put me to sleep just gave me headaches and made my mouth taste horrible. You could try buying him a DBT workbook and read it with him if you want to try to save money. Most therapists will just work through the DBT workbook with him. But there are other therapists who try different kinds of therapy specifically for past abuse and PTSD type disorders. I've had others try things like hypnotherapy and crystal healing... which never did anything lol. It might be more helpful for him to work through these things with a licensed therapist though because I know how hard it is to read a book while dealing with mental problems. I've been doing it on my own because I dont have health insurance and I've still been making a lot of progress. But sometimes it's easier to have a professional explain things to you. My last therapist just took pages of the DBT workbook and scanned them for me to take home though and I was paying her a lot of money so I guess I'm just jaded when it comes to therapy. Thank you for being there for him and trying to help him through this. Hes very lucky to have someone like you in his life who cares so much. :) [info] None [info] 1540637960
