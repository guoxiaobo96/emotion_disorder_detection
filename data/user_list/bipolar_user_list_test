FlyPolar [info] 31M for 35F. Have been dating LO for around 2 months now. About a week ago she bumped into her last ex and it brought back all sorts of bad mental issues, as a result she's asked for space while she sorts through them. I was fine for maybe a day?? Then the obsessive thoughts switching from elated ecstasy to gut wrenching anxiety started and haven't let up since. In February after a lifetime of mental unrest I was diagnosed with bipolar. Since being on medication my mental state has cleared up so much (with a lot of work as well as the meds). I've had some minor limerence episodes since then but this is a big one rearing up. I'm not stupid or in the depths of uncontrolled mental illness this time though! I found an issue with myself and got to researching what I can do about it.At about 3pm today I came to the realisation that the negative side of things was adult separation anxiety, then after a few searches I found a post about it in this sub."Limerence? What the hell is that". Proceed to me scouring the Wiki entry. It reads like a script to every relationship I had or wanted for all of my life, right back to the first girl I had a crush on.Despite my mood chart for the day being as low as it can get I'm so happy to have been able to put a name to the face of one of my biggest issues. I felt like I could've cried with happiness at one point.Can anyone recommend any good resources for managing the condition?
viral_snyde [info] I mean. I just dont have an attachment to being alive is the best way to put it. I dont care that I'm alive but I get so envious of death around me. I was suicidal for a long time and dealt with childhood abuse up until the age of 22. Things are better now and I'm fine. I ho to therapy, take my medication. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but my medication has it under control for the most part.I'm just not too keen on being alive. I just got informed my brother has a high possibility of being COVID positive and aside from the concern of the money involved, I'm actually quite excited. I mean, what if I get sick? Hopefully no one else does. Hopefully it can just be me and I can die from it.I just don't think I should be alive. It just feels wrong.
mattsulli [info] I had a fiancée before I married my wife. During an alcohol withdrawal stint at a hospital I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I never sought treatment and let my behavior get worse and worse until she finally left me. I beat myself up over and over again, cutting, lashing out, drinking, spending days crying and other days going out trying to get myself killed on the streets of Baltimore. When I spent a couple of years dealing with this and getting a little better, I met my now wife. I was honest with her about my disorder but lied pretty heavily about my past. When I eventually got on some insurance plan I started seeking treatment. I became more honest with my wife about my past because I began to understand that as long as I got better I could unload the truth and she would understand. She has. Past that, getting on meds and understanding the nature of my old behaviors has allowed me to come to terms with losing a woman whom I loved dearly. I don’t know why I’m typing all of this out. I’m just saying that this will pass like ever other terrible thing that’s happened to you and you will find someone who loves and supports you for who you are. Stay strong.
