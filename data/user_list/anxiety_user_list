amyth10 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 15 and  was thinking and feeling the same things you are. I would say you may have social anxiety but I would go to get an assessment by a doctor and if you have friends/family or someone at school to talk to tell them as talking does help and they may have some good advice for you. Hope you are okay x
StrivinForJoy [info] Yes, anxiety can manifest in various ways, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with your lungs or heart, that‚Äôs just health anxiety creeping up on you.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder in late January of this year.  Like you I had never any mental health issues before that, and suddenly I developed panic attacks one random morning. My panic attacks and anxiety was mainly all physical symptoms.  It went from a single panic attack that lasted 5-10 minutes, to long rolling panic attacks that lasted 5-6 hours.  This was physical anxiety symptoms like  heart racing, trouble swallowing, trouble breathing or taking a deep breath, arm and leg numbness, dizziness, stomach cramping,  vertigo, lightheadedness which led to mental exhaustion and fatigue after it was over.  After it kept getting worse and worse, I ended up getting on low dose Zoloft SSRI medication.  Since I‚Äôve been on it (11 weeks now), I haven‚Äôt had any major panic attacks like before, but I still tend to get physical anxiety symptoms time to time.  Some of it, I think is caused more by the medication than anything.  I‚Äôm trying to get off of it, because I hate the side effects, but I want figure out a plan first because you can‚Äôt stop abruptly. Which medication are you on? And how long?  Sorry your parents don‚Äôt believe in mental health issues.  Everything your saying is classic anxiety and panic disorder symptoms.   Message me if you want to talk more about it. Hope you feel better!
Angrylion1012 [info] It depends on you and your healing process. Sometimes I'll think I am okay...the nightmares stop for months...and out of nowhere, something very minor can trigger a whole onslaught. :/ I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, eating disorder and insomnia because of my past traumas. :/ It's a struggle. Everyone says, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger...", but sometimes I wish my abuser did and just got the suffering over with. 
Lordkeravrium [info] Honestly, things like these do kind of bother me. Especially when people claim I‚Äôm bluffing. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD at eight by a developmental pediatrician. So yeah
cosmiicsloth [info] That does sound plausible in my situation since I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I noticed it had started getting a bit worse before the pandemic anyway. I'll have to look into that. Thanks!
ConstipatedUnicorn [info] Can confirm, only place I go to for preventative care is my eye doctor.  And that's just once a year for updated prescriptions.  Only time anyone goes to the doctor around here is if something is already bothering them.  Our healthcare system is a bullshit scam.  But god forbid you mention anything even close to healthcare for everyone and suddenly everyone gets all bent out of shape because "socialism".  It amazes me how thoroughly brainwashed people are to think that what we have is a good system....When I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder several years ago it was due to a 5min ride in an ambulance my college called for me because I nearly fainted from a panic attack.  That ended up costing me 2000k.  I was 20.  What 20yr old college student has that kind of money?  I sure as hell didn't.  It took me nearly 2 years to pay that off.
lostinthedark99 [info] I've had the same thing happento me. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD when I was a teenager. My symptoms increased when I had my son five years ago. I would wake up in the middle of the night literally thinking I was going to die, my heart beating so fast I could barely breathe and it took me about 5 to 10 minutes to calm down but I did. In the five years since his birth I've noticed I haven't had as many episodes it feels as if it's getting better with time. For me the thing that works the best is remembering I'm fine and this is just a panic attack, plus I would go on my phone and watch funny things on you tube to distract my mind. I spent many years on many different medications and seeing psychiatrists and therapists. During these times of uncertainty and fear it definitely increases the severity of any anxiety or panic attack. Stay safe, feel better and we're all in this together.
becausepuppies [info] When I was about 17 my anxiety got really bad seemingly out of nowhere and I struggled really bad, in pretty much the same type of way you described.  Here's the good piece of advice that my mom told me: if you have the capability to think that you're going crazy, you're not going crazy.  People who actually "go crazy" aren't mentally capable of differentiating the way they're acting and what's actually normal.   You thinking you're going crazy is scary, I know because I've thought the same thing many times, but rest assured that it's just anxiety, not something more severe. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety I saw about a zillion different doctors because I just felt "weird" and I knew something was wrong but I couldn't describe it, that was the scariest part.  Once I was finally diagnosed with anxiety, I was able to educate myself and find ways to help myself.I won't lie, I struggled for years, some worse than others.  But my best advice is to educate yourself on anxiety, it's symptoms, and treatments as much as humanly possible and keep advocating yourself.  Don't let people tell you you're being dramatic or it's all in your head, and  most importantly DO NOT BE ASHAMED. You will get better, you will learn to manage the anxiety, and hopefully along the way you'll learn what I did - that more people than you realize struggle with anxiety in some form, and most people are willing to help you out if you just ask. You may have to go through a few therapists who you don't get any help from, but you will eventually find one that works for you.  Also, don't be afraid of medication--it's what really helped me out.  
kd08014 [info] It seems like you‚Äôre in a tough spot. An unfortunate reality is that people without anxiety or depression can struggle to understand what it‚Äôs like to suffer from it. (Par for the course for mental health really.)My advice is that you will probably be better off seeing your GP if your talking about medication. Medication isn‚Äôt the quick and easy fix for anxiety and depression that the public opinion would have you believe. It can help you in coping with it but it‚Äôs not a Solution, it can just help you find one, and it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a long term thing. Take it from me, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was young. I was medicated for almost all of my school years plus some. Nowadays I‚Äôm resistant to most anti depressants and can‚Äôt be medicated for it if it takes a bad turn.The reasons for all the follow ups is so they can make sure that you‚Äôre responding to the drugs correctly, and unfortunately It‚Äôs gas to be face to face to do that. I understand though, I dislike visiting the Dr myself.Of course if you can‚Äôt do it then by all means, don‚Äôt push yourself. Do what you think is best. Having someone you can confide in and vent to, like a friend, can be helpful. It can also be helpful to have a good friend around if you want to confront your parents (that way you don‚Äôt have to do it alone.) I hope you find a way through this.
leratokay [info] Hi everyone... wow i feel home.already üòÄ reading what all you have to say helps to know that one is not alone. I was diagnosed with anxiety a while ago. Ive always known i have it though since I can last remember. Ive always wondered though guys have you ever felt down and not know why? I struggle with that quite a lot hey guys if someone has and know what Iam talking about please let me know what you are doing to get rid of that feeling. Its really really horrible Sometimes feel like just crying and Iam not sure why. Sometimes it comes to me out of the blue whenever wherever I really hate feeling that way because I really do try to get rid of it but dont know how. Sometimes it lasts for hours sometimes the whole day. Sometimes I do know why but most of the time I am not sure why I feel down in the dumps. Isn't there maybe something I could eat or drink that could help get rid of it üòÉ. I would choose physical pain over emotional hey really. At least with physical you can tell where the pain comes from unlike emotional. üòüüôÅ
boredmind79 [info] What you described is exactly my situation for the last 3 years and I've been diagnosed with anxiety by a psychologist, but I can't say for sure that you have it as anxiety might hit different for every person.Just like you, I know what my triggers are and I usually go back to my normal self once I can solve it, or I suffer a lot when I can't. My first experience with anxiety lasted for about a year, than I went 1.5 year anxiety free and now it's back again. My therapist said my anxiety is not constant because only certain situations trigger it and that makes sense to me. I have developed ways to cope with my anxious phases but the only way to "end" it is to solve my problem, no matter how hard it is.
NixyNooNoo [info] My family thought I was anorexic before I was diagnosed with anxiety. Eating was the main thing I worked on with my therapist but anxiety belly is a very real thing you are not alone. I still struggle with it now although not as bad.
suisse1997 [info] They are almost constant though. As soon as I wake up, I think of ways of dying. I get to work. I think about a gun. I go to the bathroom. I think about a gun. I‚Äôm around my family, I think of hurting them. It‚Äôs truly torture. I try to talk to myself and say it‚Äôs just an intrusive thought, you don‚Äôt actually want to. But it seems to keep backfiring. I was diagnosed with anxiety so it makes sense in a way.
Goth_Goat [info] I experience a similar thing but without the visual aspect because I have aphantasia (inhability to form mental imagery, to visualize).I always over think about every situation and try to think about different scenarios and outcomes of situations. Mostly negative scenarios. For example if I have to go out and buy groceries I would imagine a shooting at the store, or that someone steals my bag, that someone dies of a heart attack infront of me and many other things.I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and know that overthinking like that is a symptom of anxiety. So maybe thats what you have?I suggest you to consult someone to help you manage with that because I know it can be very scary and disabling.Hope you get better!
feb90 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and they recommended CBT. I‚Äôm a big one for catastrophising and also assuming other people‚Äôs thoughts about me.
Sandizzle5 [info] I'm not a professional but I know from a patient point of view, it's hard for us to know what might be "normal" and what might qualify as a clinical condition. I admire your courage in realizing something might be off and reaching out. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have had some similar thoughts in terms of wishing things would just end, but I'd never intentionally do anything about it because I wouldn't want to cause my friends and family pain. In my experience anxiety and depression can come and go, they can also be "behind the scenes" types of things that were bottle up on the inside. I also think some try to just hide it or rationalize it away but long term it won't help.If it's at all possible, are there counselors or therapists available at your school?  Those professionals are better equipped to evaluate your particular situation to see if a diagnosis is appropriate, and if so, what treatments are available. Personally I started therapy earlier this year and even my family have noticed improvements in me. I wish you the best of luck whatever you choose, and hope things get better.
cripple2493 [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety and agoraphobia and I find myself unable to leave the house due to anxiety and asking myself if I'm faking it - so yeah
PastaBod [info] Im in a state where its legal for medical use and i share that sentiment. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I dont ever use on the job (personal preference) but i think its wild that i could take the xanax my doctor offered to prescribe me (that i declined bc i have a family history of drug/alcohol addiction) with no occupational pushback yet i could get fired if i did smoke on the job. Lol makes total sense
fl33twoodmacs3xpants [info] I've had many if these tendencies my entire life and never even thought about it. Then I was diagnosed with anxiety at 28 and realized how weird it was.
LostSoul2137 [info] No to panic attacks and I was diagnosed with anxiety on an unrelated issue but I know the feeling of anxiety it‚Äôs like a pressure on my chest and this is not it plus I‚Äôm not anxious about anything when it happens. I could be listening to music or just cooking some food when all of a sudden my lungs forgot their one job
ShylyFrustrating [info] Developed after purchase meaning I can submit for claim is it? I am scared that my employer would know if they know I have a psychiatric condition that may raise red flags haha because i did not declare while signing contract. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder n taking medications for it but it does not affect my work. Should I tell my employer?
Kenners2712 [info] Before I was diagnosed with anxiety I thought I had some kind of recurrent stomach virus.... For a year.... During this period I was given a super low dose of amitriptyline (used to be used as an anti-depressant at high dose) to help with the stomach upset, I take these in the evening - took a week to get used to it but omg it's helped SO much. I also take omeprazole which is an anti-acid, as even though I don't get the pain of acid reflux apparently I still have it (discovered during a gastroscopy). It really helps to calm my stomach and stop the nausea and diarrhea which are the main symptoms of my anxiety. My anxiety causes my stomach to produce a lot of acid which causes the diarrhea and vomiting.From what I've seen on Reddit lots of people are on all kind of meds which I've never heard of, these two I'm on are solely to treat the physical symptoms in my stomach/gut. Hopefully this helps somewhat! :)
SensitiveEase3 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and these anxiety things can really mess with your sleep. I've even had it were my body felt calm but my mind felt tense and I still couldn't sleep, and have lay awake all night with my mind being paranoid. It wasn't so much that I was having racing thoughts but it was I guess a feeling I had, and my subconscious was scared.
TastingTheSun [info] I currently take 2 medications. I take 75mg of Zoloft and I‚Äôm tapering up on Lamictal. I have therapy once a week  since it‚Äôs provided for free through my university . I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder first, then bipolar disorder came into play once I started taking SSRI‚Äôs and it triggered mania. I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder because I‚Äôm too ashamed to talk to my therapist about it.
Thealtruisticpoet [info] Pisces sun, Leo moon, Sag rising.I can cross my legs in a very difficult way that others can‚Äôt, and my feet don‚Äôt have any arches. i am pretty sure I‚Äôll develop some kind of arthritis when I‚Äôm older. I think this is in due to my Pisces sun since Pisces rule the feet.I haven‚Äôt really felt anything going wrong in the aspect of body parts associated with Sagittarius. Leo rules over the heart and spine system... I have been diagnosed with anxiety and i tend to feel emotional pain as a physical pain. I‚Äôm anemic, so i guess my heart isn‚Äôt getting as much oxygen. My posture could definitely use some work.
ammubi [info] When I was 11, I was home alone and a chip got stuck in my throat. I had my first panic attack (tingling hands, shaking, hyperventilating). After that,  I was terrified to eat for fear of choking and I developed severe anxiety. I was in the exact same boat as you, only consuming liquids. When I would try to eat solids, I would chew non-stop and couldn't bring myself to swallow. I remember being so scared to die due to malnutrition, but at the same time I was scared to die from choking. This was one of the toughest times in my life. I went to therapy and was told I couldn't be helped because the therapist thought I had an eating disorder. My family had no idea how to help. I kept hyperventilating and my mom took me to the ER twice (that was when I was diagnosed with anxiety and hyperventilation). I remember riding by a cemetery and imagining my family picking out a casket for my funeral. At people's houses, I would spit my food into a napkin to pretend I was eating or I would hide food and then flush it down the toilet. My anxiety got so bad I could barely ride in a car without getting a panic attack. In all honesty, one day I just had enough. It was like all this strength and bravery just came over me. I ate a hotdog of all things. I didn't chew a thousand times. I just ate normally. I think no matter how much support you have, you are your biggest supporter. You have the power to take control. It's definitely not easy, but if I can get through it, so can you! Take it slow, start with something soft, take small bites, even if it's just a few and then you're done for the day.I believe in you. You've got this. Stay strong and know you are not alone!
Antkn33z [info] I've been pretty open about it with my parents for years. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I'm on medication. I think I'm just going through a rough spot anxiety-wise right now. I'll soldier on through this.
gloomis120 [info] Hey there. I finished 75 Hard a couple weeks ago, and I've been diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) and depression. It definitely helped me in many ways. After about the first week, I noticed that my mind was shifting from the whole "procrastinating and sitting around worrying", to needing to do things right away and not thinking about it. I did however fail after 18 days, and that was a learning experience as well. I dwelled on it, got depressed, and finally picked myself back up and started over. I found the reading to be relaxing and much needed in my daily life now. Overall, i think 75 Hard helps those of us with mental illness because it gives a laid out path with goals. Since completing 75 Hard, I've found it easier to get my tasks done in daily life and instead of feeling like I'm being stagnant in life, I've been very proactive and in control. My confidence has went up as well.If there's anything specific I can answer, feel free to ask.
snail-overlord [info] The way you described it sounds almost identical to how I experience it. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone haha. I have anxiety too but also don't believe mine is anxiety related, just because I was diagnosed with anxiety over ten years ago and never had this happen. My neurologist thought low blood pressure before, so I guess I'll see what he says when I update him.
-whatsername [info] That‚Äôs fair enough. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear about it, though, and I appreciate you were able to tell me. In the interests of full disclosure, and perhaps it will make you feel like you‚Äôre in understanding company, I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2018, and I suspect I have other undiagnosed conditions, too. Those in the subreddit chatroom can vouch for my neuroticism. ;) There‚Äôs nothing worse than fighting these invisible battles in my mind every day. Each birthday, I celebrate making it through another year, rather than being another year older.Anyway, enough about me. If you ever need to reach out during or after those times, I‚Äôm always here. :)
Superfly1980 [info] I gotcha. I used to use self talk myself way too much. Unfortunately it was not good because I would ( this is going to sound crazy ) before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I didn't believe the doctors because my symptoms were so horrible. I self diagnosed myself with schizophrenia. I used self talk to tell myself I was hearing voices when it was me self talking. It's great you use it positive. If you are overthinking....Maybe you can try something to literally make yourself not have that option. If you were to read something. Maybe the first couple times you might not be able to comprehend if the self talk is so much/overthinking. ( Not comprehend I mean pay attention to it ) but if you try to read something about a topic you are interested in, and recite back in your mind what you read about, and make sure you were able to pay attention then it might help you with overthinking. Also you can take quizzes online, find a movie and just rewind if you're overthinking makes it hard to pay attention to. Self talk can be your best friend or your worse nightmare. I do have to say though that this is one of the most interesting topics I have read on here and I say that in the nicest way! ( I should say question I have seen )
Throwawayuser626 [info] Oh this wasn‚Äôt a one day thing, I was diagnosed at 12 and given extensive tests and therapy. I remember filling out all kinds of papers and forms. I also spoke with several therapists. knew I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I don‚Äôt remember ever being told I had ADD.
Susccmmp [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teen which was before the ADHD diagnosis. I have co-morbid disorders, I‚Äôm bipolar II so a lot of what presented itself as depression and anxiety as a teen were symptoms of my bipolar which doesn‚Äôt really present itself until your mid-20‚Äôs in most cases. I‚Äôve seen ADHD specialists and I don‚Äôt really have what gets tossed around as ‚Äúadult ADHD‚Äù but rather I‚Äôm an adult who has ADHD. There are a lot of articles written about how girls are often misdiagnosed or really not even diagnosed ADHD as elementary aged children because of gender norms and coping mechanisms, like being a people pleaser and over compensating by hyper focusing and being a perfectionist. My mom tried to get me diagnosed in school but teachers didn‚Äôt see what she saw, I was well behaved and a good student and they didn‚Äôt know I could watch them and pretend to listen. My mother obviously spent more time with me and saw it in things like how I would start a book before finishing another, I couldn‚Äôt watch TV and only watch TV, I had to be doing another activity. We left it alone because it didn‚Äôt really interfere with everyday life until I was old enough to drive and we wanted to make sure I was being treated properly before getting my license. Then you throw in the bipolar and it really complicates things. Bipolar is often misdiagnosed as ADHD when patients are younger because mania gets brushed off as hyperactivity or restlessness when you‚Äôre young. And since ADHD is treated with stimulants you‚Äôre  really fucking things up because your mood is completely destabilized if you‚Äôre not treating your full mood swings or you‚Äôre not even aware you‚Äôre having them. But a lot of ADHD symptoms are also symptoms of bipolar so it gets murky. But I‚Äôm pretty confident in all my diagnosis‚Äôs and the time line of the symptoms makes sense.
Rham1040 [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have dealt with a lot in life. I didn‚Äôt want to post the serious shit I‚Äôve been through and just wanted to keep it light.
firegirl77 [info] Wow yeah that's like me too, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past but never mentioned OCD and never stuck with counseling. And yes, how sociable I am is exactly like that too
Rivsmama [info] Thanks hun I'm glad your son is getting helpful treatment it makes such a difference. It's been happening since my son was born about 6 years ago and I was just diagnosed with anxiety at first, but I knew it was more than that. Im also a recovering addict (over 7 years clean) and I actually started DBT and therapy for that and got a proper diagnosis of OCD and it has helped so much. I am cautious when it comes to medication because of my history, but therapy has helped some. I still do things like what I said, but I'm not completely incapacitated and afraid to leave my house anymore so its manageable.
Tibbersbear [info] When I was 15 I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My dx was changed to being bipolar at 16. I was living my life as someone with bipolar 2 until I was 23 when a specialized Doctor told me I definitely wasn't bipolar. I had been on so many medications that didn't work and when he gave me my borderline personality disorder dx he got me off my cocktail of meds and I've been on only one since. My life has been so much better since being diagnosed BPD.
heartmyboo [info] I self harmed before I met my bf. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My scars are also covered and I have been clean for a few years now. When I met my bf I told him. I trust him and to me it is important that he knows that side of me. That he knows it could happen again if I ever got bad. Now, I don't think you have to tell him if you don't want to. But honestly, it's good to have someone you can trust with those feelings.
Bigfrostynugs [info] My file is red flagged for alcoholism and honestly it hasn't seemed to affect me much, though I haven't needed pain meds for surgery or anything.When I was diagnosed with anxiety a new doctor freely offered me xanax until I reminded him I was a recovering addict and didn't want benzos.
human2quats [info] Yeeeeep. I actually wound up with a mild mental break when I quit smoking. Like you, I was diagnosed with anxiety, anxiety and a few other things. I had smoked around a half pack a day for many years. When I quit I went from being depressed and anxious to a complete snap into some kind of mental shock. Sleeping 23¬Ω hours a day, constantly wanting one so badly that I had to take Ativan to keep from literally pulling my hair out and had to take a couple weeks off work. Weird thing was, like you, I was fine for the first several days. Until all the nicotine was out of my system. Then as the last left; that's when it all went bad.
annmarieg5 [info] I feel the same. I have allergy induced asthma (during the spring I find it really hard to breathe, or when exercising outside. I have an inhaler and it works fine.) But before I was diagnosed with anxiety I would just be sitting at home on my couch and suddenly it would get hard to breathe. Thought I was having an asthma attack and would get frustrated when my inhaler didn't help. Now I realize its a panic attack (so much better right?! lol) I just have to lay down and try my hardest the breathe in deeply and remind myself im not having an asthma attack and treat myself for the panic attack (talking to someone, breathing exercises, taking my emergency meds). Idk if this helped but yeah...
tryng2figurethsalout [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and avoidance personality disorder. Before they officially diagnosed me as having developmental based PTSD. Not to mention adulthood trauma built on top of it.
Queen0918 [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety
efarley1 [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety, and I've had the same feeling before as well. I think it may just be the relaxing effects of it kicking in. The CBD was from a reputable source, so there wasn't any concern with that.
EyeSeeSeeSee [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks due to death of my parents. Both terminal cancer, traumatic to say the least. Anyway I took up yoga for back issues and my instructor taught me to tap. At first I thought it was stupid but when i would be out I would go to rest room or somewhere alone and tap. My anxiety would spiral all day. Took a few weeks got it down to few times a day at shorter intervals. Then few times a week and so on. It took a few months but the anxiety was in shorter duration. I use to fight it but now I say to self ok, I'm feeling anxious and tap. Within less than 5 minutes I get back to normal. Been about 5 years and sometimes I go months no anxiety or panic. I still tap to stay in practice but it's helped me. Even through cancer diagnosis.
AmIAmazingorWhat [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression by the last psychiatrist I tried and given an SSRI prescription, no more discussions, get out of my office. Yeah, I‚Äôm depressed that I keep losing track of time, showing up late for work, and have nonexistent short term memory. Yeah I‚Äôm anxious that I‚Äôm going to forget to pay rent on time (again) or forget to go off the correct exit to work because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the road but how pretty the clouds are. I‚Äôm living with a 24/7 ‚Äúbusy‚Äù signal in my brain and that can sort of stress someone out a bit.
sunny_thinks [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression after leaving my N situation at home. So far therapy and exercise have been working for me. I do still have days where things feel incredibly overwhelming, but no longer to the point where I'm unable to get out of bed for days at a time or having panic attacks out in public.
Ihateyourstupidmutt [info] I can't speak on OP's behalf, but I can provide insight on my own situation. I previously posted on here about a domestic violence situation as well. I've also found myself in several abusive relationships throughout the course of my life. I had a rough childhood. My parents were alcoholics and negligent, my mother was abusive. I was left in the care of drug addicts and a lot of mornings would find needles laying in the bathroom, burned spoons. I wasn't allowed to make any noise. My father paraded me around like a trophy, because I was good looking. He would force me to sit on his friends laps and would make me dance with randoms like the guy working at the liquor store. People always commented on my appearance and what a good girl I was. I followed every order, never made a sound, never caused a problem, got great grades in school...I was desperate for love and terrified of getting in trouble. I was sexually assaulted for the first time at 8 by one of my parents party friends. My parents would never take me to the doctor, and I was peeing blood. They told me it was my period? It was horrible. Anyway so childhood sucked and as soon as I could I got out of that house. Unfortunately ended up falling in with kids who had it worse than me. I was drinking and doing drugs with them.. met my first bf who I loved with everything I had. He had major issues, but was a really good person. Just broken, which I related to so much because of my past. I felt such empathy for him. The relationship turned toxic and abusive, but I would not leave him. After 4 years we parted ways, and my next relationship had the same dynamic. I ended up in therapy after a suicide attempt. Decided to not date for a long time. Met someone, got married, divorced, ended up in another abusive relationship. I'm out now. I'm on medication and in therapy. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders that stem back from my childhood, compounded by all the trauma I've experienced as an adult. I don't think I'm ever going to be healthy enough to make a good choice in finding a partner, so I'm now planning for life alone. It sucks because all I ever wanted was love and acceptance. I choose people just like my parents because subconsciously that's what I want. I wanted my parents to love me.I advocate strongly for children now. I'm still finding my way, I have to restart my entire life and it seems like it's going at a snail's pace, but i just keep trying. I'm not a stupid person. I'm not a bad person. But the empathy I feel for people who are misunderstood, combined with my childhood scars makes me an absolute magnet for people who manipulate, exploit, and just don't care. If I could flip a switch and be normal i would. It takes a lot of work, and unfortunately you can only learn by living through it.
Aaliyah702 [info] Thank you so much for helping me with this! Here‚Äôs one I guess: I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I have paranoid thoughts (so my view of things can be distorted) and one person once reassured me that people do like me and I‚Äôm told often that ‚ÄòI‚Äôm always in my head about things‚Äô so I should be more trusting of other people‚Äôs views over my own because I have to take my anxiety and paranoia into consideration.
Mattrockj [info] Really neither are any good for me, I was diagnosed with anxiety recently after I had a meltdown in class
chinchillapups [info] That I am diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression. I know that it‚Äôs pretty obvious I have anxiety, and really they should be able to see it , but I don‚Äôt want to burden them . My husband knows and is supportive, and therapy/ meds are going good.
foxes722 [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Finding those labels were not 'self-fulfilling prophecies' - they were a massive relief in that I knew that there was a specific reason I was struggling and they pinpointed exactly what I needed to work on to live the kind of life I wanted to lead. Apparently more than 3.5 million Americans deal with Aspergers, and that's a large enough number that I think we want to think about what we call 'normal'. I find that word to be largely unhelpful and sometimes just insulting. It suggests we measure ourselves against other people and their experiences, and that's not really a useful way to approach how we move through our lives. A) We don't know what other people are struggling with privately, and B) the word 'normal' seems most often used in ways that make people feel shitty about themselves. Ignoring our personal struggles in order to conform to some imagined standard of 'normal' is not realistic or a healthy way of approaching life. Acknowledging our struggles and finding the tools we need to live more fulfilling lives is invaluable. For your ex - acknowledging the issue and talking to people going through the same struggles, understanding what is hard for him/them, and how they've worked around those obstacles, that can be immensely valuable. Having a whole bunch of people who don't understand or empathize with your experience tell you how to do things makes way less sense logically and honestly on an emotional level. This is not something he's going to get over by pretending to be like anyone else. And it's not your job to fix any of this for him... but there's a lot of judgment in the word 'normal' and it suggests that what he is is somehow wrong or bad. I don't think any of us want to feel that way.
throwawaymyusernamer [info] Yeah I feel like this. I have been diagnosed with anxiety most of my life but I recently started seeing a new therapist who says I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed all these years. She diagnosed me with ocd. I‚Äôm always online reading about people with ocd and comparing myself. My therapist actually keeps encouraging me not to keep ‚Äúresearching‚Äù other people online because it‚Äôs a type of reassurance seeking. And the ‚Äúresearch‚Äù itself is compulsion. But a lot of days I‚Äôm still convinced I don‚Äôt have ocd for some reason.
Kehndy12 [info] Hey, I'm diagnosed with anxiety but no longer take medication for it. I've tried smoking weed ~5 times but have never felt anything from it. I've tried edibles a few times and they've always made me anxious. I've discovered that if I take edibles AND drink, the anxiety goes away and I have a great time.I enjoy acid and MDMA ~4 times a year each, and I always take them at festivals. MDMA is easy to take because it turns me into a positive person. I only take fractions of a tab of acid and for me that's enough. Regardless of what I take, I get really anxious waiting for them to kick in, but I know I have a great time once I start feeling the effects.It seems I handle acid best if, when the effects start happening, I lay down with my eyes closed. Then I let my brain wander as it wants and think about whatever goes through my head (usually it's a lot of "why tf did I decide to take acid fuck this"). Eventually I accept it, get myself up, and go to an artist's set and have a great time. It takes effort to get to this point, but it's always been worth it.I'm already aware people with mental problems shouldn't do this stuff, but I'm informed enough to know what I'm doing. Reagent testing *everything* and taking the same batch I've had good experiences with reassures me that everything will be okay.I'm not sure this helps at all, but I felt like sharing
ackthisisamess [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety, however I also find it a bit difficult to understand where the line is between "normal" and not-"normal" anxiety.... I personally see it as a bit nuanced?
soliloquy1985 [info] I started having mental health problems at an early age and gained more due to trauma. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD. Medication and therapy have done absolutely no good either. I have several physical health problems that suck as well.  I've gotten so bad recently that I can barely work anymore. I was recently classified as "medically fragile" by MDHHS and am working at getting on disability but I've been told it could take a year or two.  Meanwhile I'm living with my girlfriend of nearly four years in a dying relationship that I desperately want out of yet lack the ability to leave. I quite literally have nowhere to go.  The only home I have that I could go to is my childhood home, which my mom gave me, that is on the edge of foreclosure due to unpaid taxes I can't afford, and is in a ridiculously poor state of repair.  And that, all that, is only the tip of the iceberg. My life is horrific.
100percentcowboy [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder (lol) I drink lots of water, im gonna try CBD and Phenibut plus magnesium for my next one and im only gonna do 1 tab, if it happens again im done forever I think
lovesadventures32 [info] Hi sorry for not clarifying.... yeah I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I just wondered if this was part of it
WannaSeeTheWorldBurn [info] Go to a doctor and tell them why youre worriex and request a referral to someone who does diagnosis and treatment. Or find a place that does it in your area and make an appointment. Depending on where you live there are different options for behavioral health treatment and diagnosis. I found out because I got super depressed after my first son was born. The post partum wouldnt go away. This became a diagnosis of bipolar disorder then the medications didnt help which led to 2 attempts at permanent solutions. After my second hospitalization I was diagnosed with anxiety and borderline along with my bipolar. Got better help and paid attention to medication interactions and side effects. Started doing research on treatments and got back into school. Just finished my bachelors degree in psychology. 
zebrapaad [info] This seems more like a depression thing but I've been diagnosed with anxiety so I guess I'll just put this here. Lately I've had this incredibly overwhelming feeling that I don't really know how to describe. But basically I feel like nobody can be trusted because nobody gives a fuck about me and fine because I don't give a fuck about them either. It's like a mixture of apathy and extreme loneliness. I've completely withdrawn from my friends and family and refuse to speak with anyone about my feelings, even if they ask if I'm okay.  It takes up a good portion of my thought space.  I know I should see a therapist or something, but for the same reasons, I don't want to.
GoopyDumpy [info] You're not alone x I'll have a thought or something on tv or a game just stick in my head, and I'll be embarrassed and irritated that I can't get it out of my head. I suffered with seasons of OCD through my teens where I would overthink and have to check if something belonged to someone, or if I could be cheating on a test in some way, or if I might have damaged even in the slightest someone else's stuff. I was diagnosed with anxiety last year after having a breakdown, but this was a combination of anxiety and depression. I've spent 4 and a bit months in a psychiatric ward, so if you have any questions or worries about that, don't hesitate to ask. From what you've said, there is no reason for you to go to one. Mainly psychiatric hospital is for people who are at serious risk to themselves or others. I take medication for my anxiety and depression, and it does help x For everything you are going through, I just want to say how incredible and brave and awesome you are to be working and in education and to keep going :) but if you find that you do need time off for whatever reason, im sure your uni's will accomodate it.
Laell-Daeva [info] I have "thought blockages" several times a day.  Before I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression I was certain  I was losing my bloody mind.
hurtstobealive [info] I get the point of this post but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to downplay someone‚Äôs mental illness because you think you have it worse. It‚Äôs kind of like a spectrum, sure everyone has anxiety (as long as you have a nervous system) but everyone‚Äôs is different in terms of strength and in different situations. Social anxiety can also make a person rude or defensive because when ur anxious ur body is literally in defensive mode so I also disagree with your point there. I am diagnosed with anxiety but I knew I had anxiety way before I was ever diagnosed so I don‚Äôt think a diagnoses really matters. I mean it‚Äôs not like doctors really do anything special to diagnose you they just ask you like a few questions. Lots of mentally ill people can‚Äôt afford doctors or even know that they need help.
ariesbabeye [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety also. So that might be the reason for my weird experiences just like your experiences. 
usmcsis [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety the year after I graduated highschool and was put on medication (I forgot what I was put on, due to the fact I only used it for a month, and never went back due to life things) but since then I did a lot of research about CBD and how other people used it, what did they like etc. Now I have used a CBD balm that you apply for sore muscles or can even help with anxiety before I used oil. I have personally had great luck with using CBD oil/gummies for anxiety. I usually will buy the oil at 200mg or so (I currently am using 200mg bottle, at 7mg per serving) I find this mg at just the right amount so I can calm myself down yet still be productive and awake. Yet everyone is has a different reaction to it.  I also use CBD gummies on occasion (to me gummies are more for sleeping or if I want to just watch movies etc) but the mg I have in the gummy form is 360mg at 15mg per serving. Not sure if I like that mg or not yet. If you're looking to try CBD for anxiety I'd definitely recommend using oil first. And of possible pick a flavor something you would like it makes it easier to use, when you use oil if you don't vape it, you let it sit under your tongue for a sec and swallow. The only brand I have used is green garden gold there products are phenomenal. I thought about trying something different but I have success with their products. Hope this helps!
MikeStidham [info] THAT was what led me to go to the doctor in the first place, at which time I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.  Some 20 years after that, my wife decided to seek a divorce.  As bad as those first panic attacks were, going through the divorce was 30 times worse.  I'd get this odd sensation in my chest like I'd just drank boiling water, then a hot flash all over me, then my legs would turn to jelly.  It's the weirdest thing I'd ever experienced.
kay9402 [info] The funny thing is though, he was ALWAYS the most happy bubbly person, we were super close and always always talked about deep shit like that and he never had any mental afflictions, which is ironic because I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression last winter.
Alexvergy [info] I feel like this too. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Before quarantine I was seeing a therapist, but didn‚Äôt get the chance to ask about that :(
muskyranch [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm unsure about accepting meds for it at the moment tbh
Nicksonman [info] Yes, I've been diagnosed with anxiety.
ThrowAwayAccount8237 [info] I skin/scalp pick as well. I also have intrusive thoughts - such as crashing my car, hitting people who are walking closely to the street, or something terrible happening to my sister. I should mention that I have not officially been diagnosed with OCD but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks so I‚Äôm like 99% sure that I have OCD (obsessive/intrusive thoughts that I can‚Äôt control or stop, paranoia. false memories, etc.)I was on Zoloft for anxiety for a very long time and I don‚Äôt think I had those thoughts while I was on it. I‚Äôm thinking about getting back on medication now that I‚Äôm seeing a new psychiatrist.
Dsg1116 [info] I‚Äôm 24 and have a bachelors in psychology. I have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Taken meds and seen counselors. I was diagnosed with anxiety and minor ptsd. I‚Äôve contemplated borderline too but my dr said I had the symptoms and he said  there was not much need for the label. I guess cuz only a few were displayed. He said I was a bit histrionic. Medication didn‚Äôt work well, I dunno what to tell you all. I‚Äôm sounding like a monster.
shutupmyhead [info] I appreciate all your thoughts. These things are exactly why I'm not cut out for a corporate world, which I knew that at a very young age. I did fine in small jobs but I've been almost forced into office work just to get a paycheck. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but that's not my employer's business unless it starts to affect my job which it has. That really sucks the working would is so hard because I am not, but that's ok. I don't belong in it. Maybe I'll end up homeless but idk. I know I'm not dealing with this forever. It's a shame.
Dango223 [info] Ty for writing this, it is very helpful but you got me so confused tho. I was learning about asexuality lately because I think I am somwhere on the spectrum. The think is I hate touch but I love hugs from people I trust. Yes, I am diagnosed with anxiety and I have trust issues. I have no need for any physical contact with others, more I need trust. Because of this I thought of me as a demisexual... I feel like I need to first be romantically attracted enough to somebody to be able to feel sexual attraction..So I would love to have second opinion on this. Do you think my case could be demisexuality or I am wrong? Or I have to first experience some serious relationship to know?
cheesygurl [info] I apologize in advance for grammar and spelling issues I am driving and using voice control to type this message. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since middle school and have been taking medication ever since. I turn 22 next month. That being said I‚Äôve taken Zoloft Lexapro BuSpar Trazodone and a bunch of other medications that I can‚Äôt even remember. When I first got to college I had never drank and called my pharmacist to ask him if I could have a few drinks while taking my meds. I don‚Äôt remember what I was on, but I believe it was just lexapro.  He said yes a couple of drinks should be fine. Well,  I was in college and ended up getting completely plastered. Woke up fine. Even though I had done a lot of online research that said that my medication was not to be used with alcohol I have gotten very drunk very often on my medicine(for the first 1.5 of college, i calmed down after that). I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs good to do nor am I saying that it is healthy to do but I will say that I am alive and well and drink whenever I please regardless of when I‚Äôve taken my medication. In fact I make sure that I have taken my medication when I drink because I don‚Äôt want to get too emotional while drinking. I‚Äôm sure every doctor and therapist would yell me if I ever told them this. All I‚Äôm saying is that I am still alive and have never had any symptoms besides being hungover. I think that the real issue is that it can intensify the effects of of alcohol. Ôøº
GnomeMadness [info] I had the same thing happen to me with the sunlight. As the sun was setting and I was in the shaded area, I felt like I needed to run to catch up with where the light was still shining. Also, the breathing part sounds like minor hyperventilating. I can only say that I was diagnosed with anxiety having experienced what you describe.Don't freak yourself out trying to diagnose yourself with anything further because everyone finds something if they start researching symptoms. It's hard to not think all sorts of things to worry yourself about everything you feel, but do your best not to.  Just talk to your doctor, and if he/she thinks it's anxiety, they will point you in the right direction, probably to a therapist.

Billysbch [info] Back in 2013 I was diagnosed with anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, borderline personality disorder, a rage disorder, and schizoeffective disorders...I am fairly certain that my anxiety disorder is almost completely situational but there is nothing I can do about my current situation just yet... My husband and I are working on it...I am happy that I'm no longer addicted to benzos but I still need some help
kmw920 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression last year. I've had obsessive cough, choking anxiety, obsessive throat clearing (and spitting), and my BMI dropped to 13.5. My elder sister: Don't kill yourself as it'd be like you let the bomb blast and it'd hurt us, the whole family.
xosomeblonde [info] Routine and calming strategies. When I have routines, I am better equipped to handle a small upset. When I don‚Äôt, everything feels very monumental, and I struggle to control my reactions/emotions. I require routines first and foremost. Sleep, food, work, movement, mental stimulation, household stability, etc.. After that, I have a ‚ÄúCoping Plan‚Äù depending on the emotion. Little things I can do to get through it, like color, puzzles, breathing, etc.. ACT was also particularly helpful (it teaches you to accept and acknowledge your emotions, and then simply move on without arguing with them). Game changer for me. Disclaimer, I‚Äôm not ‚Äújust‚Äù emotional, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. 
emerald188 [info] I‚Äôm so glad you feel better , did you feel hopeless at one point in time too ? I‚Äôm will to take night sweats . I was diagnosed with anxiety but i deal with depression and grief as well . Also sometimes horrible intrusive thoughts ) sometimes those can go away and then they‚Äôll come back for several days . It‚Äôs exhausting.
c0gnitivityy [info] I can't exactly relate to your situation but I was diagnosed with anxiety and agoraphobia a couple of years ago. I lost my job working in the deli because I didn't know how to balance my workplace and my professional environment. There were plenty of times where I had to step away into the break room or into the walk in just to take a breather. Not to mention I made the amazing decision to become close and intimate with a co-worker. If I could add my two cents, I would say it sounds more like you need something to relax your mind and Prozac has always been associated with anti depression for me. Perhaps you could mention this with your doctor and talk about alternative suggestions? For me, Klonopin is a lifesaver. If you don't want a benzo, I suggest Hydroxyzine. It also functions as allergy relief as well. I've been through quite the cycle of medication trying to get through my anxiety until I finally found something that fit. My life changes pretty often. In May, I got tboned by a drunk driver to where I broke my socket to my hip, my wrist and 3 ribs. I had to learn to walk all over again and currently am still in physical therapy and it was absolutely hell all summer. My family life hasn't always been the most stable. Are you in a position where you could perhaps pick up smoking? Medical marijuana in a legal state (I'm not even in one myself) but I haven't taken Big Pharma meds in over a year. Good wishes!I'm here to talk!
GoBackToMeddit [info] To supplement my post title:I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder after several trips to the ER for chest pain/discomfort, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating/clamminess, heartburn,and several other heart attack symptoms. Each time, they run blood tests, x-rays, and EKG and find nothing. After the fourth visit in August 2018, I stayed overnight and had a stress test that showed no signs of blockage, so it was written off as anxiety or panic attacks.Since then, I am still always experiencing the symptoms above. Last night, however, I experienced the same symptoms, but these felt distinctly different and more intensified. For example, the heartburn I usually feel is esophageal whereas what I felt last night was a raw burning sensation in the core of my chest cavity, kind of like the lactic acid burn you feel in your arms or legs when trying to get in that last rep of a set of free weights.So it got me thinking about the stress test which, as I understand it, only detect around a 70% blockage. Given my age (41), sedentary lifestyle, alcoholism, obesity (6" and 280 lbs), poor eating habits, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure (tldr: I am a ticking time bomb waiting to go off), it seems theoretically possible that an artery could have been 65% blocked at the time of the test which would have gone undetected. Since it was 7 months ago when I had that stress test, would it be possible to jump from 65% to 70%? What if an artery was 50% clogged?Therefore, I think the real question is this: How long does it take for a clogged artery to increase by a percentage point? I understand that there are a great number of variables that go into such an estimate, but is there a rough estimate?
DONOTTOUCHYOURDICK [info] That‚Äôs a horrible way for a mother to treat her child. There should only be love and compassion for her child. I will say though, one thing, that getting out and doing things like exercise, eating healthier etc really will help you out in the long run. I‚Äôm not just someone who has never dealt with mental issues trying to fix you. I have come out of an intense season of depression and borderline suicide. My parents divorce, one of my best friends died from a car accident, and meanwhile I was single with few friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and filled a prescription. I never took it. I say this to say one thing. I made a decision. A decision to be consistent in my actions. A decision to not equate my circumstances with my personal well being. I decided to not take the meds because I wanted to face this internal demon. So instead of spending a weekend alone playing 15 hours of fortnite, which was normal for me, I would slowly implement things I knew was good for me. THE ABSOLUTE BIGGEST THING IS TO BE CONSISTENT IN THE THING WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO DO. Say after one week of running in the morning every day, you start feeling depressed and you fall back into your normal tendencies. That‚Äôs the absolute worst thing you can do. When you feel like quitting, that‚Äôs because you are doing the right thing. If you aren‚Äôt consistent, you will never get out of the hole you are in. Sounds harsh but that‚Äôs the way it is. Now, I have began to eat healthier, exercise daily, take supplements. Now instead of looking at my problem as an elephant, I look at is as a piece of an elephant that I can take one bite at a time, and move forward. Hope this helps
InTheBinIGo [info] Damn this is controversial! I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but never used it as an excuse. If I did shit on a test in uni, that‚Äôs on me for not studying, not because my mental illnesses stopped my ability to study. There are obviously way bigger extremes like psychosis, insomnia maybe, etc. that really COULD affect someone‚Äôs ability to do certain things though.
FerisProbitatis [info] Ugh! Retail is the worst! I was diagnosed with anxiety after working in retail for a year. Quitting that job to go to school was the best decision I've ever made.I hope you will find the resources and right circumstances to pull you out of that mess. No job is worth your happiness and your life.
bentleyherman [info] Thanks so much. That is great info. Did you ever feel panic during them? Did you ever see a doctor about the auras? I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks but am worried that I‚Äôm experiencing something like a focal seizure.
mdows [info] I absolutely agree with that. But it does drive me absolutely crazy when people say ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù as if it were that easy. But I do agree that people like to throw around words like depression/anxiety/OCD, when in reality they are just temporarily sad about something, a bit nervous or like to keep things in order. I feel like people often forget that just like a physical illness, there is criteria to be actually diagnosed with a mental illness (and yes, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and a panic disorder by a doctor).
dreamerimagine1 [info] Well, I'm an introvert and I hate social life. But you're right about excessive overthinking. In fact, I'm diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I am also very indecisive so you were absolutely right about that. I don't understand what you mean by being protective and poisonous in financial stuff. Do you get anything about my career from my chart? I always sabotage myself and my career. Does my chart say anything about my creative life? I want to be a writer. Thank you.
SunnyG24 [info] My parents had to do multiple rounds of IVF over 10 years and they were already older so now at 21, my parents are 83 and 61 which hits me hard sometimes. Until I was about 17 and I'd gone off to college, I hadn't really thought about it but sophomore year I was diagnosed with anxiety and this was something that came up with my therapist that I hadn't realised had been weighing on me quite a bit. I can't stand the thought of losing them, especially since my Dad at 83 looks like he's in his early 70s. It's dark but I hope I get married soon so he can walk me down the aisle, and even see his grandkids. Advice, like many others are saying, a counselor or therapist might be the healthiest way for him to channel these feelings and thoughts in a positive way. It's helped me a bunch I know. Hope all goes well &lt;3
illustrated--lady [info] It's a huge change, when I first started suffering with anxiety when I was in year 9 (So about 13-14) I had no words to describe how I felt, nobody could help me because I couldn't explained what I was feeling, nobody, not my parents, the school, my GP ever picked it up on what it was. I went from panic to generalised anxiety, namely health anxiety for a few years before panic picked up again and completely took over my life causing me to drop out of university and almost become housebound. It was around this time that I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I was absolutely MORTIFIED. I was terrified of anybody finding out, I felt truly alone and like some freak of nature, nobody ever spoke about mental health, it was so taboo. My only knowledge or experience came from the 'abnormal psychology' I did for my A-level psychology.In the 8 years since then there was seems to have been this complete turn around where discussion of anxiety is everywhere and I understand that everyone feels anxious from time to time. Maybe for a specific reason (an exam for example) or even without a reason but that does not equate to having an anxiety disorder, they are two very different things. I always think of having an anxiety disorder as having that panicky feeling you get before you go to the dentist but having it constantly with no cause, constantly questioning everything around and viewing it as unsafe. It is truly debilitating.
t4mmi [info] It‚Äôs different for everyone, and can manifest differently for individuals at different times so I can only tell you how I experience it. I am diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I am a rational person and I know my ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù are nonsense but something in the back of my mind just overrides all sense. I fret about everything and overanalyse situations thinking of every possible thing that might go wrong. ‚ÄúBut what if...‚Äù is my brain‚Äôs absolute favourite. I catastrophise. Minor things feel much worse than they are. This all causes me to take extreme and irrational precautions against unrealistic threats as well as to avoid ...  a lot.As far as panic attacks... For me, sometimes I feel like I need to hide (at times I literally have) for no good reason or escape. Sometimes I am paralysed with it and just freeze. I cry. Sometimes I have difficulty breathing, my heart races, I have excruciating pain in different parts of my body (usually my neck), pressure in my head, sometimes dizziness. Basically all the things you might imagine being an appropriate reaction to immediate extreme danger with either minimal or no stimulus to justify it. See a therapist, it helps. ETA see a therapist sooner rather than later, I know the money and time is an issue but it is really, really important. I wish I had addressed my anxiety sooner, not doing so led me to habits and thought patterns that made it much worse. 
svkadm253 [info] I notice this too. Especially at work. I'm in IT and outages are no fun - not life threatening danger but people get pretty mad and $$ gets lost. Everyone panics but I'm like OK let's do this. I recently explained to my boss that I was diagnosed with anxiety and he was like 'what, but you're so calm'. Meanwhile 3 hours earlier I had to shut my office door and hide under my desk for a few minutes to try and calm down and nothing actually bad happened.
J_Bravehill [info] Hey,Because of school and an abusive boyfriend I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, panic disorder, PTSD and alot more. It feels like someone took something from me and I just what to feel whole and ok again. I struggle every day to live a normal life.. Nightmares follow me still to this day, and I am very insecure, I don't like the way I look and every thing just hurts sometimes. I can't do certain "normal" things without having a brake down. I'm getting better but still I am far away from being fine anyways I have a long way to go. (if you made it this far ;p) A little bit of my story I'm 19 and I was bullied for most of my school years. It started in 2nd grade when I needed glasses. They were calling me names and stealing, hiding or even braking my glasses. That continued for 3 years.I got into 5th grade and found some new friends.. I was a little chubby and very quiet. Then people started saying to me that I was ugly and fat also my best friends started to ignore me because I wasn't fitting in. I always wanted to be perfect but I could never acive that because they always found something new they could nid pick about. In 7th grade everything got worse I got emotionally abused, I was the one who always had the homework and so they stole my stuff. Summer brake was right around the corner and I thought if they want me to be thinner I can accomplish that... In 6 weeks I got from 65 to 43Kg. And it wasn't getting better. First they were throwing paper and pencils at me, then paper turned into stones and pencils inton chairs and tables.. I was really struggling to explain my injuries and the teacher who saw all that wasn't going to do anything against it. Let's not talk about9th grade because it pretty much continued. You might think "why ist she doing anything against it" or "she could've changed school" "she could have tolled her parents" well yes I could and I did but because no one was seeing how bad it really was. And I thought that I could handle it. I got into a self defending class where I met my abusive boyfriend. I could defend myself but 1 VS. 4 is pretty unfair and i was just starting jiu-jitsu.Long story short as my parents saw what happened to me I was able to finish school at home. I just showed up for exams and our finals. I graduated.My ex abused me for 1.5 years after he forced me into this relationship it took me 2 years until I was able to break up with him.Now I'm on my way to get my dream job and to my 20th birthday and I hope I can feel better by then.If you're still here reading my story, I just want to say I am so grateful that you did! Thank you for listening to some random girl on the internet. I really appreciate it! I am sure you are an amazing person and I would love to here your story to!Have a great Sunday üòä
megatron412 [info] I was just diagnosed with anxiety and I went to cardiologist for the same thing... everything keeps coming back fine. It‚Äôs great that we don‚Äôt have a physical problem, now it‚Äôs how the fuck do we get out of our own heads?
syco54645 [info] Yeah this happens to me while sober. Actually went to the ER for it. They laughed at me. Eventually I was diagnosed with anxiety being the cause. Wasn't great being laughed at over it, I always prefaced it with "I know this is gonna sound nuts but..." So yeah. At least I have it figured out though.
goodvibesmama [info] I hope so I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age 13 but it was on and off kinda things but since 2015 it became an everyday thing I just want feel normal
PriinceV [info] Lol, I came to this subreddit to ask about this. Had unprotected sex 2 weeks ago, now I have night sweats, a runny nose, and a swollen lymph node in groin area and ofc I'm diagnosed with anxiety lol. This post gave me a bit of relief, thanks. Now let me get back to panicing and searching the web.
Younce-Davis [info] Oh gosh! I had that problem with some neighbors a few years ago. The guy would literally beat his wife on the front lawn! Luckily they moved. My neighbor is considered lower middle class‚Äî but it is full of retired folk and starter families. It‚Äôs not a friendly neighborhood since everyone is moving in and out constantly. I was raised by boomers‚Äî the pick yourself up by the bootstraps mentally is still very prevalent in my society. It‚Äôs not realistic. When I was diagnosed with anxiety and had to go on meds it shattered my parents world üò≠. Luckily they are very understanding. I used to make morbid jokes out of situations. My bf is from the Philippines and over there, people who aren‚Äôt optimistic and see the joy in life usually lose hope and don‚Äôt make it. It‚Äôs a poor country so starvation is widespread. After I stopped making morbid jokes, I became more optimistic. That only happened a few months after meds though. It was a rough transition. It‚Äôs good your friends can read you well. Curious, are you a high school or college student? Or working? If you are an adult, that will probably open up more treatment options for you since you won‚Äôt need your parents permission to receive it. If you are an adult, that will also give you the possibility of moving out and into a better environment. Trade school, if you do not have the resources for college, can get you some very nice jobs‚Äî look at welding‚Äî salary of $100,000 USD. 
chick3ns4ndwich [info] I had the same experience starting the job I'm at now. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. After about a month of starting my full-time job, I got super panicked. I felt like I couldn't stay at my job, I was leaving early, I thought very seriously about quitting because I was so anxious and almost bordering suicidal again. It didn't make sense because it's not like I hated my job and I posted to reddit asking if I should quit. I ended up not quitting because a lot of people said that if I like the job and there's nothing wrong there, it's better to try to stay. My boss was super understanding and we worked out an agreement where I can leave work early.  The job took an adjustment period but after that I feel a bit more stable in my work place (especially with the support of the people I work with) and I think pushing myself helped a lot. I would wait to talk to your boss before you decide, sometimes you have more options than quit or stay. Ultimately, though, do what's best for you and your health. I think it's a good decision to take some days off.
nyx1047 [info] I have to make a decision to go back to med school or get a commercial pilot license and do that as a career. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I am having a hard time deciding.Med school is a high stress environment, and I don't know if I would have another relapse with it. Specializing in Opthalmology would help the family business though.Going to pilot school is expensive and I don't know the chances of being employed after. However, from what I've heard, the returns are also high and travelling might help compensate work related stress.
thesweetbabyg [info] That I was diagnosed with anxiety several months ago
HollyGeee [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at age 17. Went to a pcp til 18 when I went to college, then went to a therapist for a year. Next year I did psychiatrist  and therapy then stopped both until just this last year. At 22 I started going back to the psychiatrist only.It really depends on how you're feeling and coping. I've had no problem going when I need it and not the rest of the time. If its time for you to go back to therapy I say go for it, it's always a great experience. 
loisurcarison [info] Everyone in my family suffers from what is called "compassion fatigue" and it's basically just not being able to care anymore. After my suicide attempt I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and PTSD from some of the stuff that I've gone through. My sister and brother (on different unrelated occasions) have attempted to kill me, which contributed to my anxiety and of course, my PTSD. I become extremely sociopathic when I am in one of my depressive episodes, I don't have the ability to feel empathy or care about anything. Its kinda a drag I must admit.
apiaries [info] Exciting to see all of these new farms popping up! I haven‚Äôt been able to try a more ‚Äúpremium‚Äù CBD product and I would love to evaluate what a quality product does for me. I am diagnosed with anxiety due to some complex traumas and even low dose CBD helps with it, along with some chronic physical pain that I have from a wrist surgery and Lyme Disease hip injury (which I start PT for tomorrow!). It also helps settle things if my GERD kicks in. CBD allows me to stand for shifts at work, something that is agonizing if not impossible without, along with being able to enjoy my day. I‚Äôm not interested in opioids or pharmaceutical muscle relaxers, the former because of the side effects and ridiculous abuse potential and the latter because they don‚Äôt work for me. As far as anxiety goes, I would say that being able to control my disordered eating (binging) changed my entire life... I lost weight, am in less pain because I am now a healthy weight, feel more confident about my body, and am just living a healthier and better life. I‚Äôd love to try your product! I‚Äôm starting my senior year as a Mass Communication student in one week and I‚Äôm curious to see how my semester could be improved with less anxiety and more focus!
elrabb22 [info] Yes in the past definitely. It got pretty bad again a few weeks ago. I experimented with visualization to see what it looked like that was disturbing my morning. I settled on a heart meditation and could visually ‚Äúsee‚Äù all of these attacks and negative thoughts that were just below the surface. So each day I imagined calling it dish and tending to my invisible wounds. After one month I woke up without any stress or anxiety. It took quite a bit of work I don‚Äôt want to lie to you. Full disclosure I have been diagnosed with anxiety in the past and used to suffer full blown panic attacks. I really hope this helps, feel free to dm me.
FHRITP69er [info] Understood. Just looking for your POV. You have experience so your opinion is worth something, but rest assured, I'm not diagnosing myself.I had gotten these "zaps" a few times during a shroom session, but nothing ever came of it. But I also wasn't diagnosed or had symptoms of anxiety at that time. I'm diagnosed with anxiety now, but that was after a sports injury and was also a very active marijuana user. Never had any anxiety issues using weed until the injury.
InnerMattDemons [info] Contrast:I have been diagnosed with anxiety for around 11 years by now. I've been working on managing it for all those 11 years, with mixed effect.I know I'm "wrong" - in that I'm unable to do a lot of things that should be simple. I hate myself for this. Truly, deep down inside hate myself, for being unable to do so many basic things. I don't want to bother people, so when it's bad I have a really hard time reaching out. I just isolate myself and feel lonely, wishing I could get away from the constant bombardment of thoughts about how awful I am, and how many things I cannot do.So, I'm working on trying to accept myself more. Not hate myself for my flaws and limitations. Not hit myself in the head with all the simple things I cannot get myself to do.Stuff isn't always easy to fix. God knows I'd love to not feel this way; I go to weekly therapy, have listened to innumerable audiobooks, lectures, YouTube videos, ... about it.I'd love to be able to fix it that easily. I haven't managed in 11 years.So, I'm sorry for trying to embrace it and not hate myself for once. No one wants to feel this way, and it isn't always easy to fix.---More constructively: If you see someone who is clearly holding themself in a destructive or dysfunctional pattern, perhaps they don't know how to break it. Perhaps they just don't know how to do it in a better way. Perhaps they get overwhelmed by trying to change it. There can be a myriad of reasons.Rather than look down on them for not fixing it, you might consider talking to them about it. Perhaps even offer to help them with it. That way lies progress; not in judging someone for the things they have a hard time with.
hibecca [info] Not a doctor.. had very similar problems and I was diagnosed with anxiety. Didn‚Äôt believe it at first, and my problems got much worse. Thought i had an inner ear disorder, brain tumor, etc. When I did finally accept it months after diagnoses, things are getting a lot better (therapy and medication to help).
mschellbell [info] Wow! You sound exactly like me 10 years ago. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression as a teenager, and I am also an introvert. I, too, knew I wanted to work in a profession in which I would be helping others.I considered pyschology but couldn't see myself as a psychologist and didn't have a clear vision for my path beyond getting that degree. I shadowed an OT for a few hours to get a better idea of the job and felt the goals/values of the profession matched my own. I was really scared when I finally decided to take the leap and apply to the program, but with the encouragement/support of family, friends, and my therapist as well as medication to help manage my depression and anxiety, I'm really glad I did. I won't say the journey has been easy, but it's certainly been rewarding! The program and the profession have challenged my depression, anxiety, and introversion every step of the way. I've experienced many highs and lows this past decade, but I've grown so much as an OT and as a person...and I wouldn't trade it!I would just like to say that if you're genuinely unsure if the profession fits your style (I.e. creativity vs structure, workload, environment, etc), I encourage you to shadow an OT or talk to a few OTs maybe in different settings (informational interviews) to better determine if it's a career you would enjoy. If, however, your primary concern is the effect of depression, anxiety, and introversion on pursuing this career, then I say you have as much to offer as any other prospective OT! It's an opportunity to face challenges, grow personally and professionally, and realize what your capable of...because it's a whole lot more than you may think! OP please feel free to PM me :)
petitsamours [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. But I just looked up the symptoms for ADHD and they describe me to a T. I'll make sure to bring this up with a therapist once the covid craziness calms down. Thank you.
I_think_I_forgot [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 21, and ADD when I was 26. It's a weird experience for sure. 
Perversia_Rayne [info] Definitely talk to your doctor about your medication and see if you can be referred to psychological services (I'm not sure how it works in Ireland exactly as I'm UK based).My experience is that, at 18, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have had various antidepressants and talking therapies since (I'm 34 now). When someone who knows me well suggested I look up BPD, it was like an epithany, as I think I fit around 7 or 8 of the 9 diagnostic criteria. What I had never realised was that some of my behaviour wasn't normal, even though I'd felt it was, as I knew no different, thus I'd never talked about it to a doctor or therapist. I'm still waiting for a formal diagnosis on the NHS but reading other people's stories and being able to relate has helped me a lot, whilst I wait for a possible DBT referral.The diagnostic criteria do overlap with that of other mental health issues and it's often why they struggle to diagnose people. Only a qualified professional can say for sure but there is no harm in reading about BPD and seeing if there is anything you can do to help in the meantime. There isn't any medications specifically to treat BPD though, that I'm aware of.
deplorablewhitey [info] No, but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and you just triggered it
IndividualSchedule [info] Good point. I wish people would recognize it more and don‚Äôt potentially and maybe unintentionally normalize social anxiety. Me being introvert, I was diagnosed with anxiety and symptoms of social phobia years ago (along some other mental illnesses).Now I really struggle to recognize if it‚Äôs me being introverted or me being symptomatic. And it‚Äôs so hard to live like this. Sometimes I know when it‚Äôs symptoms of social anxiety and when it‚Äôs being introverted.And I really wish more people with potential social anxiety would rather seek help than just say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm introvert, I‚Äôd rather stay alone.‚Äù it just deepens the social anxiety. In both cases it‚Äôs important to get out of our comfort zone, get nice doze of social interaction and then recharge and do it again. Of course social interactions with rather positive energy.
InsaneIzzyTheFirst [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but no way on earth is this related. It was so offending. She took one look at my medical history and assumed it was because of my anxiety. I can understand if someone was having episodes of increased heart rate, or stomach aches, but I've never heard of anyone having tingling,numbness and bad balance because of anxiety. It doesn't make sense to me. It's so frustrating :(
_hipster_dog_ [info] I know a lot of kids my age who would never even think about leaving the gospel no matter what information was given to them. They have came to believe that it is all lies and the church is the only truth. Many of them are in my AP classes too. I think one of the things that helped me is being on the debate team. That really puts to test finding the truth. However people dont need debatw to find the truth. They simply just have to look for it wherever it is. Jr high was rough. I went to a chartee school k-8 and finally had to go to a different school to get away from it all. I have been finding things to believe in and follow but its really difficult. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression so some days it is hard to want to do anything. I was supposed to get a counselor back in march but my parents havent bothered...
Daesastrous [info] Maybe bring her in to a doctor's appointment so she can hear the diagnosis for herself? I know my mom is sympathetic to my stuff because I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 10 and she was in the room. It is a little awkward to answer questions about whether or not you're suicidal in front of your mom, but it's undeniable evidence.
lustforwine [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and they said not adhd, but my testing showed adhd from neuropsychologist
anonbff [info] I went to therapy. I learned that behavior can be a symptom of anxiety, which I didn‚Äôt know I had. Therapy taught me a lot more about myself. Like how to spot when it‚Äôs just me having a moment and what to do. After I was diagnosed with anxiety I went to my doctor and started taking Zoloft which was the best thing I‚Äôve ever done. The change started at the root of the problem, the relationship. Though we loved each other very much, I knew I had no. There was no way for me to move on and grow from my old habits. I needed a clean slate. My next relationship was leaps and bounds better. We are both in a good place of mind, which makes our relationship all the better. 
prider90 [info] I' m in the same boat mate. :( I've been diagnosed with anxiety.  Tried lots of supplements/meditation and no improvement.  Somehow I always remember music lyrics or gaming competition tasks/challenges but I forget simple things and having a hard time to remember things people told me.&amp;#x200B;
handwritten_emojis [info] Yes, I was diagnosed with anxiety in 6th grade (age 11)
Mei_me [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety and depersonalization/derealization (emotional numbness, brain fog, detached from reality, very bad memory to name a few).Apart from that: being unable to make friends, depressed, very litle trust in people, afraid that everyone hates me.
brittybat [info] I feel like this a lot. I feel really calm most of the time, but I'm also at home most of the time, and not much makes me anxious when I'm at home in my comfy bed. But I've been diagnosed with anxiety by two doctors (just my regular primary care doctors) when I went in for unrelated issues and put on medication for anxiety.Also my boyfriend seems to think my anxiety isn't that bad for me to be on medication for it. But also I feel the most relaxed when I'm with him and he's never really seen me in the situations I get anxious in. But does make me second guess myself, my diagnoses, wonder if the doctors are just pushing medications.
goater10 [info] Not sure if this applied to anyone else but before I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, id have to consciously think how I would normally respond to my friends and colleagues if I was my regular self and force myself to act how I would respond normally. After finding the will to get out of bed, act "normal" for 8 hrs and then crash mentally and emotionally at home for what felt like a 1000 years, I knew I had to get help.
Treeseconds [info] That description seems like me but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and social anxiety? 
foliefortuna [info] I was never diagnosed with depression but I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I became antinatalist from browsing  after sustaining permanent damage around my face in an accident. 
indistars [info] Thank you so much for this. I‚Äôm definitely going to try joining a club maybe. I did try therapy (I was diagnosed with anxiety) and I got super comfortable with my therapist but she moved away and I haven‚Äôt been able to find one that I can just start over with. I am going to be moving away to a whole new country but I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be too anxious the whole time. 
frcrobert [info] I'm really starting to feel that, especially since 2 years ago when I was diagnosed with anxiety.
ChocolateFixesAll [info] My kids are on an age group swim team and have been for several years now. That meant I was sitting and watching them during practice 3+ times a week (now 4 as they've gotten older) for an hour and a half each practice. Even visiting with other moms my hands were twitchy. I focus better if I'm doing things with my hands. I had started making "crochet" items with rainbowloom bands and it was fun but after a year or so the bands would dry out and break and then the kids wouldn't have the cute item anymore so I decided to make REAL crochet with yarn that wouldn't dry out. I spent a year just doing lengths of the different basic stitches, SC, DHC and DC and frogging them over and over. Made scarves for both the kids that are horrible since I didn't know about edges or anything at the time, made a doll blanket for my daughter's My Life doll. &amp;#x200B;I discovered that I really REALLY liked crochet. I could visit while I was doing things and my fingers weren't going nuts. About this time is when I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression so DOING things became even more important. I got a yarn bag as a christmas present from my inlaws and a gorgeous wooden yarn bowl. I fell in love with doing amigurumi and spent 4 months making seahorses and octopi to sell at the kids Home Meet. Sold all of them! It was very validating so I just kept on. I love that it's something I can do at swim meets since it's usually an all day affair for those, I watch HGTV and movies at home while crocheting, and it's something I can take pride in. &amp;#x200B;I grew up in a crafty family. My mom was the head of the craft committee for yeeaaarrrssss and we always had tables in craft shows. My stuff was always ... meh. I was a kid. they were cute, but not great. When I was an adult and married I tried making wax tarts for tart warmers, which were fun but hubby can't handle how overpowering the scent is when I'm making them so I stopped. crochet works much better. LOL When hubby's at work I also make bathbombs for the kids since by the time he's back they are sealed and the smell isn't strong anymore.
Eth3realFox [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past, i know it is and I'm still going to a therapist for it. It's just that nothing has changed, no matter how hard I try to work against my own nature. I will always be a stupid loser in real life, no matter how much i try to hide it online
UncleDoj [info] Hey there. Also a 26 year old guy. I was just diagnosed with anxiety and CPTSD. I'm going to be discussing BPD with my psychiatrist because it perfectly fits my thinking and emotional patterns.Anyway weird figuring this shit out halfway through your 20s eh? 
kindnesswillkillyou [info] Thank you so much for posing this. It makes me feel so much less alone. I have been a skin picker for as long as I remember. When I was small, around 4 or 5, I picked a huge hole in my scalp.. not sure what started it, but I was a very anxious child. Unfortunately my mother shamed me for it, and of course I couldn't stop the behavior, so I hid it and felt a lot of shame and guilt. Now, in my late 30's, I still pick my scalp and pretty much anywhere on my body that I can. Especially where this hair .. so pubic area, even around my nipples (gasp! I know) and also on my face. I have scars and scabs and they make me feel terrible which I assume is a reflection of how I feel about myself. I don't know how else to put it, but it feels good.. like a release when I pick. And it is very compulsive... sometimes I don't even notice I am doing it. Like many of you have mentioned, I will run my fingers all over myself looking for a spot to pick. I am diagnosed with anxiety (generalized plus some OCD) as well as depression and am currently in intense psychotherapy which is bringing up some memories that are pointing to some traumatic events in my childhood. I don't think I will ever know for sure what the cause is. Anyways, thanks again. I appreciate you posting this.
PhasmaUrbomach [info] Same. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, and I'm almost 50. I only have two streaks of grey at the temples. At this rate, I will still have dark hair by 60. My dad also had dark hair until he was quite old. So I think it's a lot to do with genetics. If stress were the primary factor, I'm sure I'd have a head of greys.
Dewmsdayxx [info] I had my first (and so far only) colonoscopy at 20. To make a long story short, I dealt with severe constipation from the moment I was born until this procedure. Prep was fine. It wasn't until I was in the gown, in bed, when I started to freak out a little bit. By dad and boyfriend (now husband!) were in the waiting room. Nurses kept walking by me, giving me weird looks, before sending them both back to me. First words out of boyfriends mouth, "are you cold? Are you OK?!". Apparently my lips were blue. Nurses came back and gave me 3 heating blankets. Wouldn't take me back for procedure until my temperature regulated again. Crazy thing is, I didn't feel cold..?About a year after the fact I was diagnosed with anxiety. So. There's that.
smolbeanlydia [info] Just fyi if this is for Psych I‚Äôm assuming this is about how social media impacts your mental health, so I think it should take into consideration people with already diagnosed conditions. I was diagnosed with anxiety wayyyyy before I found social media but in your data it could be used as a point that social media use and anxiety levels correlate when my disorder has nothing to do with it. Just want you to be aware people with previously diagnosed conditions may skew the results. 
kelseylynne90 [info] Has he looked into IBS? I had issues similar before I was diagnosed with anxiety at 17 (I‚Äôm almost 29 now) and my stomach is still wonky as hell. 
shibaewie [info] I didn't properly understand why I was hypersensitive until I was diagnosed with anxiety. As far as I and everybody else was concerned, I was just a crybaby who couldn't handle life. It's been quite the journey trying to come terms with such situations
Qeltar_ [info] &gt; But is it though? Yes, it is. I have a relative who nearly flunked out of college and had to take an extra year. He had to start at the bottom in his mid-20s and eventually became president of his company. A former boss of mine, nicest guy you would ever meet, didn't get married until he was 40. My former best friend got married over 50 after a string of failed relationships, including a cancelled engagement.I know of a number of people who started new careers in their 50s.Everyone is different. There is literally no surer path to misery than comparing yourself to others or to artificial standards set by "society."And also remember that many people are starting careers and families later in life these days compared to earlier generations.&gt; I feel like I will not be able to outdo my parents, and that makes me feel awful.Exactly. It makes you feel awful. The problem is not you, however, it is the idea that you need to outdo your parents.Trust me, I know this well. I let it make me miserable for decades. Every time you have a setback or something doesn't work, you feel bad. And then you compound it with guilt and disappointment over not living up to something completely artificial.I make less money than my father. Want a kicker? I make less than one of my **kids**, despite being in the same general field and having a lot more experience. How about that? And yeah, I won't lie to you and say it didn't make me feel like a failure at times. But you know what? I'm happy for him, and more than that, **I'm not him.** I'm me, and I do the best I can. Oh, and "success" as defined by Western society isn't "all that" either.Once you let go of all of this poison and let yourself just be you, you'll find that doors open that you never even saw before.&gt; I'm ambivalent about the ontology of "mental health" as described by doctors, psychs, the DSM, etc. On the one hand, lots of people correspond to mental illness descriptions and there does feel like there's something wrong with me. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression by a psychiatrist and a counselor in the past. On the other hand, it feels like a convenient cash generator for big pharma and an excuse generator for me. "Oh, I'm depressed, that's why my life feels so awful." Maybe I'm depressed because I'm awful and so is my life, shit.And maybe you feel awful and so is your life because you are depressed?I resisted getting help for years and years. It is natural. But when you need help, you need help. And when you decide that the only option left is to end it, you need help.Being diagnosed with depression doesn't mean you can just make excuses. It's the exact opposite. It's hard work to figure out what's going on and hard work to get better. "I have depression" is less of an excuse for things than "I'm awful." Because "I have depression" doesn't mean you just wallow, it means you recognize a problem and work on fixing it. &gt; I used to go to therapy like two years ago. I've been considering going back, albeit to a new counselor. I feel like I hit a wall with my old one.That's common. Finding a good fit with a therapist can be hard, and sometimes they run out of the ability to help. I encourage you to find a new one and give it another try.&gt; Thank you for your kindness and understanding. It helps. I hope you have a good day.My pleasure.Please don't sell yourself short. Anyone who uses the word "ontology" and expresses themselves as well as you do is intelligent and thoughtful enough to find something they enjoy and gives them meaning in life.
Knasha1127 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression at the beginning of this year. For about the past year before I had been struggling emotionally. I was put onto antidepressants around Jan 2019, and everything seemed to be okay besides that fact that was still a bit anxious. I meet with my doc again in feb, tell her I‚Äôm still experiencing some problems, she ups the dose to 20 mg. After this everything seemed to be great, but now after being on the higher dose for almost 3 months, i seem to be feeling even worse. It feels as though my emotions are a roller coaster. I have an appt with my doc coming up here soon where I plan to share all of this. I guess I just wanted to post on here to see if anyone has gone through something like this and been diagnosed with bipolar later. After reading about bipolar disorder I don‚Äôt feel like I have it but I am also not sure bc I do have some symptoms   - as really only a professional will know. Just looking for advice or any words anyone would like to share.
celesteshine [info] My parents are the best. When my siblings and I were children our family wasn‚Äôt very well of financially. But, we were never poor of their affection and attention. We had great childhoods. They always listen to my problems and help me work through them. My Dad sacrificed so that I could go to uni. He helped me pay to do an extra course to boost my qualifications. I honestly don‚Äôt think I would have made it through university without my family. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 1.5 years ago. My Mum came with me to the doctors, held my hand, cried with me, listened to me and checks in to see how I‚Äôm going (much better). We aren‚Äôt perfect but I am extremely blessed. 
solojones1138 [info] I thought I had a TIA once and my roommate had to call 911 for an ambulance. Turned out to just be a random panic attack (this was before I was diagnosed with anxiety). But my face was numb and I couldn't speak properly, so it was definitely scary.
nja1998 [info] Yes. I was diagnosed with anxiety and given medication but the idea of actually taking the medication made my anxiety worse bc i thought i would get addicted to it or i would have some weird reaction or side effect. So i tried more natural things. Herbs like certain teas etc which helped a little. But what helped the most was physical exercise. I started lifting weights and working out and slowly the anxiety just went away. I'm still a pretty nervous person who over thinks everything but i haven't had any panic attacks
bambola21 [info] I have not been diagnosed with BPD. But at the VA my marriage counselor said it was important to bring up to my therapist and psychiatrist. I know now I have many traits of BPD. I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD. I have quit many jobs because of the overwhelming feeling I get (which causes me more anxiety) however I have had jobs that have made my mental health worse. I am currently not working due to this issue. It‚Äôs like you get so overwhelmed and being a slight perfectionist I see myself as a failure. That just brings more anxiety and depression into the mix. It‚Äôs tough Op. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs easy. Try and do what you can, the best you can each day at a time. I was very successful throughout my career making 6 figures. But the pressure I put on myself seems to lead to self sabotage. I know it‚Äôs hard. I hope you can continue successfully. Do you have a current therapist? 
guildmaster3 [info] Hello there! I just wanted to say that I‚Äôm going through the same thing. I have been diagnosed with anxiety for about two years now and the forgetting words just happened recently. I can‚Äôt keep a steady conversation verbally, and it takes a whole lot of time trying to find the right words. Although I have found that when my anxiety decreases, finding words becomes easier. I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but just keep working with your therapist. I haven‚Äôt found a solution, but maybe you will. I hope things get better for you :)
notsoimportant1010 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 9 or so. This year I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs been very bad. I‚Äôve had just anxiousness all the time and I had my first BAD panic attack yesterday. 
HikariYumemi [info] I don't think I want to throw them away because I don't have many friends in the first place, but I want to put some distance between us for sure.And yes, I went to therapy for a short time, my psychologist said that I was simply growing out of things. To be honest I think I'm simply fed up from being told that I matter to people and them not being there for me when I need them too. I'm tired of the lack of reciprocity. (Btw I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression)
HeadbangsToGojira [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders for years even though I could never actually pinpoint anything making me anxious.When I finally hit on the ADHD thing and brought it up, I was hardly even second-guessed after explaining what I was struggling with.So I'm not saying you have ADHD, but because of the constant struggles and screw-ups and failures that come packaged with it and the symptom overlap, anxiety and depression are both likely to be where most professionals go initially with their diagnosis. Diagnoses of anxiety and depression are very common to be co-morbid with ADHD as well, so it's worth bringing up the possibility if you can see a see a doctor about it.
KarebearMom [info] I never played doctor like this as a child.Please take my comment with a grain (or more like a jar) of salt because I am diagnosed with anxiety, see a therapist for it, and take medication for it.My children have known from as young as I can remember that no one is allowed to touch their private parts. If my child said another child touched them, I would at the very least be putting in a call to the Pedi to get reassurance that this is normal. I may be overacting, but like I said, I have an anxiety disorder, and I tend to be self-described basket case (sorry if that offends anyone with anxiety - not my intention at all). Regardless of what the Pedi said, I would notify the parent of the friend what your daughter told you in a very non-accusatory way. While your child may not have been molested, the other parent's child may have been by someone. You just never know, and it's always better to be safe than sorry in my opinion.
drinkallthecoffee [info] Depression is very common with narcolepsy. When my narcolepsy gets really bad, I get really depressed. Looking back, much of my serious depression during adolescence may have been due to depression. I'll go over the most effective treatment options, and if you're interested, I'll go into each of them more deeply and provide my personal experience with each of them.The thing, though, is that it doesn't really matter why you're depressed. The treatment for depression is the same whether it is a reaction to something in your life, such as narcolepsy, or if it is for no reason at all. If it lasts more than two weeks, you should go see a mental health professional. There are three broad treatments for depression that are currently supported by the literature.1. Therapy (usually cognitive behavioral therapy, but any talk therapy should help)2. Exercise (20-30 minutes a day, 3-5 days a week)3. Medication (SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers; off-label: modafinil)**Note:** Before I continue, I'd like to point out that I am sharing my understanding of the psychological literature and my personal experience on depression. This  should not be considered medical advice. Although I have a PhD in psychology, I'm not a clinical psychologist or an MD, and of course you cannot be diagnosed or treated by a stranger over the internet. That being said, my summary of treatment options in the literature specifically comes from reading meta-analyses on treatment options and from taking a graduate biopsychology course taught by a neurooscientist who specialized in stress who addressed this issue during lecture. My degree was in cognitive psychology, but I took an interest in clinical psychology, and for a couple years I taught a unit in undergraduate psychology on psychological disorders and treatment.There are three takeaways that I hope you can get from this. The first is that you are not alone and that this is very common. The second is that there are three recognized treatments for depression. The third is that you should discuss these options with a mental health or medical professional.# TherapySeeing a therapist is considered an essential part of effectively treating depression. Also, I would say that narcolepsy puts so much stress into our lives that anyone diagnosed with narcolepsy could benefit from some therapy to deal with the emotional and social stressors of having a permanent neurological disorder and invisible illness.I was originally referred for therapy to address my sleep hygiene. Obviously narcolepsy and IH are not caused by problems with sleep hygiene, but people with N and IH both have a harder time maintaining proper sleep hygiene than the general population. Improving sleep hygiene was really helpful for me. I had tried for years to improve my sleep hygiene on my own to no avail, but keeping a sleep log and problem solving with a therapist helped me get back on track. At this point, my therapist has decided that we probably don't need to talk about sleep very much, but I will be staying in therapy because I found it very helpful. I was severely depressed this year, especially before I started my modafinil, and going to therapy once a week has been really helpful. Currently I have been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD in addition to my depression. I go once a week for individual therapy, but I will be going a second time for group therapy for my anxiety starting this week.#¬†ExerciseThe [Mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495) recommends: &gt; Doing 30 minutes or more of exercise a day for three to five days a week may significantly improve depression or anxiety symptoms. But smaller amounts of physical activity ‚Äî as little as 10 to 15 minutes at a time ‚Äî may make a difference. It may take less time exercising to improve your mood when you do more-vigorous activities, such as running or bicycling.I started exercising at least 30 minutes a day for 3 days a week last year to treat autonomic nervous system dysfunction, but it was really helpful for my depression. After a couple months it just went away. A friend of mine joined me at the gym because he was seriously depressed as well, and it worked for him, too. I became really depressed this year again, and so I started going to the gym 5-6 days a week once I started taking modafinil. My depression improved significantly, and by the time I started up therapy again, my depression was almost in remission. I also found that improving my diet in conjunction with exercise was very beneficial.The literature supports that exercise can be just as effective as other treatment options in reducing symptoms. The literature also shows that it may be functioning through the same mechanism as taking an SSRI. That is, by increasing neurogenesis. One issue is that it's hard to sustain for anyone, especially if you're depressed and chronically ill. The other big issue is that it doesn't address the root causes of depression, which for you is likely that you have an incurable neurological disorder that has significantly and permanently changed your quality of life. My personal opinion (and not medical advice) is that although it may work to reduce or eliminate depression, it is unwise to rely on it as the only treatment option, and that one should choose at least 2 out of the 3 options. I personally chose to do exercise and therapy, but ended up on medication to treat my cataplexy.# MedicationsMedications [can be controversial](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/the-science-and-history-of-treating-depression.html), but they are often the front line of depression treatment, especially when being treated by a primary care physician. This decision should be made with your doctor, but as I said before, I come from a school of thought that recommends medication being supplemented with therapy for depression.There is evidence that treatment with an SSRI may be effective in treating people with depression [even without therapy](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/855773). My bias, however, is supported by the findings that 23% of patients being treated by their physician with antidepressants have a [relapse within two years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0087089/). This is further supported by findings from a meta-analysis that shows combining therapy with medication is more effective than [either treatment alone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918025/).Personally, I decided that I would trust my doctors and therapist regarding taking antidepressants or other medications. I started taking modafinil for my daytime sleepiness, but I found that it significantly boosted my mood. This was probably because it's depressing if you have no energy to do anything, but also it helped me go to the gym consistently even if I barely got any sleep. Paradoxically, I have also been sleeping much better on modafinil than I have since I was a child.Later, my neurologist recommended I take an SNRI to treat my cataplexy and suppress my REM to prevent sleep attacks. I found that it had an almost immediate affect on my mood, and that my sleep attacks have been significantly reduced from debilitating bouts of nausea and dizziness to mild yawn attacks that pass relatively quickly. At lower doses my cataplexy was reduced to several small attacks a couple time a day, but at the higher dose, my cataplexy is almost completely reduced. I haven't had any noticeable cataplexy in a week or two, but I also have been experiencing reduced stress, which is a major trigger for me.This increase in my mood probably comes from a combination of factors. The first is that reducing my sleep attacks has helped me be more productive, which makes me feel better about myself. Related to this, I now have enough energy to start a new job working remotely, which has reduced my stress significantly. The second factor is that for my body the SNRI interacts with modafinil and caffeine to increase my mood and my energy, to the point where I was almost manic for the first couple days. The third factor is that the SNRI is probably working to help me regulate my anxiety and depressed mood, acting as an antidepressant, although at first the drug did increase my anxiety significantly. I can admit that I'm surprised at how well the SNRI has helped. I was very skeptical, and I was very disappointed that my neurologist decided to start with an SNRI instead of Xyrem. Although it's still on the table, he preferred to start with a simpler drug and move our way up to Xyrem. I expected it might do something for my cataplexy, but I didn't think it was going to reduce my sleep attacks or affect my depression and anxiety. I believe that a big part of why it has been so helpful is that in addition to the SNRI, I am improving my sleep hygiene, going to therapy every week, running 5 miles a day, and trying to eliminate life stressors. All of these changes were implemented before I started the SNRI, so I can be relatively certain how it affected my mood independent of everything else.
Emz_1997 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression for 3 years and once I mentioned to my mental health mentor that I'd had my symptoms all my life, I have trouble with emotional regulation and my brother has ADHD it suddenly clicked to her that I may have ADHD. I thought I couldn't have it because I wasn't very hyperactive as a child, I just daydreamed, couldn't concentrate and always fell behind and I thought it was my fault. I remember when I was 8, being shouted at by my teacher and mother at the same time because I couldn't concentrate. I was constantly told 'you're so smart but you just won't focus'. I broke down in tears because I was trying so hard to focus but was still getting shouted at. Now I'm in university and still having these issues and if it weren't for my mental health mentor I think I never would have clicked on to the idea I could have ADHD. I'm having a full ADHD test next week to confirm so I am hoping things will get better after that ü§û. 
-partlycloudy- [info] Tips for decaf coffee? (Eg is a latte nicer than capp etc). I quit coffee cold turkey about 18 months ago when I was diagnosed with anxiety and the last thing I needed was caffeine. Now really missing just the taste of coffee, rather than the buzz.
HumectantMenace [info] I am so sorry you are going through this. It is so extremely commendable that you continue to have faith in God while going through this. If you read the parable if the sower- it is the seed that withstands trials that multiplys tenfold.           This could happen to any single one of us. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression myself. Do you have a history of anxiety? Family history? Or did this come out of nowhere.           Nothing happens unless God allows it to be this way. Also know- that 99% of suicide survivors regret there decision the millisecond they let go of life. Do not let the enemy tell you LIES! They are LIES!!           Medically- have you been to see a therapist. I am talking about a therapist who does cognitive behavioral therapy that you can see at least once or twice a week for a whole year or longer?          Any drugs are made to work together with the chemistry of your brain and if you are anxious- you are pumping adrenaline all day long- which can do a lot to your body. You need to have tools to cope with these traumas along with meds as docter is perscribing.           Please direct message me and i can help further!  
tossawayforeasons [info] You're probably not 'addicted" in the strictest terms, but you're starting a habit that doesn't have a good end-point.Right now it's Friday nights, what about in a few years time when you don't need to sneak it? Or when life stress gets worse? How many excuses are you going to find to keep doing something you know is bad for you?And I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and can tell you in no uncertain terms, drinking to fix those problems is jumping in a river to avoid the rain. It will really screw your life up, it's just such a damn hard drug with more side-effects than most others, one of which is it makes your anxiety much, much worse, until you have to drink every day to keep feeling normal.My mother died from drinking two years ago.My brother died from drinking a year ago.My father died from drinking this year.They all had depression and anxiety-like symptoms and became deeply addicted to alcohol until their bodies couldn't take it anymore and they emotionally checked out and stopped caring what they were doing to themselves.It might make you not feel like killing yourself at the moment, but it is still a slow suicide.You're way young to be starting these kinds of habits, your brain hasn't even had the chance to full develop, so taking anything can cost you a lot later on. Have you talked to your doctor about medication and something that might help you sleep and relax? It's not going to feel as pleasant as the warm buzz of booze but you won't regret it later.
overcometogether [info] I also got diagnosed with panic disorder. I was getting many anxiety attacks in a week so I was prescribed Zoloft 50mg, I haven‚Äôt taken it though.  For five days I get good until tonight thoughWhen I even felt de realization I thought that is is a  symptoms of anxiety nothing more. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of derealization though. Try chamomile tea, breathing with your belly,  showering, writing in a journal, talking to someone about what your going through, call a friend, message if you want to talk. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I have been diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder. 
vo1cesinmyhead [info] I'm currently attending group DBT therapy for eating disorders (bulimia and binge eating) on NHS. I think you need to speak to your GP and really emphasise that bingeing causes you a great deal of distress and interferes with your daily life. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 8 years ago but never mentioned eating disorders (I had it since I was 13 or so. First bulimia but at the moment it's just binge eating). If your GP refuses to help, look for another one. You definetely have right to get an appropriate treatment. BED is no joke. Beat website has some information, like you can print out info leaflet for your GP if they have no experience with eating disorders. Good luck. You can get help, but you need to be persistent. I was just lucky lol
fmiacovo12 [info] Hey I just want to let you know that my anxiety worsened and Zoloft caused me severe depression and no stop crying. I was diagnosed with anxiety only. I stuck with zoloft and kept increasing the dose and it went away after 2 months and very slowly got even better. Stick with it if you can and keep increasing. pm of you have any questions! 
that1girl01 [info] Also, goes without saying that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and obsessive thinking.
thepizzadeliveryguy [info] I've questioned whether I have it. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD, and ADHD. The depression and anxiety are all over the place though and sometimes I feel really fucking great so idk. I think I used to have more symptoms of bipolar a few years ago. It's the see-sawing of my mental state that makes me wonder about it.
morgntaylor425 [info] Maybe you have some symptoms from each, which don't add up to an "official disorder" but that doesn't mean it doesn't add up to nothing. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression which are obvious, but I also have a few symptoms listed on BPD that really negative affect my life. I also struggle with the obsession part of OCD, but not the compulsion. So I get what its like to not be in one of their boxes, but still obviously have SOMETHING. So I just think of my situation of a rare disorder that didn't get a name because not enough people have the same cluster of symptoms together. It legitimizes the extent of my mental pain, for me, even if it doesn't for doctors or parents.
alexCDG [info] I‚Äôm 14 and I live in the most remote area you can imagine. There is literally nothing to do in this place except walk around aimlessly which makes me feel pretty depressed. Also, I have no friends, listen to music that other people consider weird, my parents always seem disappointed in me, I‚Äôm fat, and I feel like shit all the time. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I feel like I have autism because I show all the symptoms. I go to therapy but I have crippling social anxiety so I‚Äôm too scared to email my therapist, so I haven‚Äôt gone in months. Everything just kinda sucks.
gigalene [info] I thought it made sense when I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at the doctor's.  My mom had high standards for me but would also make me feel like a failure and that I was lazy whenever I was anything less than perfect. I didn't understand why people handled life much better than I did. I really didn't. I didn't get how they had so much motivation for life. So it made sense. My lowest point was not being able to get out of bed and doing poorly in school because I couldn't get the motivation. Also being with friends and a boyfriend I wasn't happy with. I also worried my loved ones when I didn't come home one night and to work the next morning because I was burnt out and couldn't be bothered to let anyone know where I was. They thought I was kidnapped and filed a missing person's report. I was also close to not being accepted to colleges as a transfer. My highest point was getting straight As at a prestigious engineering school that I finally transferred to and having a close group of friends, after cutting out the toxic people in my life. I joined clubs, got accepted for an engineering project, met more people, got hired for a tutoring job, etc. I try to be more kind to myself. I'm not sure how to treat this to be honest. I'm nervous to go to counseling because what if they don't understand. I try to tell my friends but it comes off like they just think I'm lazy too, because they don't understand why some things are difficult for me. They try to understand and are accepting of it, but it's hard when they don't know how to relate. I figure I'll continue trying for a positive mindset and staying on top of things. I'll try connecting with the community on here too. I let it get the best of me this quarter and I'm burnt out. 
Bad_Wulph [info] TL;DR I have the symptoms, I'm your age, and I've had an extensive cardiac workup. Every test came back well and I'm healthy. My symptoms are caused by a combination of scoliosis and anxiety. You're probably okay, but if you have any doubt, see a general practitioner.Hey man, I'm 22, male, 5'5", 120 lbs, white, with no known medical conditions. I have chest pains and dizziness very often. As I'm typing this, I feel discomfort in my chest and I'm a little dizzy. Take this with a grain of salt, as we may not be quite the same, but I was diagnosed with anxiety, and I've had an extensive cardiac workup. I've have bloodwork, xrays, multiple EKGs, two ultrasounds, a stress test, a 24 hour monitor, and a 30 day monitor. This has spanned across two different cardiologists, my family doctor, and a couple of ER visits. Everything came back perfect. They even went as far to say that my heart seems relatively fit, the complete opposite of unhealthy. The diagnosis I got was sinus tachycardia, which is not a problem with the heart itself, but my brain is telling my heart to speed up and act funny. They attributed that to me being a hypochondriac, which is indicative of anxiety. And they were right, I'm fine, but suffer from panic attacks frequently. If your cardiologists say your heart is healthy, they are probably right. Heart disease is usually decades in the making, and without a preexisting heart condition, it's almost impossible for you to have enough arterial plaque to cause a heart attack at your age, even if you did abuse your body as a teen. And as someone else said, if this has been going on a while and you aren't dead, it's probably not heart related.One reason for my chest pain is I have scoliosis (which was shown during one of my xrays), and it causes tension in my ribs, which pushes and pulls against the connective tissues holding my ribs to my sternum. That's why I have left-side chest pain, and it often causes me severe anxiety. Scoliosis and anxiety work in tandem to keep me worried about my health. I think you should see a general practitioner at this point, as they can likely determine if your pain is cardiac or musculoskeletal, and refer you to any needed specialists from there. 
jonshipman [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression first. When I looked at the official diagnosis, I thought - I don't feel depressed. Day 1 taking Zoloft blew my mind. Food tasted better, I had a better sense of touch, and my happiness practically doubled. I never considered myself sad - but depression is not saddness! it's just a lowered mood - like a fog over your entire life.If it's always been there, you can live your whole life not knowing it's there.
unic0rnamz [info] Yeah! I was in exactly the same position! In primary school I was very clever and actually got the grades expected for how clever I was, but the in secondary school my grades went lower and lower and I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, so the idea of ADHD was hidden. I definitely agree knowing has helped me actually understand the process of my brain more! Thank you for sharing ü•∞
CPledger [info] I have this problem a lot. Convinced myself for a decade that it was just expedient to be faster before all the symptoms piled up and I was diagnosed with anxiety. Funny how we can convince ourselves to gloss over things and justify them as normal. Odd thing is walking slow now makes me anxious.
cltimmy [info] So I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression- unspecified type.  And I am codependent, I hate that I am but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm good enough to do anything for myself so doing things for others is my only motivation.  I appreciate all your feedback and won‚Äôt be self diagnosing of course but it‚Äôs nice to talk to others about it. I‚Äôm also in a super weird situation where I live with one of my old friends girlfriends, they‚Äôre still together but me and him have grown apart since he‚Äôs been ‚Äúgone‚Äù and her family and friends (friends I‚Äôm not 100%) have told me that we are really good together and would rather us be together but it won‚Äôt ever happen she‚Äôs head over heels for this guy so it makes me feel even more of less value and worth. Sorry if I‚Äôm dumping on to much but a lot of you have seemed very helpful 
Horny_Hipst3r [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, struggled with it for years, took antidepressants. I sometimes still have smaller bouts of anxiety or depression but I wouldn't say it is something I struggle with anymore.It sounds strange, but what helped me so much was finding videos about mindfulness and meditation, such as Eckhart Tolle videos on Youtube. Finding out about mindfulness was one of the best things to improve my mental well-being - it taught me that my emotions aren't unique or special, and human suffering is an universal experience. These days when I feel down, I can lift myself up again thinking that these feelings have been felt by thousands upon thousands of people before me, in the same time by people somewhere in the world, and will be felt by people in the future.Don't take my descriptions for it, this is just what I took from it, but it may be off. I encourage you to look up mindfulness videos on Youtube and forge your own interpretation of their contents.If anyone wants to ask about this kinda stuff, feel free to reply or PM me. I am not a religious guy by any means, and I am not one even right now, but this stuff seriously helped me a lot and I'll be more than happy to guide anyone else on this path which has helped me so much to effectively deal with depression and anxiety :)
lumib [info] YTA. You're using anxiety as an excuse for your abusive behaviour.I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teenager. I've been dealing with it for over 15 years at this point. MENTAL ILLNESS DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN ASSHOLE. YOU ARE JUST AN ASSHOLE. Maybe, you're an asshole suffering from anxiety. Yes, all people's illness manifests itself differently. Never have I ever felt the need to abuse and control an SO.
parrushes [info] Hi, I'm Stevie, 27F. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 5 years ago. I've been through a few real rough patches, and I'm going through one now. Taking medication for it though and I'm on leave from work.Anyway if anyone wants someone to talk to or ask advice from you can always send me a message. I'm not really good at giving advice but I know for a fact that it's always good to let it out sometimes
Miiaevia [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety and I can say that CBDs help with that immensely. I can't even describe how much. I hate Xanax and almost never want to take it, so having a safer alternative when I need to calm down is huge. While I'm not diagnosed as autistic, I have immediate family members on the spectrum, so i learned a lot of my socialization skills (or lack thereof) from people with autism. Not sure if/how that plays into my anxiety but I can definitely relate to having strong emotions, the way you described. It's definitely a struggle. Don't be hard on yourself when other people judge you, be proud of yourself for navigating through this everyday and taking care of yourself. It's not easy.
P_Gizmo [info] For what it's worth, I have all the exact same symptoms as you (I'm 29), and just last week I had another round of extensive blood tests performed and I found out that I am extremely vitamin d deficient! Since 2012 I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, OCD, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, insomnia, ibs... the list goes on and on. Now it seems as though most if not all of my symptoms for the past 7 years might have been an easily fixable vitamin deficiency all along. I highly recommend you get a blood test done, even though many doctors seem to wave it off! I had to pay out of pocket for the vitamin d test, but I am so glad I did - knowing what I know now, my whole lifestyle might change for the better! Good luck :)
mollysdollys [info] When I was diagnosed with anxiety last year.It was all downhill from there. (Somewhat literally- I weighed a healthy 120 when I was diagnosed and now I‚Äôm 98 pounds)
rowrowyothrowaway [info] Yes. Go to the doctor. Or maybe even better, go to a therapist. You *do not* have to live this way. Medical professionals can help you understand what's going on in your body and give you coping methods. That doesn't mean they'll *cure* it, but they can absolutely help. I would recommend *not* talking to your parents about it until you know what to talk to them about. Lots of times, if you say "I feel worried all the time," people will tell you to just not worry. They don't mean to be hurtful, but it is! It will be better if you can go to them and tell them what you need to be well. Say, "I was diagnosed with anxiety. Here's what that means. Here's what makes me worried, if anything. Here's how you can help me." 
Alhabor [info] For me, I was assumed to be doing well because my grades were *okay‚Äî* I bounced between roughly a 2.7 and 3.3 through high school. Getting those grades took me literally three times as many hours of work as my NT classmates, minimum. I was constantly sleep deprived and constantly stressed. That is *NOT* doing well, but that‚Äôs how it was interpreted. I also was generally decent at paying attention in class, or faking it long enough to seem more engaged than my classmates; my teachers generally liked me, and made allowances for me to get work in late for partial credit. It was very normal for me to have a C, D, or F for most of the semester and then turn in a ton of work at the last minute and scrape a B once I had some adrenaline in the system. In college, my grades were also generally okay. I test well and learn quickly when I‚Äôm engaged (in general, I had a much easier time with the crosslisted 400/600 level classes than the 100s); the more conventionally difficult classes also tended to have less busy work, or have the grade made almost entirely of tests. Even those that did have a lot of assignments tended to keep them brief (eg. 10 math problems 3x weekly instead of the 30 4x weekly of high school ‚Äî they took the same amount of time per problem, but I had time remaining for other classes when I finished). College professors have less pressure to collect an assignment every day, and that‚Äôs a big help for me. But basically all my assignments and studying happened at the last minute, which means a lot of things did not get into my long term memory. I generally got Ds and Fs in at least one class per semester; My final GPA is decent because the classes the suited my brain were As, and re-taken classes don‚Äôt count against you. But I was definitely on academic probation for several semesters. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and a probable adrenal disorder before I finished, but not ADHD. Getting diagnosed in high school, middle school, or elementary would have saved me a HUGE amount of money and stress. It would have helped me understand why my brain works the way it does. It would have helped me develop more effective coping strategies, and find those that other people with ADHD had invented. (For the record, 50% of points in the US is a fail. A-C, usually 100-70%, is a pass. D, usually 60-69%, is often technically a pass, but in some schools, particularly university, you‚Äôll be required to improve the grade before you can progress to be next level of that class).
Hanekawa3 [info] Aah this really puts it into perspective for me! I was confused because I also get anxious when socializing but it's because I want to get back to my thoughts, not because I'm shy or any other avoidant traits. So that's why I was diagnosed with anxiety and SPD, but not AvPD.Thank you so much, this really nailed it for me! 
TheWalkingDeadBeat [info] My sophomore year of college was the hardest year for me. I was having a ridiculously hard time getting myself to write papers for my English class and I didn't understand because I've always done really well in English.  I thought it was just really bad depression.  I remember hitting rock bottom one night when i had an assignment due the next day that should have been incredibly easy (just a couple paragraphs summarizing a reading)  and for some reason I just could not do it. I remember staring at the computer screen for hours and actually started seriously contemplating suicide all because of one damn assignment. Luckily,  I made it out of that night without doing anything stupid and about a week later I went to the doctor to try and get a higher dosage of my depression medicine and that's when I was diagnosed with anxiety. It hasn't been completely smooth sailing since then,  but once I had a better understanding of what was going on,  I was able to accept it and start to move forward. Here's hoping things get easier for you too. When im really struggling to do assignments or other tasks, I try and remind myself that it doesn't need to be perfect or even all that good-- and when that doesn't work just remember that it's not the end of the world if it doesn't get done.
sohowsthatcrypto [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I think for me it is anxiety that makes tasks feel monstrous.
chelseacd7 [info] Yea I'm like this too. I'm 23 and hadn't gone to the doc since my parents made me when I was in highschool. Until last year. About last August I freaked out and I could feel pressure in my chest and could tell my heart was racing and I thought I was having a freaking heart attack. I was so torn because the idea of going to the doctor made me sick and I thought I might be overreacting  but I kept worrying something might really be wrong. After a night of laying awake thinking I might die I forced myself to go and after an ekg, chest x-rays, &amp; lab work I was diagnosed with anxiety. Go figure. I do think it has improved a small amount though because I've had a few follow up appointments since all that happened and I feel like they were a little easier to handle. That could just be because of the doctor though, she's great and I feel more comfortable with her. I would suggest maybe asking around to people you know to get suggestions for a good doc. I think finding someone that makes you feel more comfortable, even if it's just slightly, could help.
Queefalockhart [info] I was brushed off as a little girl in the 2000's. It seems like girls with ADHD is getting more attention lately, though I feel you with the math thing, I've struggled so heavily all my life but on my recent calculus exam I got a 77% and I was *so*  stoked and proud of myself haha. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression before being diagnosed with ADHD. I hope you're feeling better now! 
curlypaliglow [info] I didn‚Äôt really, at least not on my own. Even though I was miserable and showed all the classic symptoms of depression and anxiety, I needed my partner‚Äôs support to get help. He had to practically make me find a therapist both when I was diagnosed with depression, and two years later when I was diagnosed with anxiety. Both times I told my therapists that they were wasting their time with me because I didn‚Äôt have mental illnesses, I was just lazy/ungrateful/unmotivated/selfish, etc. and that there were people with actual illnesses that needed their help. 
Angrylion1012 [info] It depends on you and your healing process. Sometimes I'll think I am okay...the nightmares stop for months...and out of nowhere, something very minor can trigger a whole onslaught. :/ I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, eating disorder and insomnia because of my past traumas. :/ It's a struggle. Everyone says, "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger...", but sometimes I wish my abuser did and just got the suffering over with. 
Goth_Goat [info] I experience a similar thing but without the visual aspect because I have aphantasia (inhability to form mental imagery, to visualize).I always over think about every situation and try to think about different scenarios and outcomes of situations. Mostly negative scenarios. For example if I have to go out and buy groceries I would imagine a shooting at the store, or that someone steals my bag, that someone dies of a heart attack infront of me and many other things.I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and know that overthinking like that is a symptom of anxiety. So maybe thats what you have?I suggest you to consult someone to help you manage with that because I know it can be very scary and disabling.Hope you get better!
boredmind79 [info] What you described is exactly my situation for the last 3 years and I've been diagnosed with anxiety by a psychologist, but I can't say for sure that you have it as anxiety might hit different for every person.Just like you, I know what my triggers are and I usually go back to my normal self once I can solve it, or I suffer a lot when I can't. My first experience with anxiety lasted for about a year, than I went 1.5 year anxiety free and now it's back again. My therapist said my anxiety is not constant because only certain situations trigger it and that makes sense to me. I have developed ways to cope with my anxious phases but the only way to "end" it is to solve my problem, no matter how hard it is.
StrivinForJoy [info] Yes, anxiety can manifest in various ways, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with your lungs or heart, that‚Äôs just health anxiety creeping up on you.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder in late January of this year.  Like you I had never any mental health issues before that, and suddenly I developed panic attacks one random morning. My panic attacks and anxiety was mainly all physical symptoms.  It went from a single panic attack that lasted 5-10 minutes, to long rolling panic attacks that lasted 5-6 hours.  This was physical anxiety symptoms like  heart racing, trouble swallowing, trouble breathing or taking a deep breath, arm and leg numbness, dizziness, stomach cramping,  vertigo, lightheadedness which led to mental exhaustion and fatigue after it was over.  After it kept getting worse and worse, I ended up getting on low dose Zoloft SSRI medication.  Since I‚Äôve been on it (11 weeks now), I haven‚Äôt had any major panic attacks like before, but I still tend to get physical anxiety symptoms time to time.  Some of it, I think is caused more by the medication than anything.  I‚Äôm trying to get off of it, because I hate the side effects, but I want figure out a plan first because you can‚Äôt stop abruptly. Which medication are you on? And how long?  Sorry your parents don‚Äôt believe in mental health issues.  Everything your saying is classic anxiety and panic disorder symptoms.   Message me if you want to talk more about it. Hope you feel better!
leratokay [info] Hi everyone... wow i feel home.already üòÄ reading what all you have to say helps to know that one is not alone. I was diagnosed with anxiety a while ago. Ive always known i have it though since I can last remember. Ive always wondered though guys have you ever felt down and not know why? I struggle with that quite a lot hey guys if someone has and know what Iam talking about please let me know what you are doing to get rid of that feeling. Its really really horrible Sometimes feel like just crying and Iam not sure why. Sometimes it comes to me out of the blue whenever wherever I really hate feeling that way because I really do try to get rid of it but dont know how. Sometimes it lasts for hours sometimes the whole day. Sometimes I do know why but most of the time I am not sure why I feel down in the dumps. Isn't there maybe something I could eat or drink that could help get rid of it üòÉ. I would choose physical pain over emotional hey really. At least with physical you can tell where the pain comes from unlike emotional. üòüüôÅ
DONOTTOUCHYOURDICK [info] That‚Äôs a horrible way for a mother to treat her child. There should only be love and compassion for her child. I will say though, one thing, that getting out and doing things like exercise, eating healthier etc really will help you out in the long run. I‚Äôm not just someone who has never dealt with mental issues trying to fix you. I have come out of an intense season of depression and borderline suicide. My parents divorce, one of my best friends died from a car accident, and meanwhile I was single with few friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and filled a prescription. I never took it. I say this to say one thing. I made a decision. A decision to be consistent in my actions. A decision to not equate my circumstances with my personal well being. I decided to not take the meds because I wanted to face this internal demon. So instead of spending a weekend alone playing 15 hours of fortnite, which was normal for me, I would slowly implement things I knew was good for me. THE ABSOLUTE BIGGEST THING IS TO BE CONSISTENT IN THE THING WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO DO. Say after one week of running in the morning every day, you start feeling depressed and you fall back into your normal tendencies. That‚Äôs the absolute worst thing you can do. When you feel like quitting, that‚Äôs because you are doing the right thing. If you aren‚Äôt consistent, you will never get out of the hole you are in. Sounds harsh but that‚Äôs the way it is. Now, I have began to eat healthier, exercise daily, take supplements. Now instead of looking at my problem as an elephant, I look at is as a piece of an elephant that I can take one bite at a time, and move forward. Hope this helps
SensitiveEase3 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and these anxiety things can really mess with your sleep. I've even had it were my body felt calm but my mind felt tense and I still couldn't sleep, and have lay awake all night with my mind being paranoid. It wasn't so much that I was having racing thoughts but it was I guess a feeling I had, and my subconscious was scared.
kd08014 [info] It seems like you‚Äôre in a tough spot. An unfortunate reality is that people without anxiety or depression can struggle to understand what it‚Äôs like to suffer from it. (Par for the course for mental health really.)My advice is that you will probably be better off seeing your GP if your talking about medication. Medication isn‚Äôt the quick and easy fix for anxiety and depression that the public opinion would have you believe. It can help you in coping with it but it‚Äôs not a Solution, it can just help you find one, and it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a long term thing. Take it from me, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was young. I was medicated for almost all of my school years plus some. Nowadays I‚Äôm resistant to most anti depressants and can‚Äôt be medicated for it if it takes a bad turn.The reasons for all the follow ups is so they can make sure that you‚Äôre responding to the drugs correctly, and unfortunately It‚Äôs gas to be face to face to do that. I understand though, I dislike visiting the Dr myself.Of course if you can‚Äôt do it then by all means, don‚Äôt push yourself. Do what you think is best. Having someone you can confide in and vent to, like a friend, can be helpful. It can also be helpful to have a good friend around if you want to confront your parents (that way you don‚Äôt have to do it alone.) I hope you find a way through this.
bambola21 [info] I have not been diagnosed with BPD. But at the VA my marriage counselor said it was important to bring up to my therapist and psychiatrist. I know now I have many traits of BPD. I am diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD. I have quit many jobs because of the overwhelming feeling I get (which causes me more anxiety) however I have had jobs that have made my mental health worse. I am currently not working due to this issue. It‚Äôs like you get so overwhelmed and being a slight perfectionist I see myself as a failure. That just brings more anxiety and depression into the mix. It‚Äôs tough Op. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs easy. Try and do what you can, the best you can each day at a time. I was very successful throughout my career making 6 figures. But the pressure I put on myself seems to lead to self sabotage. I know it‚Äôs hard. I hope you can continue successfully. Do you have a current therapist? 
Hexomin [info] If you think you may have anxiety or depression, you should definitely tell your doctor, because you probably do have them. The only person who can say for sure if anxiety and/or depression symptoms are affecting you negatively in your day to day life is you. Both are common conditions that frequently coexist with ADHD. Stimulants can definitely worsen anxiety in many people.Generally in medicine, for people with multiple disorders, it makes sense to treat the most serious condition/the condition having the greatest impact on your life first. If your ADHD is well controlled now, it definitely makes sense to try to get your anxiety and depression under control too.I take vyvanse for ADHD, as well as zoloft and abilify for anxiety. I was diagnosed with anxiety years before I was diagnosed with ADHD, because, without treatment, my anxiety was debilitating, while my ADHD was relatively mild. In fact, my psychologist initially didn't feel confident making the ADHD diagnosis because she wasn't sure if my inattention and hyperactivity was actually ADHD or just a consequence of untreated anxiety. Only after medication got my anxiety under control was I diagnosed with ADHD, because my inattention did not improve at all.Personally, I found that when I started on vyvanse, my anxiety did increase significantly for a few days, then it gradually decreased. In fact, it's not lower than it was before, though this is likely because much of my anxiety manifested as compulsively checking things over and over again, to make sure I wasn't forgetting things, leaving things on, not locking doors, etc. While my anxiety was irrational, it wasn't completely unfounded, since, because of untreated ADHD, I was significantly more forgetful than the average person. After I adjusted to vyvanse, I found I was much less scatterbrained. So I didn't need to double and triple check things.The good news is that anxiety and depression are highly treatable. Your doctor will likely recommend an antidepressant and/or psychotherapy. Despite the name, antidepressants are effective for both depression and anxiety. Psychotherapy is also effective for both conditions. Combined, the two treatments work better than either alone. I've been on antidepressants for several years now, and have had two rather intensive courses of cognitive behavioural therapy, and am doing much better now than I ever have been before.
workin4aberken [info] Hey friend. Writing to say **I am WITH YOU**. During 1L, I experienced two traumatic losses. One, a friend and one was one of my best friends, in addition to other BS that happened (mass shooting in home town, massive fire in my town almost burned down my house, best friend committed suicide). 2L fall I got massive double pneumonia, and fourth semester (this semester) my cousin died from cancer unexpectedly. And now the virus. UGHSo, without rehashing all the bullshit I've faced, I'm here to tell you I understand. And I am with you. I feel like a lot of times, where I excel substantially in writing and my internships and externships, law school just feels like it's not the place for me. In that no matter what, I rarely get average or better grades.Part of this may be because I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and acute stress disorder (not all at once) during 1L. and that's okay. Because I have come to value my mental health more than my law school grades. And I value my family and my time with them more than a grade, especially after I've lost so many people unexpectedly. Keep believing in yourself. Write out your thoughts so you can let go of them. Try to find some mental health support, such as a therapist, and find natural ways to boost your serotonin and get your blood pumping. You can do this.I mean this with my whole heart- you will get through this. And you will learn so much about what you need to be the best version of yourself. To me, that can be more valuable than As (personally, not professionally maybe?). **I mean this too- I am here for you and am happy to talk as much as you need and want. You are not alone.**
lostinthedark99 [info] I've had the same thing happento me. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and OCD when I was a teenager. My symptoms increased when I had my son five years ago. I would wake up in the middle of the night literally thinking I was going to die, my heart beating so fast I could barely breathe and it took me about 5 to 10 minutes to calm down but I did. In the five years since his birth I've noticed I haven't had as many episodes it feels as if it's getting better with time. For me the thing that works the best is remembering I'm fine and this is just a panic attack, plus I would go on my phone and watch funny things on you tube to distract my mind. I spent many years on many different medications and seeing psychiatrists and therapists. During these times of uncertainty and fear it definitely increases the severity of any anxiety or panic attack. Stay safe, feel better and we're all in this together.
cosmiicsloth [info] That does sound plausible in my situation since I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I noticed it had started getting a bit worse before the pandemic anyway. I'll have to look into that. Thanks!
CardioPumps [info] Not sure if they count as antidepressants but I have been taking SSRI pills since 2-3 weeks and they work fine. I am the same me, only a bit more relaxed and my mind is on ease. Nothing BIG happened though, it is not a magical pill obviously.My psychologist prescribed them since I was diagnosed with anxiety.
Thealtruisticpoet [info] Pisces sun, Leo moon, Sag rising.I can cross my legs in a very difficult way that others can‚Äôt, and my feet don‚Äôt have any arches. i am pretty sure I‚Äôll develop some kind of arthritis when I‚Äôm older. I think this is in due to my Pisces sun since Pisces rule the feet.I haven‚Äôt really felt anything going wrong in the aspect of body parts associated with Sagittarius. Leo rules over the heart and spine system... I have been diagnosed with anxiety and i tend to feel emotional pain as a physical pain. I‚Äôm anemic, so i guess my heart isn‚Äôt getting as much oxygen. My posture could definitely use some work.
suisse1997 [info] They are almost constant though. As soon as I wake up, I think of ways of dying. I get to work. I think about a gun. I go to the bathroom. I think about a gun. I‚Äôm around my family, I think of hurting them. It‚Äôs truly torture. I try to talk to myself and say it‚Äôs just an intrusive thought, you don‚Äôt actually want to. But it seems to keep backfiring. I was diagnosed with anxiety so it makes sense in a way.
Sandizzle5 [info] I'm not a professional but I know from a patient point of view, it's hard for us to know what might be "normal" and what might qualify as a clinical condition. I admire your courage in realizing something might be off and reaching out. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have had some similar thoughts in terms of wishing things would just end, but I'd never intentionally do anything about it because I wouldn't want to cause my friends and family pain. In my experience anxiety and depression can come and go, they can also be "behind the scenes" types of things that were bottle up on the inside. I also think some try to just hide it or rationalize it away but long term it won't help.If it's at all possible, are there counselors or therapists available at your school?  Those professionals are better equipped to evaluate your particular situation to see if a diagnosis is appropriate, and if so, what treatments are available. Personally I started therapy earlier this year and even my family have noticed improvements in me. I wish you the best of luck whatever you choose, and hope things get better.
feb90 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and they recommended CBT. I‚Äôm a big one for catastrophising and also assuming other people‚Äôs thoughts about me.
pesh527 [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety. So I'm not using the term loosely... I'm using it to describe what actually happened to me. Where did you get the idea that I don't actually have anxiety?Also, it's my employer's responsibility to protect me from sexual harassment. I shouldn't have to do something I'm uncomfortable with, and I don't have the authority to ban this customer from the store.
cripple2493 [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety and agoraphobia and I find myself unable to leave the house due to anxiety and asking myself if I'm faking it - so yeah
PastaBod [info] Im in a state where its legal for medical use and i share that sentiment. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder. I dont ever use on the job (personal preference) but i think its wild that i could take the xanax my doctor offered to prescribe me (that i declined bc i have a family history of drug/alcohol addiction) with no occupational pushback yet i could get fired if i did smoke on the job. Lol makes total sense
fl33twoodmacs3xpants [info] I've had many if these tendencies my entire life and never even thought about it. Then I was diagnosed with anxiety at 28 and realized how weird it was.
LostSoul2137 [info] No to panic attacks and I was diagnosed with anxiety on an unrelated issue but I know the feeling of anxiety it‚Äôs like a pressure on my chest and this is not it plus I‚Äôm not anxious about anything when it happens. I could be listening to music or just cooking some food when all of a sudden my lungs forgot their one job
ShylyFrustrating [info] Developed after purchase meaning I can submit for claim is it? I am scared that my employer would know if they know I have a psychiatric condition that may raise red flags haha because i did not declare while signing contract. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder n taking medications for it but it does not affect my work. Should I tell my employer?
dogfins25 [info] I had this problem for many years.  This was actually a symptom I had before I was diagnosed with anxiety.  I went thru a bunch of tests to see if it was a physical issue and it wasn't until I started high school and my anxiety got worse that I got help. First I wouldn't recommend wearing a maxi pad. If you do it once it may become a habit. I did this for years and I had to "wean" myself off them, I would wear the thick heavy flow ones daily because I was afraid of having an accident. I would also tie a sweater around my waist. I would go to the bathroom, clean up and then sit down again because "Oh! I still have to go a little bit" so that became a nasty cycle and I would spend a long time in the bathroom. I always had to know where the toilet was and if I didn't have access to one... I hated school assemblys because I felt trapped.  I was terrified of school trips because the bus didn't have a bathroom. You know what though, I NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT. Ever. If you can distract yourself on the bus that may help, read a book, listen to music, talk to someone on the phone. You can PM me if you want. It will be OK. 
Kenners2712 [info] Before I was diagnosed with anxiety I thought I had some kind of recurrent stomach virus.... For a year.... During this period I was given a super low dose of amitriptyline (used to be used as an anti-depressant at high dose) to help with the stomach upset, I take these in the evening - took a week to get used to it but omg it's helped SO much. I also take omeprazole which is an anti-acid, as even though I don't get the pain of acid reflux apparently I still have it (discovered during a gastroscopy). It really helps to calm my stomach and stop the nausea and diarrhea which are the main symptoms of my anxiety. My anxiety causes my stomach to produce a lot of acid which causes the diarrhea and vomiting.From what I've seen on Reddit lots of people are on all kind of meds which I've never heard of, these two I'm on are solely to treat the physical symptoms in my stomach/gut. Hopefully this helps somewhat! :)
TastingTheSun [info] I currently take 2 medications. I take 75mg of Zoloft and I‚Äôm tapering up on Lamictal. I have therapy once a week  since it‚Äôs provided for free through my university . I was diagnosed with anxiety and major depressive disorder first, then bipolar disorder came into play once I started taking SSRI‚Äôs and it triggered mania. I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder because I‚Äôm too ashamed to talk to my therapist about it.
Antkn33z [info] I've been pretty open about it with my parents for years. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I'm on medication. I think I'm just going through a rough spot anxiety-wise right now. I'll soldier on through this.
ammubi [info] When I was 11, I was home alone and a chip got stuck in my throat. I had my first panic attack (tingling hands, shaking, hyperventilating). After that,  I was terrified to eat for fear of choking and I developed severe anxiety. I was in the exact same boat as you, only consuming liquids. When I would try to eat solids, I would chew non-stop and couldn't bring myself to swallow. I remember being so scared to die due to malnutrition, but at the same time I was scared to die from choking. This was one of the toughest times in my life. I went to therapy and was told I couldn't be helped because the therapist thought I had an eating disorder. My family had no idea how to help. I kept hyperventilating and my mom took me to the ER twice (that was when I was diagnosed with anxiety and hyperventilation). I remember riding by a cemetery and imagining my family picking out a casket for my funeral. At people's houses, I would spit my food into a napkin to pretend I was eating or I would hide food and then flush it down the toilet. My anxiety got so bad I could barely ride in a car without getting a panic attack. In all honesty, one day I just had enough. It was like all this strength and bravery just came over me. I ate a hotdog of all things. I didn't chew a thousand times. I just ate normally. I think no matter how much support you have, you are your biggest supporter. You have the power to take control. It's definitely not easy, but if I can get through it, so can you! Take it slow, start with something soft, take small bites, even if it's just a few and then you're done for the day.I believe in you. You've got this. Stay strong and know you are not alone!
gloomis120 [info] Hey there. I finished 75 Hard a couple weeks ago, and I've been diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) and depression. It definitely helped me in many ways. After about the first week, I noticed that my mind was shifting from the whole "procrastinating and sitting around worrying", to needing to do things right away and not thinking about it. I did however fail after 18 days, and that was a learning experience as well. I dwelled on it, got depressed, and finally picked myself back up and started over. I found the reading to be relaxing and much needed in my daily life now. Overall, i think 75 Hard helps those of us with mental illness because it gives a laid out path with goals. Since completing 75 Hard, I've found it easier to get my tasks done in daily life and instead of feeling like I'm being stagnant in life, I've been very proactive and in control. My confidence has went up as well.If there's anything specific I can answer, feel free to ask.
Pr3ttynp3tty [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety auditory processing disorder (never effects me anymore I think I "Grew out of it")  Sensory Processing Disorder Dyscalculia Mind dyslexia (more speech)  So 5
ItsJustLittleOldMe [info] I have felt the same as you and I understand your fear but you are probably NOT about to die. (I am not a doctor, but you were just examined by one who said the same.)   :)   I know exactly what you mean about the "before people die" thing. I cannot tell you how many times I have been afraid I was about to die. Trust me, it was a LOT but I didn't die any of those times.You, like me, have anxiety issues that sound like they are health-related. Hypochondria sucks. Anxiety sucks. Panic attacks suck. I know my friend. Look forward to that doctor appointment. I'm hoping it's with a mental health professional. They can help you.In the mean time, distract yourself when you start to worry. Count to yourself in threes, or say the alphabet backward. Mentally describe in detail something very mundane, like the car that's parked next to you, or the flower. YOU can actually experience panic symptoms without letting the fear take control. Don't be afraid of fear. I know it sounds crazy. You can experience the fear and let it pass by, reminding yourself that "this is just panic" and it will pass.The best type of mental health treatment for anxiety seems to be cognitive behavioral therapy and sometimes we need meds too. There is hope. I have seen people recover from just CBT. I have seen people recover from just meds. Sometimes it's a combination of both. Sometimes things get better and then bug us again from time to time and you need a little help from time to time. There is hope.Again, I am not a doctor but I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder over 20 years ago.I hope others will reply as well so you really know you are not alone. There are so many tips and things to try to put yourself at ease when you feel anxious.Stay well. You can do it!   :)
Lordkeravrium [info] Honestly, things like these do kind of bother me. Especially when people claim I‚Äôm bluffing. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD at eight by a developmental pediatrician. So yeah
