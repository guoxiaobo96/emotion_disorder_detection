flperson [info] 6 months is not excessive time to try out a new treatment for anxiety.I have been diagnosed with anxiety by a few different Dr.s over the years and trying CBD oil is the only time I have self treated with something that is not a prescription.I've talked to many doctors, I cannot afford one currently.We are having this conversation because you don't know what you're talking about and hopefully my explanations and experiences can help someone..."Get some medicaid/Medicare... It's pretty much free if he's actually broke."  I hope this comment is just you being silly or sarcastic or something... Getting useful coverage through the gov't is not easy in any way. My wife and I and one child had a household income last year of $24,000 before taxes. This gets me "medically necessary" coverage through medicare which is only good for emergency services above a certain amount. (I believe this is $5000, but am not sure ). That's it. There are county/state programs and income based fee services, which I have tried in the past, but they are another story in itself. Right now CBD is something that a bunch of people are having great results with and I thought I would try it out since I don't need a prescription and the possible side effects are negligible. That's pretty much it... [info] None [info] 1549300829 [info] test
kiosk68 [info] Yes!! The same exact thing happened to me. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I told my doctor all of my symptoms and he suggested “meditation” which was bullshit. I later found out after going to a psychiatrist that i did have anxiety and all of my head aches, sleepless nights, etc. were due to that. It’s best when you have one of these head aches to be in a dark room if you can. Try getting peppermint oil and rub that on your temples. Aleve personally works somewhat better for me. To help the physical symptoms, it really does help eating as healthy as you can and exercising. [info] None [info] 1560150647 [info] test
SinLives [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder and agoraphobia but I gotta say I agree with you 100%. I can't take any anxiety medication like benzos cause I am on other meds they would interact with. So I don't have a fast acting pill I can pop to just make everything OK. There are plenty of breathing exercises and pre planning things you can do. If I'm nervous about something I have to NOT overthink it. That is the basis for a lot of people's problems. I just make up my mind if something has to be done then I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna let a diagnosis hold me back or make me prisoner in my own home. And as far as the lady pushing cop she should be charged with assault. There are laws in place for a reason. Do you excuse people for rape because their feelings made them do it? I'm sure people won't like my opinion but people with anxiety need to actively take steps to work thru it. Medications can help, therapy can help, but ultimately it comes down to that person working on it not hiding behind it. I understand it's different for everyone but it can't be used as an excuse for everything.  [info] None [info] 1547059068 [info] test
hdbaker009 [info] I seriously need help with my mental health. I feel my self declining with chronic worry and debilitating anxiety every other day. I can’t go on like this but I’m so broke and have awful health insurance. I was diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) a couple years ago. I was seeking counseling for it and benefited from it, when I had great insurance. Fast forward to now, husband got a new job and the insurance is shit. Utter shit. Not only that, but I called about three therapists in my area and none of them accepted my insurance. Each session is about $90 here and I simply cannot afford that. I would ask family for help, but we’ve already had to have help and am paying some family members back monthly, so I’m not doing that. I’m 26F but I worry chronically. It’s now become where I worry myself sick. Especially over health related issues, some that any normal person wouldn’t bat an eye at. I’m over sensitive to any “symptom” and not just in myself but my families, too. It’s not just occasionally that I worry, but about every other day. I’ll start to think about something, find one sign that it could be awful and I can’t for the love of Pete get my mind off of it. It’s affecting my mood, which effects my relationship with my family, and I’m afraid I’m going to lose control. I need help. I don’t know where to turn. I don’t like to burden friends with my problems and even if we was just talking about it lightly, that’s all I would ever talk about because there is always something weighing very heavy on my mind.

Help_Me_Reddit01 [info] If I don’t stop, I’m going to allow my anxiety to ruin my relationship. Hi everyone! I’m a 24 year old female. I am diagnosed with anxiety and take Wellbutrin for it. I don’t have the best dating history, I’ve been screwed over more times than I can count and I’m now extremely guarded. This now just leads me to overthink every little thing and say what it to every single situation. Within the last week or so, I reconnected with a 27 year old male who I went to college with. He’s always tried to pursue something with me but we wanted different things at the time. He texted me this week asking me to just give him a chance after we had a brief conversation on Snapchat. We went back and forth for TWO days about possibly trying something out. He lives two hours away right now and really it’s not ideal. He asked me to meet him halfway to grab dinner, which we did last night. We now text just about 24/7 some of its sexual but for the most part it isn’t. We ate dinner and it was fine. Afterwards, we sat in my car for over two hours talking about everything. He explained how he’s 27 now and really just needs to get it together and settle down. He admitted he has feelings and such. I overthink things so I was skeptical of everything. He basically told me I’m in a huge emotional hole that I really need to start climbing out of because it’s just going to push people away. I brought up the idea that maybe he’s just putting on a front to get into my pants and honestly he wasn’t too happy that I said that and basically said if I wanted you for sex, I wouldn’t have driven over and hour for dinner and then sit here talking about a relationship with you for a couple hours. Overall the talk was good and now I just have thinking to do. Ultimately after hearing me ramble for over an hour he flat out asked me if I was even ready or could handle a relationship?I really said I don’t know more than I could count. I’m pretty sure that’s all I could say. I told him I really just needed to think about things and seemed a little confused/disappointed because he was putting it all out on the table and the only thing I could say was “I don’t know”.  We did kiss, he played with my hair and kissed my forehead. It was all fine. He asked to see me again today but, I’m leaving for vacation tomorrow morning for a week so I needed to pack and so on. So I’m supposed to see him when I get back from my trip. He asked which part of Florida I’ll be in, which is Miami. He’s concerned I’ll find a guy in Florida and that Miami is completely unsafe (he’s a cop). I’m constantly thinking everything he’s saying and doing are all a front but I have nothing to support that other than he was only into casual relationships in 2015, which I did also address yesterday. How in the hell do I allow myself to chill the hell out without reading into or overthinking every single thing he does or says. I’m driving myself nuts and I really don’t know how long he’s going to remain patient with me. [info] None [info] 1563224902 [info] test
bigangryhobbit [info] I am no stranger to mental illness, and I know what its like to not be able to finish school because of it.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder with agoraphobia 20 years ago.  It was tough.  I went to college 3 times and never could keep it together becuase of classroom anxiety/panic.  I tried every medication imaginable during those 20 years.  I have been self employed for half of that time.  I could never work a physically demanding job unfortuantely.  Somehow, I continue to push on.  Its nice to have come into contact with you.  Its hard to find people that truly understand what living with a mental disability is like, and how much of an obstacle it is.  We aren't lunatics, we just have a health disorder like anybody else that may have something wrong with them.  Good luck to you!  Always have hope that things can change for the better, no matter how bleak it may seem.  I have been off of all medications for 4 years and live a better life than I ever have.

leyjanz [info] Just when I feel I have my anxiety under control, it comes back stronger than before. Hey all! I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder about 4 years ago. I've experienced it since I was a child but was labeled the worrier/emotional kid. Since being diagnosed, I've felt empowered to take steps to cope with my anxiety, and the in last 6 months I've had less frequent attacks/episodes.I have noticed that when I do experience anxiety now, it comes out of nowhere, more intensely than ever. I wake up shaking, I sleep maybe 4 hours a night, and I completely disconnect from everyone around me because I'm afraid of being negative/that they will be mad at me. My husband is so supportive but I hate having to tell him that I am yet again dealing with my mental health. I wish I could just solve it and be done.What long term steps have you taken to cope? It feels like I am safe until I fall into this trap, slowly make my way out and I'm fine until the next round. Does anyone experience this like...relapse? Sorry for the negative rant!! Thank you in advance!EDIT : I feel like I should add that I have been exercising at least 3-4 times a week now which has been a huge help, but I'm finding that I start to spiral if I don't go to the gym. Anyone experience this? I love exercise but I don't want it to be a crutch. [info] None [info] 1579234813 [info] test

jennlody [info] I definitely do. I started getting sicker when I was 15, and no one believed me. I never threw up so they couldn't actually see any symptoms so they thought it was in my head. They thought I was being bullied or was scared to go to school so I was making up being sick so I didn't have to go. They bribed me with donuts ironically. I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on meds. After months of treatments not working, my mom asked to rule anything else out and they found the Celiac. Now over 6 years later I actually do have awful anxiety, especially when I go to see new doctors and when eating around other people. Luckily my family believes me now but they don't fully understand how stressed I get over these things. At least my parents apologized back then for being mad at me for skipping out on plans once they realized I really was sick at the time. [info] None [info] 1562727080 [info] test
Palonirya [info] This post actually made me tear up a little bit.I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2009, by actual doctors in an actual hospital and not just some internet forum, and even though I am so much better mentally than I was back then, there are still times when I will disassociate to the point where my own name doesn't feel as though it belongs to me.Knowing that there are people my age out there who will actively feign having anxiety and other mental illnesses and who think that having a mental illness means you literally have to talk about it all the time makes me sick. It is NOT so easy and so intriguing to talk about that you can write reams and reams on Tumblr about how your life is 'full of darkness' and how your body aches. A lot of the time you don't even want to talk about it because it can make you feel worse.The last thing I want to do when I'm having issues with my anxiety is turn it into a freaking poem for the internet to enjoy and praise me for.

jennyfromthebloccc [info] Things are falling into place for me for the first time in a while and I am so happy about it that I feel the need to share (lol) This is my first post on this sub - you are all so amazing!So here’s the deal, I’m a junior at an incredible university majoring in Human Resource Management - only problem is that I hate human resource management lol. Going into uni, I had no clue what I wanted to major in and HR seemed convincing and the fact that I am a people person made it seem like a decent fit. Over the last 2 years I have had 3 INCREDIBLE internships at very well known and large scale companies but I was absolutely miserable at all of them. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was only 11 years old and after starting college, it got severe and led me down a very dark and depressing path. I cut myself off from my friends, family, peers, and just about anything fun. It was bad. I figured, let me just get my degree and figure it out maybe it’ll grow on me. Fast forward to this past summer and I got a very random opportunity through a family friend to intern at a Superior Court in a judges chambers. From the first day of this internship, I absolutely loved it and truly believe that I have found what I was meant to do. I always had an interest in law and the legal system but never knew where to get started. Now, my internship has been extended to the fall semester and the judge PERSONALLY said that he sees incredible potential in me as an attorney which means a lot coming from him (he’s a pretty big deal). Fast forward again to this afternoon where I used the money I made from this summer to buy very expensive but necessary books to start studying for the LSAT and have already begun research on law schools that are likely within my reach.  I have never been this happy and PROUD of myself. For some, this may seem silly of me and you may be thinking “well yeah - a lot of people find something they love and want to pursue”. I never thought this would happen for me. I was prepared to sit in an office for the rest of my life and become a robot. I am so excited for myself and this journey I am beginning. Much love!

So first off I am diagnosed with anxiety and I am normally on medication for it but I have been out for a few days now. So I dont know if this is related to that at all, but I've never had this happen before. So since Sunday night I have been feeling dizzy and having heart flutters when I'm up and moving. If I'm sitting or leaning against something I'm fine. It feels like waves washing over me every minute or so. I just took a shower and I've been sitting down for about 15 minutes now and it still hasn't gone away. I tried googling my symptoms and of course I'm extra paranoid now. I also didn't want to call the ER and ask because I know they take heart stuff very seriously.

trashbasically [info] Want to give phenibut a go but I'm scared I won't be able to keep it in moderation Basically I've read a lot of about phenibut and it seriously sounds like a godsend. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 14 and I'm turning 21. It was always pretty manageable and for a year when I was 16 weed was the greatest anxiety-reliever. For the past (almost) five years I've been toking practically all day every day even though it makes me an anxious wreck and I have no life outside of smoking weed and going to work. So what I want to do is grab a little bit of phenibut online, and on my days off during the week that's when I'd dose. Usually my two days off are different every week, never weekends, and they always feel like such a waste. I always have so much in mind but my anxiety keeps me at my mom's house. I feel like with phenibut I'd be more proactive. But I know that if it's the relief I'm imagining to to be I'll get carried away. And I know that addiction to the stuff is no good and the withdrawals are even worse. How do you guys dose in moderation? Be it phenibut or anything else, how do you do it?

reallyokfinewhatever [info] &gt; How can you tell if your struggles are due to an actual issue, or due to finally hitting a "challenging" level of work that is actually hard for you?In grade school up to 6th grade, school was shockingly easy for me. Laughably easy. I was told I was a bright kid. I was told I was naturally good at everything--sports, music, math, writing.In 7th grade I got my first A instead of an A+ (*shock!horror*). And I wondered if I wasn't smart anymore. In 8th grade I got my first B+ and I honestly thought I was completely failing, or had contracted a terminal brain diseases or something.In high school, I realized kids did this thing called "studying" and I didn't get how staring at a textbook made you smarter. My strategy was always to get really stressed out the day before a test and just wing it. I thought, if I didn't just know it then I must be inherently stupid and bad at learning.I spent SO much time trying to figure out how to study. I could stare at a textbook taking notes for hours and retain nothing. Meanwhile, I also found that turning my studying into games--like simultaneously teaching myself PHP in order to code myself a practice test for history class--made my information retention skyrocket.As I continued to go up in grade levels, college, etc. I came to find that I actually had NO sense of discipline, motivation, or focus. My entire four years in college were spent agonizing over how much I could not focus, feeling like a failure, and missing deadlines.I wished desperately for the years when I was little that everything just made sense to me because I thought that was how I was SUPPOSED to be--just inherently knowing everything without trying. When I had to truly focus and work hard to learn, I found my thoughts were actually completely scattered this whole time, and it made me increasingly agitated and incapable of functioning.For a long time I was diagnosed with anxiety (which, to be fair, I totally had/have). Like the typical high-functioning kid/young adult I was, every time I said something that revealed my low self-esteem, I was tagged as the typical perfectionist pretty girl with anxiety and an eating disorder. No one ever suspected ADHD until I did, and it wasn't until AFTER college when my symptoms finally became so extremely obvious, completely outside of an academic setting.All this to say maybe think about the non-academic symptoms you might be having--it became laughably obvious to me that ADHD was the driving factor my whole life once I came to identify all the symptoms I had that were not aggravated by school.

novusflorae [info] DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!Well, I have been wanting to do comedy for a very long time. But I always chalked it up to "oh, but I am just conversationally funny." Last year I met a girl who ended up being my other half - one of my closest pals. Her and I clown all the time, and it really opened up a can of worms. I started to go to more and more comedy shows, frequenting open mic nights, and really just enjoying watching people just give it a try. I was going to do a routine last summer time, but I always made up excuses of why not to. THEN three weeks ago I was diagnosed with anxiety/ADD - ADD I totally expected, but anxiety wasn't even on my radar. BOTH explained so much. I started to take Ritalin to help me focus, then all of a sudden I was able to actually do all the different creative stuff that I always felt overwhelmed by. Started to paint (first time in 2 years), sew, and write down comedy monologues.My friend was hosting an open mic this weekend, and I felt, "what the fuck, just go ahead and do it." So, I had a funny thought about how excited I am when I get my period even when I know for damn certain that I did not have sex in the past 28 days and I know I couldn't be pregnant - After seeing a drop of blood during a restroom break at work. I sat down at my computer right after and wrote down a stream of thought. Practiced it for three days, and it turned out to be set for the night.  As for the courage - I am not sure. Haha, I didn't feel that much anxiety going up to the mic when my name was called. I do not have problem with public speaking - I was a TA for undergrad/grad courses and a MS/HS class tutor for 4 years. I really don't care about getting laughs for my jokes, because really I just LOVE a captive audience. Its empowering to have someone have to pay attention to you because they're future depends on it. With my students it was their grades, and for the audience its if they're going to have a good time or not. I would joke around with my students, and their bonus question would be "What joke did Ms. Novus make when talking about mitochondria?"It wasn't that bad, and everyone was super encouraging. Even if I had bombed, that would have been great too. Because I know not everyone likes grapefruit, and that doesn't make the grapefruit any less of a grapefruit.

BlueInkSz [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety issues at first. The foundations of my paranoia/"paranoia" are things that are completely possible, even though I have been unable to fathom a true reason behind them. An old therapist of mine said it was anxiety related. Fast forward a few years and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia by someone who had far less information. Of course, I fully realize I've gone off the rails with paranoia at times, which really sucks, because there are certain things in my life that actually happened that no one takes seriously anymore. Long story short, schizophrenia is the convenient excuse and some people are manipulative scum.Of course, since I know people with schizophrenia who believe such things are a dime a dozen, I don't expect to be believed.

A year and up to about a month or two before the itching started I was on an Ssri (first ever anxiety medication taken) for anxiety called Paxil hated it because it caused me to gain a whopping 50 pounds so I went off and didn’t find that I really had anxiety that bad that I needed a medication just primary dr thought I did for social anxiety. Anyways had panic attack about two months ago my first ever and oddly when I was at the worst of the attack for the first week or two where I would get tremors in my stomach, extreme nausea, couldn’t sleep 4 days in a row the itching stopped randomly (still wasn’t on any medication yet oh wait I did take Zoloft for 2 days the day after my attack happened hated that it didn’t help immediately so cut it off cold turkey) then because this was my first panic attack and I didn’t know it was a panic attack I had went to the ER three times within two weeks and every time I was diagnosed with anxiety reaction I even had blood testing (every visit) brain scans done and ekg and a stomach ultrasound and all came back fine. and the third time I actually got a prescription from the ER doctor for Ativan not just giving me the iv and sending me with nothing home. The Ativan worked good stopped my itching completely but I hate how innorder for it to help my other anxiety symptoms I had to take it every 7-8 hours or it would wear off quite quickly. Now my psychiatrist who I hadn’t seen in a year since being off Paxil switched me to valium 5mg two pills 3x a day and my itching has stopped now we are trying to get off the benzos and onto more of a long term medication like an Ssri. So today we started in the morning to cut down drs orders to taking one pill 3x a day and I could immediately notice the itching came back when I woke up. Do you think then that itching like this is an anxiety related problem if regular and hemorrhoid specialist doctors couldn’t find a medical problem wrong with why I am itching and only at night?

hushxx18 [info] Tips for anxiety? I been having really bad anxiety for the past two weeks. It feels like I’m going crazy (when I’m not) Some background info; I have been diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 14. I’m almost 20 now. I have these rough periods every couple years but usually I’m okay. I haven’t had anxiety in over a year- maybe two, so it hit me really hard. It’s the same old same old, cant breathe, intrusive thoughts/ thoughts that don’t make sense, can’t sleep, feels like I’m going crazy, but the newest one is derealization, where it feels like I’m not in control of my body. I don’t have many friends so I can’t do things or talk to people to get my mind off. And my family is extremely abusive and won’t be much of a help to speak to.

MommyNeedsATimeOut [info] SSRIs I have been seeing a therapist for the last month and she is recommending that I start a SSRI. I have no previous experience taking any medication. I was diagnosed with anxiety, OCD and PTSD. I would also like something to help with my lack of motivation and focus.

snowfarts [info] I had the exact same symptoms when I got diagnosed this year. I was honest with my doctor and told her I had tried adderall, and it worked well when I did. My therapist is also in the same office so it helped. I am diagnosed with anxiety as well, and we were all concerned it would worsen my anxiety. I told them that no matter what the outcome was, I didn’t want to try anxiety meds and I’m willing to risk my anxiety being worse. If I know what’s causing it, it’s typically not an issue anyway. My therapist also said it was worth a try because either my anxiety was caused by my ADD, or they were two different things. I’ve been on it for 3 or 4 months now and my life is completely changed for the better. My anxiety was 100% caused by my ADD. I don’t get overwhelmed with all of the shit I have to do, and I’m actually able to do it instead of procrastinate. My doctor keeps me on a low dose, and I no longer get the feeling you experience at first (at first I was sad but then realized I cannot want to feel that ‘high’ feeling). I just feel like a normal person, which is weird because I thought I felt like that before. Except before it felt like I was living life with clouds in my brain and eyes, making me sleepy and unable to care about anything. I also have insomnia and it hasn’t affected it, if it does your dose is too strong. For a while I could NOT sleep and surprise, it was because of my anxiety. My therapist told me I was so worried about my sleep I was making myself unable to do so. Now I just lay down and if I’m laying for a minute, I don’t care. I just lay there. I’ll take melatonin every once in a while.Sorry for this literal essay.. I still have add, its just managed. [info] None [info] 1566853854 [info] test

bk513 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was about 14. I’m sure I do have anxiety, but it took until my senior year of high school for a doctor to say i might have ADHD. I’ve had trouble with time management and focusing since I was 6 years old, but I was always led to believe I was just a “slow worker.” I’ve never had problems with hyperactivity and I had good grades, so I guess that made it harder to see.

JLeww69 [info] Earlier this year I was diagnosed with anxiety after a long conversation with my parents. After two therapy sessions I met with a doctor to discuss what my options were. I explained to her that a few of my friends have anxiety and that they've gone through a variety of different medications with no avail. They were finally prescribed gabapentin which worked the best out of all the medications they had tried. I told her that after researching all of my options I decided that gabapentin would be the best choice for me since I didn't want anything addicting like a benzo or a ssri because of the wd horror stories. She acted like she had never heard of gabapentin before and prescribed me propranolol which doesn't seem to work at all. Prop's main use is to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety such as rapid heartbeat and sweating which I never even reported experiencing with my therapist prior to the meeting with the doctor... The whole spiel about my friends getting prescribed gabapentin was a lie but I truly did believe gabapentin would be the best option for me. Plus I knew it would be useful for the kratom addiction I had at the time. Oh well. I just had to get all of that off my chest.  [info] None [info] 1506879015 [info] test
lonelyanxiousfreak [info] It will be difficult to type me since my medical condition influences my emotions and hobbies. It is a mobility-challenged related disability. And my other medical condition gives me self esteem issues as a female physically.• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.I am a 17 year old soon to be 18 girl. I play video games, read on science, and love human anatomy.• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. And my disability (condition) makes me bitter toward abled people.• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?I was abused as an infant, my feet tied together and never given toys or talked to, only when I needed food and water (poor orphanage). When I was adopted at age 2, I became part of a Catholic family. We rarely practice and only pray on holidays. I personally don’t believe in a higher being.• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I have none.• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?I would be refreshed despite wanting friends for once. I need my alone time often since I am energetic in public or am overwhelmed by crowds, smell, touch, sounds, etc• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?I like video games and drawing but due to neck pain they are burning out fast. I want to like sports, but am banned from the ones I’ve always wanted to try (why I resent those who play them). I would love outdoor walks if my skin wasn’t hypersensitive. But for now I am an indoor person due to medical reasons. I love music though. Music sparks my vivid imagination and distracts me from my pain.• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?Let’s just say people are extremely annoyed by me because I ask “why” to everything. And I do have more ideas than I can execute. My curiosities are why people are being nice, ask how I am, how the universe works, how animals relate to each other, etc.. My ideas are conceptual and about the universe and the far future of it and earth.• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?No. But yes, I think I would be fairly okay. I first would assign a task for each person and expect them to do it regardless of circumstances unless physical problem.• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?I seem to get into arguments a lot, so probably not. And I enjoy playing with clay. It makes my sensitive skin feel nice. Ceramics or simple clay is the activity.• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.I used to be very artistic but am not anymore. I draw my original character, a transgender shapeshifter trying to fit into a human society.• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I think of the past and future too much. I hate thinking about the past and can never move on until I get closure. And I think about the far future because it’s fun and you get to make up depressing scenarios of the earth ending. The present is fine but I believe in those who are competent should be alive and anyone who fails constantly should be discarded. If I was a ruler I would be like the government in the Harrison Bergeron short story.• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?I hate when others ask for my help. It’s not my problem. I do it anyway to appear good or expect something in return.• Do you need logical consistency in your life?Yes. Dear god.• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?It is not that important unless I was a leader of a company.• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?I correct people or point out flaws, but that’s as far as I go unless someone’s incompetent in-game sensitivity is pissing me off because it’s too high.• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?I play video games, draw, and read online. I honestly don’t like them that much besides video games. It’s painful to do pretty much anything except breathing, so video games are the least painful hobby therefore I’ll do it.• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?I memorize. I am too stupid to truly understand a concept. Math, I struggle with a lot and hate. Numbers shift or disappear in my head, even like simple 5+7 I can’t solve in my head unless I use my fingers. I prefer classes that use memorization and logic like biology, chemistry, physics, any science or history related class. People say I have an abnormally good memory for my academics or trivial facts.• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?I am good at it but never take action using it. I break up projects according to what I think I can do in a certain period of time. This is for school only. For my own projects I improvise.• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?I want to be a radiologist! I find anatomy fascinating. And personally I want to be happy and true to myself.• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?A lot. Tardigrades, spiders, ants, etc.. But seriously, those who are younger than me and smarter, abled people, girls (have another medical condition that makes me kind of jealous of “normal” girls), and anyone who makes me look handicapped or stupid. I heavily rely on what my mind is capable of since my body is useless. I hate fake people who just smile to be nice. I want a damn conversation where someone replies with something other than “okay” or “cool.” And who won’t mind my partial hearing loss and repeat something maybe four times.• What do the "highs" in your life look like?Video game victories unfortunately and also overcoming 17 surgeries. In general though, figuring on my own what medical condition someone has from an image alone, getting a math problem right because of possible dyscalculia, and being called “smart” to boost my nonexistent self-esteem.• What do the "lows" in your life look like?I never talk about negative emotions. At worst I talk about anger. I have never discussed deep sadness with anyone in my life. I put emotional walls up and bottle up my feelings since I don’t think crying is rational. And I get annoyed by those who cry anyway (could be projecting). I would prefer to keep my funny, outgoing, friendly and happy image alive.• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?I am attached to it fairly well, but only due to hypersensitivity and easy distraction externally. If I wasn’t then I would be daydreaming endlessly. I wear music for sound sensitivity and usually I start daydreaming. And I am aware of my surroundings usually. But I get startled if someone touches me while I daydream.• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?When will we all be killed and what will our dystopian civilization look like?How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?If important, a few days. And usually I change my mind and have endless alternatives I worry about.• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?I do not process them. I reject any hint of sadness and put it in the back of my head. I hate emotions. But if a subject intrigues me I will be grinning the entire time shouting about it.• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?Never. It’s not my problem if you disagree. I will argue until I get closure like a good discussion and conclusion or am declared right.• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?No. They should not be challenged usually. If I do break rules, I want to experience what others do on a daily basis like doing sports I am not supposed to do (basketball or dodgeball are examples). Or I break rules ironically to do academic work like homework during school mass in the bathroom secretly. Hey, free hour and a half study hall, okay?• What is the ideal life, in your opinion?The ability to exercise and play sports without pain, middle or higher financial class, having friends but also mainly being a loner, and being happy in your own skin.

cuebabies [info] I’m 25, just diagnosed with anxiety disorder, unsure if symptoms are all related to anxiety. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder just 2 months ago. In short I had a massive panic attack after smoking some weed 2 years ago since then I’ve been very anxious when I feel a symptom similar to the attack. Fast heart rate, dizziness, chest pains, and muscle spasms all get me thinking something bad is about to happen. I notice in the onset of an attack my bowels get loose as well. I’ve come to accept this is anxiety, a couple of doctors have told me the same.1 week ago I woke up with a headache and it’s been on and off until today, sometimes it’s intense other times it’s just barely noticeable.  Also I’ll feel pins and needles on my chest and what feels like the heart. Does anyone know if this is also related to anxiety?? [info] None [info] 1546571281 [info] test
PaperCats4 [info] Finally went to see a doctor. I have celexa questions I thought the way I was feeling would go away on its own. I've never been depressed before but I've always been someone who is anxious. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder as a teenager. But, for the past two months it's like I've been living in a nightmare. I'm always tired. I feel numb most of the time but when I do feel emotion its irritability or intense hopelessness and fears of being stuck like this forever. I feel heavy and like I can't do anything I enjoy. Lately, even making and eating food has become a huge chore and I'm eat a lot less. I can't do my research or my writing and I fear what will happen when the semester starts, I go back to teaching, and I can barely get out of bed. People told me not to see a doctor. They said medications aren't the solution and that it will just mask my problems. Some have said that the meds change who you are as a person and that you become addicted. But, I feel so miserable that I finally bit the bullet and went to see someone. Herbs, essential oils, and yoga don't help. Someone told me to take up a hobby to cure my sadness but the thing is that this isn't sadness. I'm aware that I have a pretty good life. I have a career that I love and it pays well. I have a supportive and loving spouse, a house of my own, and three amazing cats. I have hobbies and friends. It's just that I can't enjoy any of these things lately.   Anyway, the doctor referred me to psychotherapy which I will definitely do. She also prescribed Celexa. I'm starting on 5mg per day for 2 weeks, then 10mg per day for 2 weeks, and then 20mg. However, I've sort of scared myself looking at side effects. I've read that it can cause fatal heart conditions, liver disease, libido loss, low salt levels in the blood, seizures, etc. How common are these side effects?   Also, my doctor said I can expect to notice some change at 4 weeks. Does that sound correct? What do I do until then? [info] None [info] 1564441808 [info] test
weetabixgirl [info] Needing to vent I think maybe I just need to vent. I got married Dec 2015. My husband has changed with marriage (he has become even more loving and supporting than he was before). But I feel like a burden to him, I got here on a non immigrant visa and I was kind of forced to change my immigration status. He submitted my paperwork on april 10th.I recently lost my job and I've had quite a few job offers ever since (I got a BAchelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering with an Android app development certification). I was also diagnosed with anxiety and I am unable to continue my treatment due to lack of insurance.Today not only I got into an accident and destroyed my beautiful mustang, I also realized that I only got 3 weeks left until my driver's license expires and I won't be able to renew it until my EAD comes in and most importantly, I cannot get a new job without my EAD.I already lost 2 good job opportunities, one of them as a Security Analyst and the other one as an entry level Network Engineer. This whole situation is also affecting my health, like I said I was diagnosed with anxiety and suffered from PTSD in the past (for those who think that you need to be a war veteran in order to be diagnosed with PTSD, you are wrong).I have no car, no drivers license, no job and I am in a foreign country. My husband tries his best to cheer me up (I love him and I feel like I hit the husband jackpot) he brings me flowers and texts me jokes while he is at work and cooks my favorite food for me (cream cheese jalapenos wrapped in bacon) but at the same time I don't want to feel like I am a burden to him, both financially and emotionally (he has a blue collar job, if the tables were turned it would have been a little bit easier for me because most IT jobs are better paid). When I called USCIS to get an update about my EAD status (it's only been 50 days since it was submitted) he guy I spoke to was really rude and told me that "I chose a bad moment to be an immigrant".Has anyone been through a similar situation?

Stell2020 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety as a child, you sound similar to me study wise, I had to work so much more than my peers to achieve the same grades (I did well but man I worked and worked). Hit my mid 20’s and life became too much (maintaining a home, sustaining a job, attempting to cook every night, exercise, then have enough energy and motivation to socialise or at least be pleasant and intimate with my husband). I went to a therapist because I was sure I was depressed, she suggested adhd (to which I laughed, come on I wasn’t that hyperactive kid who was always in trouble and failing school), saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with adhd, started stimulant medication (to which I was worried would increase my anxiety) and within 2 months my anxiety had all but gone! Treat the adhd, so I’m organised, can prioritise, and enjoy life, bye bye anxiety! (It does still effect me when I’m overly stressed/ busy but so much better than before).

tinybluesock [info] I made an appointment to see the doctor.. ...and I’m so scared.  All I feel is angry or scared or sad.  For over a month now.  Before that I had a period of feeling amazing...everything was spotless, I was up on all my reading, I hardly slept and got everything done!  I was productive!  Then... it just stopped.  I stayed in bed all day and skipped classes.  I yelled at my son.  I yelled at my SO, I yelled at myself.  I feel like I just cycle through “everything is awesome!  I am the most productive!” And “everything is shit, I fucking suck!”.  It’s been like that as long as I can remember.  My mother used to tell me I was such a drama queen and needed to grow up.  When I was in high school I was diagnosed with anxiety and possible ocd... but my treatment ended and I still had this flip-flop with no in between stage of “things are going well but I’m not insanely pumped”.  I’m never just... living, im always needing to do all the things, or none of the things.  I always believed that my mother was right and i was a crazy drama queen but I’m starting to think that if I know I’m a drama queen.. shouldn’t I be able to chill a little?  I feel like I don’t have any balance in my life... everything is one extreme or the other, never just...  the grey area?  I guess.. I don’t really know how to explain it and I’m worried my doctor won’t understand.  Or worse, he’ll confirm what my mother said and tell me to grow the fuck up... anyone else ever felt this way?  I feel like I’m crazy.  I feel like I’m realizing that all the things I’ve started and failed (in school mostly but also in relationships, sports...etc) always ends because I hit my “sad phase”.  My SO commented that he thought I should see a doctor, and I took one of those online tests from some Canadian psychology centre and it said I have like a really high chance of having some kind of mood issue so.... I’m kind of hoping I do.  I think it would be nice to be able to feel solid and to be able to function and succeed at stuff :/.  Then again, maybe I just need to work harder?  Sorry this is so long and rambley .... I’m just kind of freaking out, I feel like I’m just a big baby who needs to put on her big girl pants... but then again if I’ve tried that for well over a decade and it hasn’t helped maybe I do need to see the doctor?

vandalizmmm [info] Suffering from scruples again. I've suffered from scrupulosity for the past 11 or so years. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I have sought treatment and thought I was doing better, as I was able to space out my confessions and be more confident in deciding whether or not I should go to confession. However, today I panicked a little over something. I watched a YouTube video that critiqued a certain YouTuber for faking the use of an ouija board for clickbait. The video then showed clips of the aforementioned youtuber's clickbait video. It seemed like the whole thing was faked so I thought there wouldn't be any harm in me watching a silly YouTube critique, but now I'm questioning that. I stopped watching the video and didn't finish it.If I'm questioning whether or not I've sinned, it's a venial sin, right? Should I be super concerned about this? Or should I just try to stay calm and avoid these types of videos in the future? Most importantly, how can a scrupulous person like me overcome these types of "relapses"? I'm tired of being so stressed out over these types of things and would appreciate any help and advice. [info] None [info] 1557855952 [info] test

I have had a horrible year, involving many health problems and the death of a family member. I have a diagnosed autoimmune disorder that causes me to get sick extremely easily. I've  been diagnosed with chronic migraines  which was the lost common reason for calling in sick. I've been diagnosed with anxiety which  was another main reason I was absent often. This job caused me a tremendous  amount of anxiety, and anxiety  attacks can also trigger my migraines.

I feel like my body has just trained itself to wake up whenever I hear her move (her room is next to mine) especially after the incident in March which is where most of my sleeping stopped. It doesn't help that I was diagnosed with anxiety and have been on and off meds for that basically since I was a teenager. [info] None [info] 1558622346 [info] test
underdogkitten [info] "Well, don't feel [insert emotion here]." My nmom uses this anytime I try to voice a problem, particularly when I use I statements to voice how I feel about a situation. Such as "I feel that you going through my things makes me uncomfortable and it makes me feel anxious (I have been diagnosed with anxiety issues and she knows this)." This would prompt her to brush off what I'm saying with "Well, don't feel anxious. It's not a big deal." [info] None [info] 1421373020 [info] test

EchoVixen [info] My partner and I have a similar chemistry. I worry a lot about the big things and the little things. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago. My partner, on the other hand, is the most relaxed person I know. Everything washes over him, nothing phases him. I love him dearly and I know he loves me, but I still worry that my anxiety is grating on him and I sometimes wish he would reassure me the way you do in your post. That being said, he's never been one for speeches or romantic gestures and just as he accepts me, I accept him. He's affectionate in his own way. You seem like a genuinely great person, I hope you and your partner have an amazing future together. [info] None [info] 1540652289 [info] test
WestCoastKate [info] Anxiety over holding baby. Scared of dropping. I am almost 27 weeks with baby #2. My first is almost 8 years old, with such a big gap I jave forgotten a lot. About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety (which, looking back I am fairly certain was PPA) and have been fighting it this entire pregnancy. Currently I am dreading holding my baby. I have a few more months until she is here and I need to figure it out before then. My SIL just had a baby girl and I can't hold her without extreme anxiety/mild panic attacks. I feel like I am going to drop her (even though I have only held her while sitting). I am already on Celexa and it is working pretty well. Any other mom's with anxiety/fear of dropping baby have any tips? What worked for you? [info] None [info] 1529197378 [info] test

Snapley [info] Can I ask a question about your panic attacks? I used to experience both panic attacks and anxiety attacks (I think they are different but they could be the same) Please ignore the rest of the comment if you don’t want to answer or you think it’s too sensitive a question.It felt like two different things to me, and I am diagnosed with anxiety by a professional, but it hasn’t been a big issue for a while. One type of attack felt like worries were in my head and I would get all the emotional and physical symptoms.But the other type of attack didn’t seem to be triggered by any anxious thought, it would come out of nowhere and literally be the scariest thing. It’s been ages since I had one but from what I remember it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and my body would shake and I would get the worst tingling in my stomach. This one would come on randomly, like when riding a bike with a friend or walking home.Which one sounds more like a panic attack to you?  [info] None [info] 1534488980 [info] test

Zaitlinspf [info] How did yall push past your anxiety to be able to talk to new people? Currently a college freshman and struggling with making friends. I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was 5 but my family never really did much besides tell me I was just being being anxious and needed to get over my shyness. (Family is better about mental health though as I've gotren older).I had a hard time in highschool making friends till highschool where I found my clique and we all stuck together. Now I'm on my own and have 1 new friend and 1 from my highschool. I try to talk to people in class but feel myself hold back as I feel like the person isn't interested or feel like I talked to much or that they think I'm weird. I also started catching that I lightly stutter or slur my words now and I have no idea how that started or how to make it stop. And I just feel like I'm holding myself back from something so easy. I really want to meet new people so I've tried to join clubs and just didn't like the vibe of the groups. I'm now trying to talk to classmates to try and make a friend. But I suck at keeping a conversation going without feeling weird and anxious.How did yall get over your social anxiety? Or at least push through it? Any tips to stop feeling like the other person isn't intrested/bored when they aren't? [info] None [info] 1582007589 [info] test
alexaplaydespacito2 [info] frock no. 6th grade year I got A’s in almost all subjects except for math. I understood the math but I just got all C’s and the rare B. It made some really angry because I knew I couldn’t pass if I kept this up. My teacher pulled me over and gave me an oral test which I got 100% on. I was diagnosed with anxiety that year.

roxychick4327 [info] I am on the verge of making a big move myself (although not quite as far) as well as starting a new job. I also have a 7 year old who is making this move with me and I fear repercussions of it not working out so much. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I know the feeling. Every day the move draws nearer I need to talk myself out of talking myself out of it all. For every negative, anxiety filled thought I remind myself of something in my current life I want to be different and how this move is going to help me accomplish that. I never let myself dwell in fear too long if I can help it. Sometimes I fail, but sometimes I succeed. Make a list of pros. Refer back to it when you get scared. Immediately following every scared thought with a small positive is something I've tried to train myself to do. Honestly, sometimes it's the little things like I think about how my new apartment has a fireplace and I've always wanted a fireplace. It sounds so juvenile, but it works. Think about how no real reward comes without risk. The discomfort of the move is only temporary. Your new definition of normal will set in. All of us have the ability to adapt. I would hate to think that you or I didn't succeed just because we were too scared to try. [info] None [info] 1452932222 [info] test
_robynn_ [info] :( I’m so sorry. I didn’t know I was being cruel or that I was hurting you. I just honestly thought that when you said appointment you actually meant an appointment. I didn’t know you didn’t mean what you said. I saw how you got angry and it really does scare me. I don’t feel safe when you’re mad. Sofia was also very scared when you were hitting things with the frying pan. She is too young to understand that you have problems and she blames herself for you being mad. I blame myself for you being mad too, but I know it is my fault. The reason I don’t like getting close to people is because you have convinced me that I’m a terrible person. I care too much about people to get close to them because I’m convinced that I’m a terrible person and no one would ever want to be my friend. You called me cruel for not understanding that when you said “appointment” you actually meant “performance.” I know it’s my fault so please stop yelling and hitting me. It really hurts. Even though I am diagnosed with anxiety you are convinced that I don’t have it so I stopped taking my medicine because if I don’t have it I wouldn’t need my medicine. My anxiety has gotten so much worse because I’m not taking my medicine but I know that I’m faking it so I’ll just deal with it. I’m a pathetic human. I’m sorry I’m not able to help you with shopping and I’m sorry I waste your time because you have to pick me up from school. I know that I’m a burden and that I would be better off dead, please stop reminding me. I know I deserve all of this for coming into your life and costing you a lot of medical bills. I know you want me to die but I’m too scared and selfish to go through another suicide attempt. I know that makes me pathetic. I know I’m worthless. Please please please please stop hurting me.

germanshredder [info] I am very new to all of this and don't understand much. Two years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety. I took meds and did the therapy. Now I take Ativan just as needed and learned to manage to anxiety most days. I am so confused since being diagnosed with ADHD. A lot of the symptoms for adhd, I feel like go for anxiety. I felt like a lot of my issues were caused by misunderstanding my triggers. Now I feel like I'm starting over again. I didn't really believe I had adhd until my Dr (he is amazing) prescribed adderall and I took it to see if it would help anything. I took it as directed and it hit me like a ton of bricks. What I thought were anxious thoughts all went quiet and I feel calm enough to sleep for days. I did actually have to go lay down for a bit because of it. I'm hoping that part evens out. I'm still sorting through all of the info so any advice, experiences, or general words of wisdom would be appreciated. [info] None [info] 1469165729 [info] test
LushEnough [info] Hey! Me and my partner used to only trip together, but I’ve been solo tripping for a year now. I have been diagnosed with anxiety since elementary school. I won’t lie to you I’ve had a few trips where I got a little uneasy at times but it’s nothing a good distraction won’t fix lol. Find yourself some good shit to watch on tv, or get some various arts and crafts to do, music is also a must. Solo tripping is very rewarding. You’ll be fine :-) I took 200ug about 20 minutes ago so here I go again! [info] None [info] 1561086866 [info] test
TalkOfSexualPleasure [info] Personally I'm diagnosed with anxiety.  I'm very particular with who I tell that to (barring Reddit because of the anonymity) because if I feel like people are patronizing me it makes my anxiety worse.  There are some people who push the envelope for no other reason than attention, but grouping all of us into that category really hurts the ones of us who suffer silently to ourselves.  I personally have the fear of telling someone about my condition and being told they know better than my doctor's or told I'm out right lying, because my symptoms aren't visible, but personally my symptoms don't come out around anyone, they're clawing at the back of my mind, but in front of people my mind goes into go mode and decides no one can see how dysfunctional I am.  The muscles in my back will clench to the point of pain, my shoulders will cramp, and I can be all but having panic attack and yet I won't break.  The second I'm by myself, I can't breath, I can't think, I'm pacing, yanking at my hair, screaming, crying, and even praying to a god I don't believe in to make it stop.  And it never stops, it never goes away, it gets better, smaller, for at least a little while, but it never ever goes away. [info] None [info] 1552359370 [info] test
chelbren [info] Yes, yes, yes. I always thought I was just a massive bitch, but then I was diagnosed with anxiety and it made so much sense. It's honestly the most frustrating part of anxiety for me.
