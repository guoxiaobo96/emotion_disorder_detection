gabez814 [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety, I'm hoping to find a physician who agrees its "similar" to PTSD because like you said based on the wording it definitely sounds like its up to the physicians. [info] None [info] 1478738886
PatronymicPenguin [info] It's too easy to give up after the first medication or two doesn't work well. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder as a child and it took several months to find a medication which worked and didn't have unbearable side effects, but it was worth it. My life improved greatly and has continued to get better into adulthood. It can take time, but never give up. The right medicine, combined with therapy, can change your life.

abdane [info] Anxiety symptoms, anyone share this? okay so I have been diagnosed with anxiety since 2015 when I had a panic attack out of nowhere, i thought i was done for and this will be my life forever. I went to see a doctor and was saved by benzos (ativan at the time). Then i went on cipralex for about a year and stopped it because it made me very tired most of the time. I thought the panic attacks would reoccur, but they didnt thank god. Now, my daily life is as follow:&amp;#x200B;waking up fine, one hour later my anxiety starts to rise (not sure if its anxiety or what at this point), what I feel is a weird feeling that I cannot explain, ill try my best. i dont get any physical symptoms that the rest get (heavy breathing, sweating, etc...) all what i feel is this feeling in my brain of un-focusness and it is very uncomfortable to bare. I came across brain-fog but im not sure if that is what im experiencing or not. its like my brain is not mentally clear and I cannot focus, but i can if i want to but its hard. as i said, hard to explain. But during the evening (8pm or so for some weird reason) the effects subside and i fell a bit more normal.&amp;#x200B;then the cycle goes again on the next day. some days i do not experience this (which is rare, maybe once a month).&amp;#x200B;Anyone else with same experience? any advice?

KatillacGirl [info] Thank you, I was diagnosed with anxiety at the same age as you, and this feels very different.  I do know that anxiety can morph itself to latch on to you too though!  I am really glad that I finally have a doctor who takes my concerns seriously and checks for things now.  My initial doctor would literally tell me EVERYTHING was anxiety.  I am very thin, (in fact underweight), but I have never been a super active person, so sometimes I think I'm just very out of shape.  But then I see other people who are wayyy more out of shape than I am, and they can still do things MUCH more easily, without feeling like they are going to die. :/I've noticed for me, that I push myself too hard when I feel good, because I actually hate sitting still, and then I am tuckered out for days at times.   I need about 10 hours of sleep a night, any less = Pain.  Too much = Pain + Anxiety.  I don't know why that is.  I'm still feeling super skeptical about whether I have fibro or not.  I feel like I might almost doubt it if my doctor tells me I have it, even though I relate so so much to the condition. [info] None [info] 1528903029
Caffeinated_DaVinic [info] Yeah same. I have access to it legally for real cheap though only temporarily. Asking everywhere I can for any info on it. I've had my fair share of bad trips and immediately thought to use it as a backup Benzo since my doctor won't prescribe me Xanax anymore after I told him I smoke. I mean I've been diagnosed with anxiety and sleep disorders since I was 9 but now the only med I've been prescribed my entire life that works is taken away just because I care about drug interactions... Gave me something else for anxiety but leaves me with HUGE memory gaps, like hours I just can't recall at all. [info] None [info] 1513901221

WallFlower556 [info] Hands tingling? Hey guys, so today my landlord and her husband showed up to my apartment unannounced without and notice and began pounding on both my front door and back door at the same time, they began trying to get in, and looking through my windows to see if I had packed anything (I’m supposed to be out at the end of the month because of our agreement and me trying to leave because this isn’t the first time they have harassed me) their reason being because I haven’t answered their calls of her trying to see if I am all packed up because I was busy packing. Anyway I had heart palpitations galore as I called the police, and my hands started tingling. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD because of past trauma, but the hands tingling was a new one and I didn’t know if anyone else has experienced something like this before. I also have carpal tunnel, but it wasn’t the normal kind of flare up it happened when I started getting anxious, but I’m not sure if that’s a factor? Anyway thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope everyone is doing well. If you ever need someone to talk to and listen I am here for all of you! [info] None [info] 1577575637
weakandbroken [info] What are the odds of having a PE (or anything else for that matter) that doesn't show up on EKG? 20 year old male, 240 pounds, 6 foot 2. I've been having breathing problems and chest pain for the last 24 hours give or take a few. I don't drink and I only smoke once a year at the very most but I do get a lot of secondhand exposure.. No diagnosed medical conditions, and the only things I take for medication are lorazepam (rarely, as needed) and CoQ10 (OTC, not by recommendation or anything). I called the ambulance around 4 AM yesterday, they did a 4 lead EKG, and everything showed up fine so I went home. Symptoms persisted so I went to the walk-in clinic around 11 AM later that day, and they did a 12 lead and everything showed up fine. There must have been some sort of argument between the doctor I saw or someone else because he was really adamant that I go up to the ER to get bloodwork done, but then the other nurse came in and told me since the EKG was fine (save for low T-wave in V6 and sinus arrhythmia, but this was just what the machine automatically detected, not the technician). I got home and got in the shower and came *very* close to fainting, and symptoms got worse so I got up to the ER and because I already had an EKG done, they just took my vitals then discharged me. Around 5 this morning the symptoms were even worse, called the ambulance, they did another 4 lead, and everything showed up fine. Now I'm lying in bed and my symptoms are the worst they've ever been. I would go up to the ER again but chances are they won't believe me, since I have been diagnosed with anxiety and have had a few false alarms (even though I know for a fact it's not anxiety.) Anyway I am really concerned about PE. I have been fairly immobile for a whole week up until Tuesday, and for that whole week my diet was "lacking" to say the least.Sorry if I'm rambling at this point. But my question is whether or not PE can be ruled out by EKG alone, and if it can't, how do I go about them testing for troponin or whatever else? [info] None [info] 1530211538
Rokelu [info] Possible sleep apnea. Yet to be tested Hello, I am a 23 year old male standing at 6’1 and weighing about 270 pounds. I have made a decision to make great changes to my lifestyle in order to lose weight and be healthier. I am from Ohio and I just recently graduated from college. During college, I gained about 60-65 pounds. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I take Zoloft (I haven’t in about a week due to running out and being on vacation.) recently, I have been having issues with sleep, and I don’t feel tired during the day, but I don’t feel well-rested either. Late last week, I woke up holding my breath(this was after drinking a bit too much wine, I haven’t drank since because I’m trying to cut alcohol out.) It was very subtle but it was odd; something I have never experienced before. I have been told I snore quite loudly by family, but no one has ever noted disruptions in breathing. I have also been having strange and vivid dreams at night. Nothing that wakes me up, but something I remember which could be attributed to my melatonin use as well. Last time I went to the doctor, I was pre hypertensive, but my doc decided not to do anything medication wise. I recently downloaded a sleep app and it recorded a 4 minute clip of my sleeping. I didn’t really hear any breath or snoring due to the noise of my fan, but I did hear myself make a sort of gasping noise 1-2 times during the clip. I also have very bad allergies and have trouble breathing clearly through my nose. My heart-rate according to my Apple Watch has been around 50 for me recently, which is somewhat low compared to my usual low to mid 60’s or even around 70bpm. I usually feel refreshed immediately after waking. I have also been feeling groggy early to mid afternoon, and I feel as if I get tired easily during physical exercise. This isn’t like an out of breath tired, but more like a sleepy tired. I don’t feel as if I have classic symptoms such as throat pain or headaches when waking up, but I do tend to have head pressure throughout the day. I also wear a mouthguard during sleep to prevent teeth grinding, which I do quite often. With all of this being said, I plan on seeing the doctor, but should I be very concerned given my age and plans to make changes to be much healthier? Any advice would be very helpful.

azumatora [info] I didn't realize that drug testing had been implemented.So (and this is me trying to think out loud) if I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder and changed doctors after getting out of the hospital, I would have to be drug tested before I could get an anxiety med? Wow. (Or rather "any future", since this would be after the mental hospital's prescription ran out.)***If your next response is, "Yes, if anxiety meds are controlled substances."Then I'll jump in with, "Most are.

Servalpur [info] You're right, I didn't word that correctly at all. Where I said "sane", I should have said "capable". Generally when people hear the phrase mental illness, they automatically link to the capability of the person. I'm guilty of it too, even though I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorders, a form of mental illness.That said, my point was that if this witch was capable of producing a potion or spell which could bend the will of someone to fit her wishes, she was also capable of creating some kind of life for herself and her son.

emheybug [info] Obsessive thoughts/ I've been diagnosed with anxiety pretty much my whole life. Back in February I had 3 days of the worst panic attacks of my life and then I started obsessively thinking that I was being spiritually attacked by the devil for about 12 days. I literally was getting sick, throwing up, not eating, etc. I had relief for about a month and then it started up again. It has gotten to the point where I was having intrusive thoughts about killing myself and feeling as if I am fighting my brain. I'm not sure if this is OCD or not. I see a doctor and she said it's possible, but there's no real clarification from her. (just my primary care doctor)She put me on Zoloft and I've been taking it for about a month. I upped to 50mg around 2 weeks ago. I see some improvement with my thoughts (no longer thinking about harming myself) but I'm still obsessing over the devil + God. Anyone here take Zoloft and does it help with your unwanted thoughts? [info] None [info] 1555697180

Elenorelore [info] I don't know if this helps any, but I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder every three years since the fourth grade (I'm a junior in college now). I've frequently had moments where I've heard phone rings, wake-up alarms, etcetera when nothing was going on. Heck, I used to always have my phone on vibrate and started getting phantom phone vibrations  that I could've sworn were real. When I got my first apartment, there was a couple of times throughout my lease that I felt as if someone was in my apartment. I'd get out of bed just to check everywhere. I'd even slept with all of the lights on so that I could see anyone if they were coming (not every time, but a few times). Schizophrenia is a common illness in my family so I've also became immensly worried that I was in the early stages-- but I think that's just what anxiety does to you. Sometimes I'd think that I was seeing things outta the corner of my eye, then I'd just psych myself out for the rest of the day because of it.Now that I'm on medication for anxiety, all of those feelings have gone away.

apiaries [info] Exciting to see all of these new farms popping up! I haven’t been able to try a more “premium” CBD product and I would love to evaluate what a quality product does for me. I am diagnosed with anxiety due to some complex traumas and even low dose CBD helps with it, along with some chronic physical pain that I have from a wrist surgery and Lyme Disease hip injury (which I start PT for tomorrow!). It also helps settle things if my GERD kicks in. CBD allows me to stand for shifts at work, something that is agonizing if not impossible without, along with being able to enjoy my day. I’m not interested in opioids or pharmaceutical muscle relaxers, the former because of the side effects and ridiculous abuse potential and the latter because they don’t work for me. As far as anxiety goes, I would say that being able to control my disordered eating (binging) changed my entire life... I lost weight, am in less pain because I am now a healthy weight, feel more confident about my body, and am just living a healthier and better life. I’d love to try your product! I’m starting my senior year as a Mass Communication student in one week and I’m curious to see how my semester could be improved with less anxiety and more focus! [info] None [info] 1566233157
snowcroc [info] Medicine making symptoms better but causing excessive burping. So here is the story.It started when I was conscripted into the army, I lost a ton of weight and became fitter and then the constipation started. It was bad.At first I went to GPs but they just gave me probiotics and laxatives, none of which really worked. So I went to a specialist who after a round of medicines that did not work sent me to get a colonoscopy and a endoscopy. Both came out clean.He then put me on some probiotics and tirmebutine malate. This did improve the symptoms somewhat, although not perfect, I do tend to have more regular and easier to pass bowel movement. Although it still feels like an incomplete evacuation.However, it feels like this is causing me excessive gas. Sometimes I do feel bloated, but even if I am not, I am constantly burping. I have this uncomfortable feeling of trapped air below my sternum and keep burping. Like 5 time a minute for the whole day. I am not exaggerating at all.Some things you may want to know.I generally have lousy sleep because I am a guard in the army and have to do four hour shifts round the clock.I eat healthy and maintain an active lifestyle.I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 17, but had no symptoms then.

NudePenguin69 [info] Mine is more of a personal one rather than song meaning specific.Twice's Fancy came out the day after my first ever panic attack sent me to the emergency room for 14 hours.  I got home at 4am from the hospital and was physically and emotionally exhausted but I stayed awake because I knew the new Twice song was about to drop.  I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder shortly after that, and for a while, I couldnt listen to Fancy because it triggered memories and feelings from that night that flared up my anxiety. Recently however, now that my anxiety is well regulated by medication and I am half a year removed from the incident, Fancy has become a song that reminds me of what I overcame.  My struggles with anxiety earlier in the year were the scariest thing I have personally endured in my life, and Fancy reminds me the no matter how shitty things seem, life goes on and it will soon pass.

yaen [info] Exactly. I used it for anxiety pre-preg, but I quit when I got pregnant. When people hear 'I used it for anxiety,' I wonder if they think I got a little anxious now and then and used it as an excuse. No. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, and panic disorder. It's terrifying and dibilitating when it's bad.Fortunately, I'm a lucky person for whom pregnancy hormones have helped me feel the least anxiety I've felt in years. But I fear for what will happen after the birth, with my hormones going crazy. It's still my goal to manage my anxiety with no drugs of any kind, but when it comes down to it, if I need something, I'd 100% choose smoking a tiny bit a couple times a week rather than starting a crazy SSRI regimen and having to quit breast feeding. That sounds both worse for me and the baby. I've been on almost every anti-depressant out there over my lifetime, and I'm never happy on them. I don't just feel numb with cannabis, I feel happy. That is to say, during the periods when Im not actually high, I find myself happier and more calm. I'm grateful for it.

Possant [info] My Grandparents Have Been Frustrating Me A Little Too Much Disclaimer: My English is kinda bad, so sorry for any mistakes.So, I didn't know if I should post this here, because I'm very anxious and I was afraid of the answers, but here goes nothing.I've been living with my grandparents for more than a year, my mother lives in another city and I decided to live with them, because I love the city that they live.So the first thing is that my grandmother doesn't quite understand the problems that I have, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and Panic Syndrome, I have been going to a psychologist and lately I was getting some good results. But my grandmother is always asking about my problems, and I know she really wants to help, but her answers are always like “This is only happening in your head” or “People won't bite you”, whenever I'm discussing this with her is always a headache and I always get kind of frustrated, but I really don't want to give a rude answer, because I don't want to make her sad and my conscience gets really heavy.Another thing that bothers me a little too much is my grandfather, his always entering my room, and trying to be funny in a forced way and trying to make me laugh, sometimes I do laugh, but recently it has been frustrating me more and more. And sometimes I only want to be alone with my thoughts or read a book and I have to pass the stress of asking him politely to give me some space, but he is really persistent on doing it and sometimes he can't see that I want a time with only myself. I've been trying to be nicest person ever lately, and this kind of things have been making me really stressed, I don't want to discount on my parents or friends, I really want it to go away but I don't know how, and I’ve been really getting frustrated with this. I'm kinda young, I'm only 14 years old and I have to confess that I was a little spoiled. I really want to make things easy for me and for them. [info] None [info] 1539461551

flperson [info] 6 months is not excessive time to try out a new treatment for anxiety.I have been diagnosed with anxiety by a few different Dr.s over the years and trying CBD oil is the only time I have self treated with something that is not a prescription.I've talked to many doctors, I cannot afford one currently.We are having this conversation because you don't know what you're talking about and hopefully my explanations and experiences can help someone..."Get some medicaid/Medicare... It's pretty much free if he's actually broke."  I hope this comment is just you being silly or sarcastic or something... Getting useful coverage through the gov't is not easy in any way. My wife and I and one child had a household income last year of $24,000 before taxes. This gets me "medically necessary" coverage through medicare which is only good for emergency services above a certain amount. (I believe this is $5000, but am not sure ). That's it. There are county/state programs and income based fee services, which I have tried in the past, but they are another story in itself. Right now CBD is something that a bunch of people are having great results with and I thought I would try it out since I don't need a prescription and the possible side effects are negligible. That's pretty much it... [info] None [info] 1549300829

Meanwhile, her brother and I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorders since we were children and had to learn to actually manage our disorders in order to live productive lives.

meerkatmeow [info] Any suggestions on how I can make myself feel more “bridal”? I’ve typed this out a few times and haven’t been able to make it flow, so I apologize if it doesn’t make sense. I went wedding dress shopping over the weekend and have felt very down since. I had to go alone, as I currently live in South Carolina and my family and friends are in Massachusetts. What I always thought would be a magical experience left me exhausted and feeling pathetic. I found myself angry and envious of the other brides who were having a great time with their loved ones. I realized after my 10th dress that I only felt like some ugly loser playing dress up and not like a bride. On Monday I told my coworkers that I had gone dress shopping, hoping maybe they’d be excited, but they didn’t respond too well. Granted, I work with all dudes and shouldn’t have expected much excitement, but it still hurt a bit. I’ve also heard through my best friend who’s helping plan my bachelorette party that most of our friends are less than enthusiastic about attending. They all have a million excuses and two of them straight up didn’t respond to the invite. We even changed the location from Napa Valley where I want to go, to somewhere closer to home in hopes they’ll attend. I’m still excited, but it’s frustrating that they have such little interest in celebrating with me. I’ve also found it difficult being so far from our families while wedding planning. We only hear their excitement through the phone and text, but not hearing in person makes it feel less genuine. Of course they’re all excited, the distance just mutes it. We are moving back home in March, which should help ease my worries, but it’s currently adding another layer of stress to wedding planning. We have to find an apartment, I have to find a job, and moving is just super stressful. This turned more into a rant than a question. I guess I would ask - how do you all make yourselves feel bridal? When did you start feeling it? Are my feelings normal? I should also add that I was diagnosed with anxiety in August. My doctor suggested two therapists to speak with, however they never returned my calls. I know I should see someone, but it may have to wait until the move. If you made it this far, thank you. I appreciate it more than you know. TLDR: I’m stressed and anxious looking for advice on how to relax and start feeling like a bride. [info] None [info] 1548258726
princessblueberry [info] Borderlands 2 is helping my anxiety! I’ve never really been one to get into games but when I got into a new relationship with yet another gamer, I knew I couldn’t go back to my old ways like I was with my ex. I took him away from his games and never attempted to try them myself, a massive mistake that I regret and I didn’t want to make again so, when my boyfriend asked if I wanted to try Borderlands 2 with him, I gave it a go. I should note that I’ve never really played Xbox before, so this was a first. I was diagnosed with anxiety 8 years ago and within the last 2 years I’ve been on a massive decline with it and the beginning to this game I was very rocky. Enemies jumping out and having no concept of how to work the controller or play in a first person shooter view shook me, sometimes even gave me small anxiety attacks, to which I had to stop playing to calm down, this went on for a while but 4 weeks later, I find that it’s helping me deal with last minute changes and just general small things in my life as well as helping me be less shit in the game! I got my tax return and the first thing I did was preorder Borderlands 3: Super Deluxe Edition for my boyfriend. Any other games, totally unrelated to Borderlands, that anyone thinks I should try? Again - I’ve never been big on games, but with Borderlands I still can’t play it alone. Looking for suggestions on games I can play some while my boyfriend is at work and I’m recovering a spinal injury! Thanks!** EDIT ** I just really really wanna thank everyone for being so nice! Not that I expected everyone to attack me, but the anxiety of being called names for knowing absolutely nothing about games did cross my mind but everyone’s comments so far have made me feel so welcomed into the world of gaming so thank you!

MoiraVonTeese [info] Does this make me mentally unstable/ill? First of all, I'm pretty sure it does. I guess it's just kinda hard to admit it to myself, so, here's my question.I'm almost 16 years old. A week ago, I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and anger issues.I didn't get any medication because my clinical psychologist said that she thinks it's not that bad, and I'm young so it would be bad for me to start with it so early (I do believe her, at least for the first part because I know people who have much more severe anxiety than me).I've been through a lot in my life. Don't come at me with "you're only 16 what do you know about life". You don't know stuff that happened so please consider that.I'd just like to know, does having these two diagnoses make me mentally ill? Unstable? Thanks [info] None [info] 1538683323
IndividualSchedule [info] Good point. I wish people would recognize it more and don’t potentially and maybe unintentionally normalize social anxiety. Me being introvert, I was diagnosed with anxiety and symptoms of social phobia years ago (along some other mental illnesses).Now I really struggle to recognize if it’s me being introverted or me being symptomatic. And it’s so hard to live like this. Sometimes I know when it’s symptoms of social anxiety and when it’s being introverted.And I really wish more people with potential social anxiety would rather seek help than just say “oh I’m introvert, I’d rather stay alone.” it just deepens the social anxiety. In both cases it’s important to get out of our comfort zone, get nice doze of social interaction and then recharge and do it again. Of course social interactions with rather positive energy.

pkafan4lyfe [info] Does anyone have any experience with getting prescriptions via tele-health visits? As a child I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and as I grew up I was able to find ways to cope and manage it all on my own. However, with this global pandemic going on I am starting to relapse it seems in terms of my anxiety. It’s getting to the point where the worry of what is going to happen to my loved ones consumes my mind for entire days. At this point I feel like it’s time to talk to my doctor about some sort of temporary treatment but my primary physicians office is shut down for non essential appointments until further notice?

ilovjedi [info] I’m a 32 year old woman with a 10 year old son we both officially have ADHD. We’re going to get my son started on meds this year. I worry about him taking them because he seems so little but the impact of his hyperactivity at school is noticeable and it makes it hard for him to learn.I was diagnosed with anxiety before I was diagnosed with ADHD both were diagnosed as an adult. Anxiety symptoms and ADHD symptoms can overlap so maybe it would make sense to talk to your daughters doctor about maybe treating her anxiety and seeing if that makes her school problems a little better too. You can also have both. And, would she benefit from talking with a counselor about the anxiety? They have play therapy for younger kids. Also, at school if you’re in the US have you asked for an IEP?I was taking 15 MG of XR Adderall before I became pregnant. I went down from 20 MG because it was too much and kept me from sleeping.

RxWest [info] Can anxiety lower your IQ? Or does it just lower your test-taking abilities? Throughout my childhood, I was diagnosed with anxiety, and anxiety induced panic attacks. Heavily depressed, I was always in and out of psychologists’ offices. One day, when I was about 16, they had me take an IQ test. I scored a 108. I pretty much averaged a C grade average throughout school, except for math. In mathematics, I always had an F-D grade average.Anyways, I have been free of panic attacks for almost half a year now. I went back to my neuro-psych’s office and retook the test. I scored a 130. Note, this was not the exact same test, but it was of similar variety. Ever since my anxiety has gone away, I’ve been able to grasp concepts much easier than before.  I’m in 3x accelerated calc courses, and even have a 3.7 gpa majoring in Computer Science...I know that your IQ score can’t really increase. So, I’m puzzled as to why the big jump occurred.TL;DRHad anxiety. Scored low on IQ test. No more anxiety, excelling in school, and now scored a 130 IQ. [info] None [info] 1561089117

I can never seem to be able to be able to finish anything or i get frustrated with the smallest of things . Like today for example i found a nice vocal sample That i wanted to use and warped it on ableton . It sounded in time with the metronome but i felt it just didn't sound right and i even checked it on other programs like the Fl Studio demo or mixed in key  .It made me feel disheartend and just close ableton and stop trying to fix it  . I don't know, i even  try to force my self but i can't  do anything with my music , I set deadlines i don't reach them, I take breaks it dosn't work .

ouiserboudreauxxx [info] I hear you completely. I've been in therapy for awhile and realized how messed up my childhood was through that.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on anti-depressants, and they just made me apathetic. I was on them in college for about a year as well and that was my absolute worst year academically. I got a new therapist last year and she is the one who finally suggested ADHD and then referred me to a new doctor.I agree with you that I too think my problems are greater than just ADHD(even though honestly I don't think anyone really understands 'adhd' very well) but for me the ADHD meds help me so much that I don't really care what label they want to put on it. Definitely don't give up on yourself! You're more proactive than I was back then. Aside from being on meds in college for a bit, I didn't pursue therapy or other treatment until I was 29.

eisenkatze [info] Is this a panic attack? I've been diagnosed with anxiety and other stuff for ages but never experienced something like this. My grandmother died a month ago today, I watched her die which didn't seem to faze me. During the funeral, I kept feeling sick and nauseous, and in the viewing hall, suddenly started breathing very heavily and felt I was going to faint, my entire body went numb. I was ill for a long while afterwards, thinking it was pneumonia as I was short of breath and my heart wouldn't stop beating fast for days, but turned out to be psychosomatic after running some tests.Today I visited her grave for the first time since the funeral. Again, I couldn't help but start hyperventilating and stumbled down onto a bench, completely numb and nauseous. It felt like I didn't have any air at all. When my mom came to join me, I could function as normal, however.When I told a psychiatrist about the first instance, he said this was an "incomplete" panic attack. What makes it incomplete and what is a "normal" panic attack like? I've read up about them extensively for years but never had one, so no idea what it feels like. Is this a normal psychosomatic response to repressed emotions? I really don't want to visit her grave again, or go to the church service in her memory, in case this happens again.

Well because of Covid, idk if in school will be a thing and i'm super anxious that i'll be in my room isolated for a year. I was diagnosed with anxiety about three years ago.However, I also don't want to sit around at my parents home for a year because my dad isn't the best person and he makes my anxiety worse.So, I plan to move and just have a room near campus and focus (as much as possible) on school. But rverything about my future and Covid scares me. I want to make friends but if campus is closed I don't see how i'll do that. But I also do not want to put off continuing my studies because I'm already going to be spending an additional 3 years ( i can make it two if i fast track) at University on top of the three at collegeHaving anxiety plus the uncertainty of Covid sucks :( [info] None [info] 1587084912
Stat-Lord [info] AITA For snapping at my family over a joke A few days ago, I snapped at my mum and my sister. Not like, a small snide comment. I, for lack of a better term, erupted. It all started in 4th grade when I was diagnosed with anxiety, specifically, around the concept of death. I literally couldn't be in the dark because it would make me imagine how permanent death is and how immanent it is for everyone. Around this time my mum and sister had learned that a song they both really enjoyed, which was solely based around the inevitability of death, would send me into a meltdown. Looking back, it was actually causing me to have a panic attack. But my family kept playing it, because they KNEW it would upset me and they thought it was hilarious. They both knew I had anxiety but they didn't understand just how terrible it felt for me to be stuck in tears in the back of the car whilst they sung it out loud on purpose. Fast forward a couple of years and they both recall the song whilst cleaning through some old CD's in the garage. They bring the song up with me in a joking manner. Talking about how terrified I used to be of a little harmless song. I told them I didn't find it funny, that they knew I had anxiety. They scoffed and told me to toughen up. That's when I snapped, I flew off the handle and told them how much I still resent them both for putting me through that when I was just a child. It went back and forth for over an hour before mum called me some choice expletives and told me to fuck off. I'm writing this from my friends place and my family isn't letting me go home until I apologise, but I'll be damned before I apologise for anything that I said. [info] None [info] 1551523581
atomickate [info] Just coming back from one of the worst migraines I've had in a long time... The only upside is that it didn't last *super* long. About 8 hours ago, I had to leave work early because I lost vision in my left eye. It was making me extremely nauseous. My fiance picked me up, and I came home, got sick, and took a dose of Maxalt (a triptan-seratonin agonist). This medication makes me feel really weird and I passed out for about 15 minutes. I wake up and begin getting sick again. I take a dose of excedrin as my doctor has told me I can do. I get sick again. I decide to get in the shower to relax and that helps a little. After two hours and no *real* progress, I take another dose of Maxalt. At this point, I'm hungry and very nauseous...so as I'm thinking about food, I'm also making myself feel even more sick. FINALLY after 4 hours, I pass out on the couch. After sleepng for another 4 hours, I feel almost perfect. I say almost because now its 2:30 am, I'm wide awake, and have nothing to do! (lol)The one thing I have taken away from the last 8 hours is that I now know that my body nearly hates that Maxalt. It obviously works (even a little), and that is good, but my body has not fought that hard against a medication in a long time. I could feel the medicine working - I felt very light and my legs felt really good, but my body almost felt heavy and very shakey. This has only ever happened when I've had to take laughing gas when my wisdom teeth were removed. Now, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I'm sure that it definitely has a part in this.Does anyone else have this issue - where your body fights against the helpful parts of your medicine? How do you tell your body to basically shut up and let the medicine work? [info] None [info] 1377325685
oneeyedpete94 [info] My fiancé (F 23) doesn’t know if she wants us to be together or not despite loving me (M 23). Everything went downhill so fast. Yesterday she kissed someone else (M 21/2?) This is a little bit long, but I *really* need help.We’ve been together for almost 7 years, engaged for almost 3 years and are meant to be getting married in May.  Everything seemed okay, we weren’t behaving abnormally or anything - still talking, bickering, having sex, flirting, doing the cute little things that get overlooked.  Then a couple of weeks ago, we had an argument about nothing, and spent a good few hours jokingly arguing about breaking up.  The week after, she told me that she’s not been able to stop thinking about breaking up and needed some time, so I went to my family for the week to give it her.  I came back 2 days ago and she still has no idea, except now she won’t act like a couple with me.  We’re talking as normal, she’s saying I love you before she leaves for somewhere, but not cuddling, kissing and certainly so sign of sex so far.She doesn’t want to talk because she doesn’t know the answers. But I know one of the problems is us not doing things out of the house more. We do things, but the last few months we’ve mainly been inside, she had a fall out with her friends so it’s mainly just been me and her.  I know this is a problem, I was diagnosed with anxiety problems in 2013, and have “overcome” them pretty much now but they still effect me with new/bigger things so sometimes my old habits make me put off doing things.  I’ve told her I’d changed, gave her options of a place to start by going on holiday but she thinks it’s for the wrong reasons even though I’ve explicitly explained that I *want* to do these things, I want to experience life with her, just sometimes need a push.  I think she knows that, though, because she really gets my anxiety and me usually.She also said she thinks we’ve have no spark, although I disagree.  We make each other laugh a lot, when we’re flirting before sex it’s like we’re lighting a fire, and our conversation just clicks usually. Now I just feel like I’m on eggshells.There’s been a guy flirting with her since Christmas at work - like heavily flirting and she said he was just a flirty person and she likes attention so it didn’t bother me. However, then she said she liked him a little - crush level like -  but again, fine.  We’re human, liking/fancying people is natural.  However, the night I got home, he kissed her and she kissed back multiple times.  She refused sex with him and has said she doesn’t know what it means. I’m more bothered that she’s refusing to kiss or cuddle me. Albeit she was drunk that night.She also has no idea what to do with her life and she feels lost besides our relationship. I’m worried she’s doing all of this in the hope it’ll change life, when obviously our relationship doesn’t restrict that. But I don’t if she can see that.Finally, this is unlike her.  She’s not open with everyone, she’s very closed off with everyone but me.  But if I’ve ever been upset, she’s cared and comforted like you’d expect, however, I was talking about us and have cried, and I talked about my mental health issues and cried and she didn’t really flinch.  Normally, she’d be supportive.We’re graduating this year, we’ve got a wedding, we’ve both had big family issues in the past 2 months, she fell out with her friends and we’ve not done much. I feel like this is just a really bad rough patch merging from lots of little things.  We were happy 3 weeks ago, she said it wasn’t until that initial conversation she’d not even thought about it.  We were still buying wedding things, just before Christmas we were doing big organisation stuff - I don’t understand why doubts wouldn’t have rises then.  I’m lost on what to do because I think the only thing that will fix this is us behaving as normal (with extra effort and improvements) to show that’s we’re good and happy. But she said even if I offered her a 100% solution she doesn’t know if she’d take it.I’m not willing to just throw away 7 years over a kiss or anything. What do I do?  How do I approach this without pushing her further away?*edit* - If it wasn’t for the kiss , would you view it any differently?*edit #2* - The guy means more than she initially said.  We’ve solved every problem except for him. I’ve told her that she’s gotta have to get over one of us, and even if she hated my guts and didn’t love me, getting over 7 years is going to be harder than getting over 2 months [info] None [info] 1517306199
I_Am_Echo [info] Too Afraid To Talk To Friends. How Have Y'all Handled This? Hello everyone, quick about me, I guess. I was diagnosed with anxiety about two years ago and am on medication and working with a therapist. I have made lots of progress! But there are still some issues that I can't overcome just yet. For example, I have been living with my roommates for about two years now. We are all pretty close. And I am afraid of engaging with them socially one on one. I have had deep, meaningful conversations with them when we are in a group, but the idea of hanging out with them one on one scares the living hell out of me. My therapist and I are working on it. She has told me to try making myself more vulnerable and reminding myself that awkward won't kill me. So I've begun hanging out with them if they are playing video games to watch them and stuff like that. And it's slowly helping. But the main issue that I realized is affecting my life just happen ten minutes before I posted this. One of the people in our social group that see occasionally, not exactly a friend, but more than an acquaintance, just messaged me on social media making a playful and friendly joke about something I had just posted. I fucking froze at work. I typed a funny banter reply.And immediately closed out of the social media. With thoughts like, "Oh god, what do I do?" "I'll say something to make him feel uncomfortable." "Oh god, why is he messaging me??" It was like I was being interrogated for murder and not a casual friend making a joke. This is not normal. I literally cannot talk to friends. I am too afraid to reopen social media to check the reply.How do other people handle this issue? I will bring it up with my therapist, but I just want to not feel alone in my weird issue.

kiosk68 [info] Yes!! The same exact thing happened to me. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I told my doctor all of my symptoms and he suggested “meditation” which was bullshit. I later found out after going to a psychiatrist that i did have anxiety and all of my head aches, sleepless nights, etc. were due to that. It’s best when you have one of these head aches to be in a dark room if you can. Try getting peppermint oil and rub that on your temples. Aleve personally works somewhat better for me. To help the physical symptoms, it really does help eating as healthy as you can and exercising. [info] None [info] 1560150647

toxicskiamachy [info] I am so sorry for all of your struggles.  I was diagnosed with anxiety at 15 and Fibro at 25 and I’m a 27F so I’ve been living with it for about two years.  I agree with you that you would understand how your anxiety manifests and trust me that you know your body and it’s NOT in your head.  Do not let anybody insult you in that manner by making assumptions like they know your body better than you do.My fibro started after I developed mononucleosis for the second time.  I was diagnosed within 6 months of onset which is a huge relief but now am getting neurological symptoms so I’m kind of on the same boat as you with ruling out an additional condition that pops up acutely about once a month.  I know what I felt like before fibro and it’s not in our heads.  I even lost weight and it has nothing to do with weight or being in/out of shape.  I have to really watch my activity level and get about 12 hours of sleep a night.  I mostly push through pain to be able to work and go back to school.  The crashes are becoming less frequent this way but they still happen and I’ve ended up in bed too.  I’ve been in bed where I literally have to have a cup of soup brought to me that I can drink and where I have to physically crawl to the restroom.  Fibro can be managed and just know you aren’t alone.  Feel free to DM me if you want to talk.  [info] None [info] 1528653212
Bad_Wulph [info] TL;DR I have the symptoms, I'm your age, and I've had an extensive cardiac workup. Every test came back well and I'm healthy. My symptoms are caused by a combination of scoliosis and anxiety. You're probably okay, but if you have any doubt, see a general practitioner.Hey man, I'm 22, male, 5'5", 120 lbs, white, with no known medical conditions. I have chest pains and dizziness very often. As I'm typing this, I feel discomfort in my chest and I'm a little dizzy. Take this with a grain of salt, as we may not be quite the same, but I was diagnosed with anxiety, and I've had an extensive cardiac workup. I've have bloodwork, xrays, multiple EKGs, two ultrasounds, a stress test, a 24 hour monitor, and a 30 day monitor. This has spanned across two different cardiologists, my family doctor, and a couple of ER visits. Everything came back perfect. They even went as far to say that my heart seems relatively fit, the complete opposite of unhealthy. The diagnosis I got was sinus tachycardia, which is not a problem with the heart itself, but my brain is telling my heart to speed up and act funny. They attributed that to me being a hypochondriac, which is indicative of anxiety. And they were right, I'm fine, but suffer from panic attacks frequently. If your cardiologists say your heart is healthy, they are probably right. Heart disease is usually decades in the making, and without a preexisting heart condition, it's almost impossible for you to have enough arterial plaque to cause a heart attack at your age, even if you did abuse your body as a teen. And as someone else said, if this has been going on a while and you aren't dead, it's probably not heart related.One reason for my chest pain is I have scoliosis (which was shown during one of my xrays), and it causes tension in my ribs, which pushes and pulls against the connective tissues holding my ribs to my sternum. That's why I have left-side chest pain, and it often causes me severe anxiety. Scoliosis and anxiety work in tandem to keep me worried about my health. I think you should see a general practitioner at this point, as they can likely determine if your pain is cardiac or musculoskeletal, and refer you to any needed specialists from there.

Seeeab [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety so whatever man. I put plenty of caveats and expanded in other posts to make clear I have no real advice. I also added caveats that there are many factors (including genetic and biologic).But fuck off lol. Anxiety can for sure be learned. If someone is raped as a child and it makes them anxious around certain dudes when they're an adult that's not a genetic issue. And sure enviornmental scenarios can trigger biologic changes too.

generalamitt [info] I think something may be wrong with my heart. I'm a 23 years old male, diagnosed with crohn's-colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.  I've been on Cimzia for about a year now which works great for my AS but does nothing for my colon inflammation.Roughly 10-7 days ago, I started feeling uncomfortable in my chest area. I am not sure how to describe it. It doesn't hurt, it feels almost like my heart is "missing beats" if that makes sense. I am restless and get the urge to move my legs. It is more noticeable during the evening hours. Yesterday I went for a run and had minor chest pain and nausea and had to stop short of my usual route.  I am feeling a bit nauseous right now actually,I never had any heart problems, and my family doesn't have any history of heart disease.  Could it be psychosomatic?  Side effect of Cimzia?   Getting tested right now would be a pain with how things are, should I wait a few more days or do you think I need to get checked today?&amp;#x200B;Edit: My ECG turned out normal. I was diagnosed with anxiety and was sent home. [info] None [info] 1585159413

dpefi [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and went through continuous treatment for two years, for that, before I finally found a therapist who asked about/saw my trauma. Being in therapy for anxiety was mildly helpful and gave me some helpful coping mechanisms, but it always felt like dealing with the surface-level of my problems. [info] None [info] 1543424507
pink_mango [info] Before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I used to go to the dr quite often for issues. Back aches, stomach aches, random pains. I would get stomach pains every single night before sleep. Aside from an actual back issue I had, everything else came back normal. And typically as soon as I went to get it checked out, I would feel better. This sure made me feel sane...Then I had an anxiety attack due to a very stressful job (quit shortly after), and went to my dr. He gave me this form to fill out to evaluate my anxiety, and looked at it after like "you've been dealing with this and didn't tell me?". Well I didn't know what it was, it just slowly got worse and worse over time and it felt normal to me. I went on medication, and within a few weeks I was feeling SO MUCH better, both mentally and physically. No more random pains, no more stomach pains, sleeping was so much easier.

runny6play [info] Depressed and in stress Hi all, I'm 24 years old who still lives with their parents and failing out of collage again for the second time. I have ADHD and I thought where my problems lie (with executive control) but I found out this year I was diagnosed with anxiety as a child, as well, and treatment was never pursued. I don't have terrible social anxiety, and in the past it wasn't a huge issue for me high school,except maybe English,was fairly easy for me was but as soon as I get below a B in a class in collage all my grades tank and I just avoid my problems, when I attempt to deal with them i end up internally freaking out and very frustrated so then I avoid them more. I want to be a successful software developer someday, I am very anxious and depressed about where I am now. As I'm typing this I should be studying for a math class that if I pull it together and study for I could get a C but because I'm scared of getting kicked out because I'm on probation and failed a class. I've started smoking on and off as it greatly downplays an attack. It really sucks to have an executive function disorder on top of anxiety as I always had a problem of scope mentally. Not being able to focus on the big picture is a problem when you have pessimistic anxiety. [info] None [info] 1524848958

2SP00KY4ME [info] Having constant gut-drop pangs like if you got a phone call and heard "There's been an accident".. physically painful, like getting stabbed. I hate it. Anyone else have this? I'm sorry if this has been asked before, I searched around a while but couldn't find anything that fit what I was talking about specifically.I get these pains / pangs randomly sometimes that are like the feeling when you find out something terrible happened. Like I said, picking up the phone and hearing a police officer say "There's been an accident", or when your girlfriend of years says "I'm leaving you". It's that sort of gut-drop horrible stabbing anxiety-pain, but it never has a good reason. I can just be surfing the internet or reading or whatever and it happens.For reference, I've been diagnosed with anxiety, and it's been steadily getting worse the past few months / year. Does anyone else deal with this? Thanks.Edit: Also, does anyone know a good way to reduce the severity or frequency of them? [info] None [info] 1452200223
SinLives [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder and agoraphobia but I gotta say I agree with you 100%. I can't take any anxiety medication like benzos cause I am on other meds they would interact with. So I don't have a fast acting pill I can pop to just make everything OK. There are plenty of breathing exercises and pre planning things you can do. If I'm nervous about something I have to NOT overthink it. That is the basis for a lot of people's problems. I just make up my mind if something has to be done then I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna let a diagnosis hold me back or make me prisoner in my own home. And as far as the lady pushing cop she should be charged with assault. There are laws in place for a reason. Do you excuse people for rape because their feelings made them do it? I'm sure people won't like my opinion but people with anxiety need to actively take steps to work thru it. Medications can help, therapy can help, but ultimately it comes down to that person working on it not hiding behind it. I understand it's different for everyone but it can't be used as an excuse for everything.  [info] None [info] 1547059068
Bluewall1 [info] First time smoking high CBD weed Hey Trees ! Little story :I have smoked weed like 20 times but it never felt right. I never felt really good after. I was more of a drinker.Few years later I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and it all made sense. Weed was making my anxiety worst. I had to take Xanax for a few months and went to therapy for like a year. I felt better but anxiety never leave. Always in my mind. all the time. For everything.So what have I been doing ? Not much, learnt to deal with it and maybe drink a bit more or more often than I should.Recently weed with low THC (less than 1%) and high CBD was made legal in Switzerland.I've bought some Colorado Indoor with a 15% CBD in it.And let me tell you, I've never felt this good during this evening. Well I actually did, when I was taking Xanax. So I guess I'm part of the family now ? If someone is in the same situation, please try it. I feel like my life will improve.Blaze it!

hdbaker009 [info] I seriously need help with my mental health. I feel my self declining with chronic worry and debilitating anxiety every other day. I can’t go on like this but I’m so broke and have awful health insurance. I was diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) a couple years ago. I was seeking counseling for it and benefited from it, when I had great insurance. Fast forward to now, husband got a new job and the insurance is shit. Utter shit. Not only that, but I called about three therapists in my area and none of them accepted my insurance. Each session is about $90 here and I simply cannot afford that. I would ask family for help, but we’ve already had to have help and am paying some family members back monthly, so I’m not doing that. I’m 26F but I worry chronically. It’s now become where I worry myself sick. Especially over health related issues, some that any normal person wouldn’t bat an eye at. I’m over sensitive to any “symptom” and not just in myself but my families, too. It’s not just occasionally that I worry, but about every other day. I’ll start to think about something, find one sign that it could be awful and I can’t for the love of Pete get my mind off of it. It’s affecting my mood, which effects my relationship with my family, and I’m afraid I’m going to lose control. I need help. I don’t know where to turn. I don’t like to burden friends with my problems and even if we was just talking about it lightly, that’s all I would ever talk about because there is always something weighing very heavy on my mind.

microwavedcatfood [info] My family insults me because of a mental illness. Okay, so some backstory. I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2012~2013 and I am absolutely terrified of getting sick. I stopped taking meds a while ago because I was doing better, but that’s not really the point. Anyways, so today my dad was baking some pizza from Papa Murphys. I was sitting at the kitchen table on my phone just messing around, and when it was ready, he poked it with his finger. Yes, that may have seemed insignificant, but to me he just spread millions of germs onto something I was about to eat.Because of that, I chose not to eat the pizza. I don’t want to get sick. I already refused eating it, and decided to just not eat anything so I just sat at the kitchen table still drinking my soda. My dad asked me several times if I wanted any, and of course I said no.What really made was what my uncle was saying. He was talking about how “I’m such a baby, it’s not that big of a deal, it’s all my fault...” and on and on. My dad was agreeing with him, and it sucked. I wasn’t choosing to eat it because I was being picky or stuck-up, but because I don’t want to get sick. I didn’t say anything though, because I knew I would just start crying. What was worse was that when I got up to get some more soda was that my six year old sister told me that I can’t drink it because ‘daddy touched it’, before running away giggling. Needless to say, I left shortly after.Similar things have been happening like that. The day before, I was eating a granola bar when my mom came and hugged me. Her sleeve touched my granola bar, so naturally I didn’t want to eat it. I offered it to her, and when she asked why, I explained. She then got angry at me because apparently I thought she was ‘dirty’, which wasn’t what I meant at all. She didn’t accept my apology.The day before, we had a pizza party for our choir. We could each get two slices, but when I tried to grab one with a napkin (I couldn’t watch my hands beforehand) it broke and I ended up touching it. I didn’t say anything and just tried to grab the second one, so I could only eat that one, but my finger slipped. My friend from behind me said, “What, MicrowavedCatFood, are you like a germaphobe or something?” When I put down my pizza saying I didn’t want it anymore. I don’t think she meant for it to be mean, but it just sucked. My eyes started selling up with tears and I went to leave the room when one of my friends stopped me and asked me what was wrong. I started crying and choked out, “I’m gonna get sick [friend], I’m gonna get sick.” She seemed confused so just hugged me and told me I’d be fine before leaving.I have more stories but I don’t want this to be so long. I’m so angry with my uncle and parents for acting like I’m faking it, or can control it or something. I don’t know how to explain that I can’t control it, and now it’s affecting me social life. Sorry for the rant, but I don’t have anyone to talk too.Tl:dr I am terrified of getting sick and my parents and siblings degrade me because of it, and it’s affecting my social life [info] None [info] 1557026534

veggie-berger [info] Struggling with symptoms, any advice? TW: medical anxiety&amp;#x200B;20/FHello! So, I have been suffering over the last three days with shortness of breath. I have been diagnosed with anxiety about 5 years ago but never followed up with much treatment(the therapist I saw was way too expensive for my family to afford, much less the psychiatrist who was going to prescribe meds). Now, I do not FEEL anxious right now.. besides worrying about why I am short of breath..but overall I do not feel anxious. Though, I have had a lot going on in my personal life as well as starting school again. I called the doctor and the nurse told me it sounds like anxiety.. but I do not feel anxious at all! So, I guess my question is: do I have to feel anxious to be having anxiety symptoms? If so, then any tips to help me cope with this before my appointment with my doctor on Monday?

amkmaker1754 [info] I Was an Anxious Child Hello, citizens of r/NoSleep, I am usually just a lurker here but tonight I wanted to share with you all, my own personal story. Edit: grammar.When I was six, I was diagnosed with anxiety and anorexia nervosa. I found that every time I tried to eat, or felt the slightest pang of hunger, I’d clam up. Refuse to put anything in my mouth. Why? Fear of choking on anything. I sometimes wouldn’t swallow my own saliva. When you’re six years old and suffering from something that seems so silly, so unbelievably childish, it begins to wear down your family. Puts strain on your parents, as they fight to keep you fed, let alone keep themselves sane. My mother and father would take me for walks. It started out casual. We’d dress my baby brother and go to McDonald’s. They’d order my favourite happy meal. Each time I’d cause such a fuss about taking a bite and choking on the nuggets that we’d always leave with the attention of every other customer in the restaurant. It got to the point where my mother couldn’t look at me without bursting into tears because I’d lost enough weight that you could so faintly see the dark shadows of my liver. Seems impossible, right? I’d show you all pictures as proof but we got rid of all the photos and memories of such a dark time so I could forget and move on. Looking back, it’s hard to recall why I’d developed such a fear. Why it crippled me and nearly drove my parents to insanity. Why all of a sudden policemen were showing up at my house out of the blue and questioning my mom and dad about why they were starving me. Surely my teachers at school had something to say. A six year old weighing under thirty five pounds wouldn’t necessarily go unnoticed. I didn’t know why I’d all of a sudden picked up this idea that I couldn’t eat or drink anything. Years passed by. I eventually broke through. After months and months of intense therapy with child shrinks, I defeated anorexia nervosa. Then they readjusted my diagnosis and told me I was plain old anxious. A constant over-thinker. My parents convinced them not to put me on medication. I could suppress it for some time. Eventually I found lots of coping mechanisms that helped when I started feeling the waves of panic flow through my body. At first I’d start going completely rigid on the living room carpet, eyes clenched, and my hands balled up into fists so strong my knuckles were white and my nails would pierce the soft skin of my palms. My nose would bleed. I’d be sent home from school because it would scare the other kids. Then gradually the attacks came on less strong. I would just excuse myself to go to the bathroom, practice my breathing as my shrink would tell me to do. Then after a while I’d find a way to think of other things. Distract my own conscience from itself. Not only was I grateful that there was finally some improvement, but my mom and dad could finally sleep at night. After my seventh birthday, the nightmares and night terrors started. That was a whole new level of torment. It was horrendous; I’d wake up soaking wet from sweating. I never wet the bed, however I did stress myself out so much that several times I vomited and wouldn’t stop until I passed out again. When my mom or dad, even my shrink, would ask me about them, I could never remember a single detail.But there was one thing that always stood out in the corner of my eye. I’d wake up some nights, unable to move, panicking after a particularly scary nightmare. I’d turn my head after struggling awhile to see the same little black thing hiding by the door. It had a sheep’s build—a thick, woolly body with knobbly legs. But it had no discernible face. I guessed at first that it was just so black that I couldn’t adjust my eyes enough before burying my head under the sheets as anyone would do. After all, aren’t sheets the one thing that would save you from the most malevolent of evils?At first I’d only wake up from a nightmare or night terrors once or twice a week. Then it started to get worse. As if it was bad enough that I didn’t eat for months at a time, I didn’t sleep. At all. It really reflected on my grades. To the point where, again, the police would question my parents about possible abuse or neglect. In school kids would avoid me. As if I had some terrible thing hanging over my shoulder. I didn’t understand it back then, but as I grew older, it began to dawn on me. See, this black thing…it would always get closer. I’d see it far clearer in my dreams than I could when I woke up. It was exactly as I previously described it…sheep-like. Jet black, with no face. Only in my dreams it had a face. Of a goat. And it would stand on two hooves rather than four like I originally assumed. It had little curly horns coming from its head. To top it all off, it would whisper things to me I wished I never heard. One day, out of the blue, I stopped having the nightmares. The terrors, waking up in the dead of night, pulling the covers over my head in hopes to drown out the repetitive whisper, “They can’t help you…they can’t help you…they don’t love you…they don’t love you…” Oh, god. I can still hear the voice, clear as day. My hands are shaking so bad right now, writing this. Excuse my rambling, but I’m bringing back years and years of torment and terror. I never expected for it to be this hard.I moved just after the nightmares stopped. I was in grade two. About seven or eight years old. After settling into my new home I stopped all the nightmare bullshit. It was a fucking miracle. I was eight when I finally got a good night’s rest without waking up. My parents, too, were more than pleased. My efforts in school blossomed. I was on cloud nine. And it stayed that way for a year or two. And one day, without having any sort of anxiety at all, it found me again. Only it had grown in size. And its features had become far more distinguished. I want to emphasize day, because that’s when I saw it. Broad fucking daylight, staring at me from down the hall in the doorway of my parents’ room. I darted into my room, slammed the door behind me, and held my dog. She whimpered and barked at the door, but there was no fucking way I was leaving my room. I should have mentioned that my brother and mom were across town at a soccer game. My dad was home but he was in the garage. He wouldn’t have heard my screams. When my mom got home she found me in my closet hiding under a bunch of clothes. At that point she finally started to understand that this wasn’t just some imaginary thing when my dog kept whining at the furnace grate in the hallway. It was nice to know that finally, after all the suffering I’d endured accompanied by the frustration of mom and dad never believing what I “thought I saw”, my mom knew. She wouldn’t tell my dad. He didn’t have an open mind about this stuff. We eventually deduced that it might have been linked to my anxiety. A physical manifestation of the panic inside my mind. Funny thing was that after a while my brother began seeing it too. Except he believed it was an imaginary friend. He’d play with it and I’d watch in horror as this fucking black thing that used to torture me while I slept would frolic around my brother’s room. Eventually I stopped fearing it. I started taking to my brother’s way of looking at it. Thought of it as a friend rather than a foe. Scared the shit out of my mom, honestly. I felt bad for her too, seeing as my dad couldn’t handle all the crazy and took a job overseas to escape it all. We moved again when I was in the middle of the seventh grade. By then I’d gotten my anxiety completely under control. I started to feel like a normal kid again, even though I missed the majority of my memorable childhood. We moved cross-country and I prayed to god that no matter how friendly it became, (we took to calling it “Teddy” and I guess it didn’t seem to mind) I wanted it to stay behind. I got my wish for almost eight years. My brother eventually grew too old to believe in imaginary friends. We both played lots of video games around that time. My parents started making lots more money so we could afford luxuries like that. My dad quit his job overseas, thankfully, so all in all my family had grown whole again, much less sane. In a way, I sort of missed all the attention. It was because of my childhood that I lived a very antisocial teenage-hood. I chose to pass on a lot of opportunities because I felt like I didn’t belong, like I was a freak in my own imaginary world. I mean, for all I knew, out of my whole life so far I was this weird girl who had meltdowns in class, and who would mutter to herself for hours about the things that “Teddy” whispered in my ear while I tried to sleep but couldn’t. I had no one I could relate to. Eventually I let this all go. I grew past all the anger, the built-up emotions. I graduated at the top of my class (since I had all that time to study rather than hanging with friends all the time like my brother did) and won a prestigious scholarship for a university I wanted so badly to attend. When the time came that I finally moved out and went to university, at first it was a bit of a shock. I’d be away from my mum. I didn’t know anyone. And for someone who, throughout their high school years struggled to make friends, I didn’t exactly have it easy. I soon met a boy (we’ll call him Jack) and fell head over heels for him. I started living my teenage years. School became less and less of an importance and more of a hobby. Unfortunately at the time, to my lack of knowledge, falling for this boy would have a disturbing outcome.“Teddy” found me. And boy, was he jealous. I thought at first that it might have been the dorm I was living in. The old building shifting and creaking with all the weight, since I was on the first floor. Then I heard the all-too-familiar whispering. Then the scratching at the door. The small scratches on Jack’s arms and back. They’d always be deeper and bloodier after we made love. Jack wasn't completely oblivious. Soon he became scared out of his mind. He stopped coming around the university, since he had his own apartment anyway. I spent all my time there instead. Stopped attending classes more and more. I’ll admit, it was all going downhill. A year goes by with little to no incidence. Jack and I decided it was time to move in together, as I quit university. I wasn’t prepared for the stresses of university. And I suppose the idea of living with a boy who’d look after me was more appealing anyways, so that’s what I did. I gave up my dream.So here I am, telling you this story. Sitting on my couch at home. Jack is away at work. I’ve no problems being home alone now. My apartment isn’t scary. Sometimes the odd shadow will catch my attention, but I could usually debunk it as my upstairs neighbours crossing the lawn. No worry at all, right? Well, I wish I could say I didn’t have to worry. Because I know he’s here. I know Teddy’s behind me. All I can hear is the whispers. "Jack is dead. Jack is dead. Jack is burning. Jack is burning." [info] None [info] 1426833006
meagicano [info] Yes - definitely! Time estimation is one of the big areas where I struggle, especially because I know what I can get done on a tight deadline. I'll reply to the OP first, then add some details.I also want to say that it's important that people realize they don't have to take on the battle of reducing the stigma of ADHD. It's a noble intention, but sometimes you have to look out for #1. This is something I've only learned through experience - I influence what I can directly, and I've had to let some things lie because I can't keep fighting. It takes up a lot of energy."Patience" isn't really an accommodation for work because there are often reasons why things need to be done on a certain timeline. Deadlines are often set for a reason - you could need to get something to a client, you could be part of a process and someone is depending on you to do your part so the next can go, you might need to have the response in time for payment processing, etc etc. It's hard to tell without knowing what the OP's job is, but an accommodation should be something that can help you get things out by an agreed upon deadline.If the deadline is completely arbitrary - that's hard from a mental perspective. I always try to figure out WHY a deadline has been set if I'm struggling with it. I don't ask my boss, but I look to the bigger picture. Like "ok, it has to be done by Tuesday noon so that X person can review it, then they can turn it around to me by the end of the day, so when I come in on Wednesday morning I can work on their comments..." An accommodation for "patience," based on how the OP described things, could be flex hours where the OP works for her agreed-upon eight hours a day, but with more flexibility. Instead of 8-5, she could work 8:15-5:15pm or something similar, depending on when she gets in each morning. I used to work for a company that had a "core hours" policy of 9:30-3, but outside of that you could work however you wanted.If the five minutes thing is for meetings, etc., OP should take a look at that. Why are they late? Are there Outlook reminders? I have Outlook reminders at 15 minutes, then I snooze until 5 minutes before, and then I snooze that until the meeting itself starts, which is when I join. I make those alerts pop up right in front of me. Anytime I leave my desk, I check my calendar. I live and die by my Outlook calendar and usually I've been really lucky. I'll set other reminders and timers as necessary.Taking on new projects - are you putting your hand up to volunteer? Is this at work or in your outside life? An accommodation associated with this would be that you're not overscheduled. You could ask to put any new projects on hold for the time being. Part of the challenge in this is the ADHDer's quest for novelty... doing the same thing over and over again, or being stuck on a project for a long time can be the worst. Depending on the work you do, you could ask to just be support on projects, so that you're not doing it from start to finish, or seek one project (instead of three) that lets you challenge yourself so that you're constantly learning from that instead of jumping from thing to thing.As for me....I was diagnosed at 33, in 2017. My aunt suspected I had ADHD when I was in my early 20s, since her kids had been diagnosed, but there wasn't a lot of information out there about women and ADHD and I just always kept it tucked in the back of my head. Babysitters would call me "hyper" and teachers always told me to be more ladylike, since the boys would be able to run in the mud, etc. and apparently it was the wrong way for girls to burn off energy. I never paid attention in class... I had years upon years of teachers complaining to my parents that I was reading books under the desk. I never really put a lot of time into homework, and while there are some massive gaps in my education, I was smart enough at the time to slide by without having to put in the work. I struggled with Calculus in high school, but dropped the class with 30+ people and took it in summer school instead with five others and got an A.The fact I got good marks was enough. I struggled in my jobs, especially when things became repetitive and boring, but never put 2 and 2 together. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was leaving the military, and the psychologist said that all of my past experience was likely due to anxiety, but a social worker I saw said she didn't think that was a fair assessment. I did fine in my MBA program, and at work, until things started to get overwhelming. During my MBA I had randomly read about women and ADHD, and how the symptoms are different for women than men. I went into a research rabbit hole and tried to get diagnosed, but my only option was paying out of pocket or spending years on a waitlist. I pushed it aside until things at work were really challenging for me. It all came to a head after something happened at work and I was thrown off my groove, and I just couldn't focus or get anything done that I wanted to do. I was in a different financial position with difference insurance, so I did a multiday assessment that ended with the psychiatrist being like "yeah... you definitely have ADHD and you've gotten where you are because you're smart".SO. Long backstory, but the overview is important (I think).Time estimation is HARD and it's something that I really struggle with. I have a VP I work with who makes promises to clients and I've started having to disagree with him in front of the clients to come up with a reasonable timeline.If I've done the work before, or something very similar, the time estimates are a bit easier. I always add in ADHD time - a buffer in case I can't focus, or in case something else comes up - that gives me a bit of breathing room. We've also updated our branding guidelines, so I've been adding in a buffer to account for updating to the current standards. If I don't have time, I'll send very plain content out so that I can get feedback on the "meat" of what's been presented. The challenge is that sometimes I don't know just how much work will go into something. I developed a two hour workshop for a client over the weekend - I had thought I'd be able to get it done in a few hours, but I didn't realize how much research and tweaking I would have to do. I ended up cancelling a ski day to get it done. I should have started working on it first thing in the morning on the Saturday instead of around lunchtime... but even that might not have been enough time. The partner saw it and thought I put in about 30-36 hours of work - which is definitely more than I did - but it shows how experience can help with time estimation.When I come up with a workplan, I try to break things down into details so I can better estimate my time. I don't always share this with leadership because I don't want to be held to it. But it lets me plan my time and I'll know that if I have an hour or two I can knock off something with a shorter time frame than deciding to tackle a bigger piece.I also struggle with things like, taking a shower and getting ready and knowing how much time it takes. Or how long it takes to get to work (our office location changed and it has doubled my commute - and made it so much harder for me). I have the timing estimates down perfectly on some things, like my commute to the airport, but the day to day stuff is a lot harder. I add buffers to almost everything. I also set alarms at weird times to everything. Like, 8:28am instead of 8:30, since it makes me think a bit when the alarm goes off in the morning. If I think something will take me two hours to turn around, I tell whoever is waiting I'll have to them in three. I've been trying to overestimate, especially if it's a deadline negotiation, because it's better for me to under-promise.OH and I use trello all the time (for me). I have colour coding for current projects, upcoming, personal things to do, other work things to do, etc. and I use that to set priorities. Traditional to-do lists don't work for me.Did that help?

sunnys1deups1dedown [info] If a woman smiles repeatedly, looks at you with interest, or strikes up a conversation, then you probably aren’t going to bother her but please don’t do a cold approach. I live in a big city and walk most places, so I end up being approached by men fairly often. I’ve been physically cornered, creepily leered at, and followed (among other unsettling experiences), so now I don’t want to talk to anyone on the street — like, ever. When someone approaches, my first instinct is “God, please no, leave me alone,” followed by “please ignore me, please ignore me, please ignore me.” Yes, I have been diagnosed with anxiety so maybe my reactions are more negative than others would have, but I don’t see why it’s necessary to insert yourself into someone else’s day just because you find them physically attractive. I always feel gross and objectified (and sometimes scared) when this happens, and I’ve never once enjoyed the experience or handed over my number. TL;DR: Only approach women who seem interested in you or who make contact first. Otherwise, just go about your day. [info] None [info] 1563770446
kmw920 [info] There are several causes, including my family. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in last May. Looking back I actually had a panic attack (couldn't breathe well) on the plane in June in 2017. I think these two years or so have intensified my anxiety. When more and more physical discomfort got accumulated in my body, I couldn't bear it anymore. Last May one night I had breathing difficulty (this problem emerged significantly in last April). I couldn't stand up. My limbs got so numb and cold and purple. Heart rate was fast. My family called the emergency line and I was sent to a hospital. I get worried and nervous easily since I was a kid. Also since primary school, I've been underweight. My BMI now is around 14.6.  [info] None [info] 1549642306

TheKatsMeow0_0 [info] Severe anxiety attack...,, Monday I was riding Bart and had anxiety attack. I couldn’t walk and requested emt. I ended up walking the stairs because the elevator wasn’t working. I feel so stupid in doing so as some don’t see it as a condition. It just happened out of nowhere and I fainted against the bike rack and got transported to kasier. I have taken a week off work to get my medication adjusted or prescribed a new one. I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2016 and ptsd in 2017. Things stemming from my past that I never dealt with came out. Im on 30mg of Celexa I went up a dose in Oct. I’m not sure what else I should be doing. I have enrolled in anxiety classes and have started working out. As well as meditating.....I’m dealing with my past issues it’s like what needs to be done so I can be myself and medication free.  Is it always going to be like this? I accepted my disorders.....I hate feeling this way. [info] None [info] 1552549698
megawalelord [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety as a kid, but through a lot of practice I have it pretty much 100% under control. I would say I am genuinely happy and content with my life around 80% of the time which I think is really good. It's all about balance. I pick an area of my life that I would like to work on and focus on that. This year I am focusing on extracurricular involvement and actually joining things that interest me or I am passionate about. I'm also really careful of not falling into the trap that I need to be constantly working on myself from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep every day. You need time to do the things that make you happy, because those things are making you a more whole person too. It's pretty much about finding things that make you happy and balance them with things that help you grow as a person. [info] Female [info] 1474049329
SpatialJoinz [info] Checking my 2 day old's breathing constantly Hi Daddit, we had our little bundle of joy day before yesterday and it was a pretty smooth delivery. First child.  I was hoping to get some words of advice on anxiety.  I just spent 9 months worrying about the pregnancy and labor, now that it's over I've moved on to worrying about  him directly.  He was just on my tummy for awhile hanging out sleeping after feeding, all swaddled up and his breathing became so light I thought it stopped. Called my wife in, properly freaked her out, lifted him up and he was so sleepy he was limp at first, scared the ever living shit out of us.  He's fine, he is absolutely fine, but that freaked me out bad.Any advice?  Has anyone else experienced this.  I should also mention I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder but on a very good treatment plan and typically don't worry to this detail anymore.  I'm sure this breathing anxiety is common.  Thanks Daddit and I look forward to being part of the community! [info]  [info] 1485155877

lilwoodzey2013 [info] IWTL how to stop grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw when I sleep!! I have been diagnosed with anxiety, so I know that’s probably the main issue. It’s causing me to grind my teeth down and even a bit of receding gum lines. I have a mouth guard I wear at night, but does anyone else have experience with this and have any tips?Thank you :) [info] None [info] 1511356894
Mollinator5 [info] I’ve been typed mostly INTJ, ISTJ and INTP.How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.I am 17 years old and female. I am quiet and never talk to strangers unless online or they happen to have the same interests as me somehow or know of an assignment I missed. When I am with my friends, I am extremely obnoxious, loud, sometimes rude (like swearing and calling them ‘dumbass,’ but I don’t actually think they are...usually).Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I possibly have excoriation disorder (literally go to a therapist for it).Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?I was raised barely Catholic (we only prayed on holidays). I responded by saying how Jesus can’t be born. Because the Holy Spirit doesn’t have semen and therefore can’t procreate with Mary. I am one for modernism in the Scoped Trials.What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I am unemployed as a high schooler. If I were to do a career, it would be something medical without massive blood (opposite of trauma surgery).If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?I would be kind of both. Like I would want to be refreshed in the morning and afternoon, but then during the evening I would like to chat a little. If I were given a single player game, I would not care if I was alone for a weekend if it meant I could play the game.What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?I love video games (First Person Shooters, RPG, and strategy). I also draw and study anatomy or history for fun. I am not good at sports but made 2nd for my table tennis championship. It was teams, so I was carried. I hate the outdoors since I am allergic to bug bites and they will bite me anywhere...I mean anywhere. Probably TMI.How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?I am very curious about the future and kind of pessimistic. I honestly think the future will be like Wall-E where it is a trash planet in less than 10,000 years. Literally. But I like to think for fun about futuristic cars, technology and how it could work. And I have no clue if it is environmental or conceptual. I think conceptual? I don’t daydream much but when I do, if it isn’t about my science fiction character, it’s about how the world will end and hypothetical scenarios like zombies, epidemic, etc..Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?Nope, nope, and nope. I would be meh. I would expect everyone to do the task I assigned them and if they don’t, well, I will be pissed as fuck. I will show it like Gordon Ramsey bashing dishes LOL. If it is acquaintances, probably would keep it to myself but be passive aggressive and ask them if they could do this part of what I assigned.Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?I have no clue what that question is asking. And I do, love clay and pottery. It’s satisfying, soothes my skin (sensitive skin, red and itchy when many materials touch it) and is fun to do.Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.I do draw time from time of humans. I still haven’t decided on a style. I like Marvel Comics art style though! Kind of cartoony but mainly realistic lineart.What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I groan whenever I see political stuff like racism or sexism. It is bad but if I see it, I will just be angry, so I avoid it whenever I can, one reason I hate the past (yet like history class) and despise the present in terms of news. Although that black hole photo made me extremely excited for once! So cool. And the future I think will be crap, but at least I will be dead by the time it explodes, sun eats it, nuclear explosion occurs, etcHow do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?I will help them. I secretly want a reward but also want to look nice. Usually I don’t get a reward and I won’t be bothered.Do you need logical consistency in your life?Yes. No evidence, I won’t believe it. Also I hate saying 100% because most of the time that is literally impossible. It could be 99.9%. That’s why the personality tests make me a bit mad. They say definitely agree. Does that mean like 99.9% agree? I think nothing is definite, so I rarely answer the far left or right.How important is efficiency and productivity to you?Keep work consistent and I am fine. Efficiency is how everything is produced and cycled smoothly.Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?I don’t. I may criticize them for doing something, but not control.What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?Video games because I go at my pace and I get power and control. And I can do things that you can’t in real life like parkour, kill people with a motorcycle, hack appliances, etc..What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?I am both audio and visual. I struggle with stupidity. By that, I mean people who CONSTANTLY talk during class. They make me want to rip my hair out. And I do literally sometimes (I know it’s bad). Also people who lack common sense. I also hate pushover teachers. I prefer classes that aren’t math. My favorite class would probably be biology. I am taking Anatomy soon and bet that will be number one. It is memorization, but partially logic in knowing how human parts connect. I hate numbers.How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?I am okay. And yes, I think I can easily do that. I sometimes wing projects, but it is less compared to me planning ahead.What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?I want to have a job I like that pays okay, find a best friend who shares every single thing I would want, and I guess other clichés like romance.What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?Those CGI bacteria animations scare the shit out of me. Spiders, lobsters, crabs, deep marine creatures like that toothless looking shark with a huge mouth and tardigrades scare me to hell. I hate clowns and also when someone is framed in a show and everyone doesn’t believe them.What do the "highs" in your life look like?Seeing huge discoveries on the news that are science related, being praised, winning a game, being with my dog and watching YouTube videos about video game companies being greedy or lazy.What do the "lows" in your life look like?Meltdowns, getting a B or lower on any assignment or test, my excessive skin and hair picking (literally my scalp hurts a lot because there are two large torn off scabs on my scalp), and my 17 surgeries were lows.How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?I am pretty attached. I obsess over staring at live action actors or actresses to see how awkward them acting is and I am usually not engaged emotionally in shows or movies. The few that made me actually cry were Violet Evergarden (anime drama about love), A Silent Voice (some anime of a dead girl), and that one Shiba Inu or something that stayed at a station waiting for his master then at the end he dies, finally leaving the station. I daydream a quarter of the time. And I am aware usually.Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?I am alone. Well, it depends. Why am I there? Captured? I would yell and then get tired and look for a way out. If for fun, I would think about our ending of humanity, video game news, my fictional character and then go to sleep to be let out of the room (time going quicker).How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?It takes forever if important. If like a food order, I’ll be a little shy but mainly because of my appearance. And I change my mind half of the time then back and fourth.How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?Not long. If I am pissed, I am pissed. If I am sad, I will know. If I am elated, I will be just bouncing around literally yelling out loud.Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?Nope. Fuck that. If you are stupid to me, lack common sense, just have an opinion about a flavor of ice cream or politics, I will disagree. Sometimes I even disagree even though I agree inside just so I can socialize for once (since not many do to me at school).Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?I don’t besides skipping mass at my school LMAO. And nah, they should know better. I don’t really mind them since they haven’t been a part of my life much.Ask me anything else you need to help type me. [info] None [info] 1555726235
MannyOmega [info] Got diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago. For me, it's more like my ego and pride can be very big. Thus, I tend to project a reckless bravado, so that I won't be hurt due to rejection or feel that I'm a burden on others. This bravado, a result of my ego, makes me a bit of a dickhead, even though I'm well liked. I'm trying to change who I am, but it's very hard. It's like a defense mechanism for me. Without it, I feel vulnerable. With it, most people I know carry an affection for me. Habits that are constantly positively reinforced are hard to break. I might be different than others in that I know how to socialize, and am quite good at it. I have my moments of awkwardness, but for the most part I am socially competent. My father, due to the nature of his job, put me into a lot of social situations that I dreaded when I was younger. Thanks to it, though, I've developed many social skills. My social anxiety manifests in that it makes me nervous to be around my closer friends. Small talk with strangers or an idle chat with an acquaintance is no problem. but I struggle to consistently interact with close friends because I feel that at any moment I could make a mistake that ruins the friendship. I'm afraid that they wouldn't really like my true self (if I even have one anymore, the bravado has blurred the lines) so I often pull away in fear. I was diagnosed with anxiety in general though, not specifically social anxiety. I have no idea if you can even be diagnosed with specifically social anxiety, and in my case I was simply told to continue meeting with my therapist for my anxiety. I simply know that social anxiety is a big part of the anxiety I can feel. Thus, all that I have written has not been scientifically tested, but rather the findings I've seen based on the result of my own introspection.Take what I say with a grain of salt, as my experiences do not reflect all who have anxiety.

alexthegeologist [info] Help? Anxiety vs Dysautonomia I just got out of seeing a cardiologist who told me all or most of my symptoms are anxiety related. I've been diagnosed with anxiety for years, but I am realizing that some of the symptoms I attributed to my anxiety might not have been anxiety. Like when I feel chest pains and heart beating too quickly but I'm not anxious about anything mentally. There have definitely been times when I was anxious mentally and physically or just mentally. I was also recently diagnosed with EDS. The cardiologist said she thinks it's all adrenaline/anxiety. But she completely disregarded all the other symptoms I've been having, like temperature disregulation, frequent near syncope, exhaustion, GI problems, sleep problems, tremors, dizziness, Raynaud's.  I just don't know where to go with this, because my heart rate is too low for any sort of beta blocker and her only recommendation was anti anxiety medication, which I've been on for years (various ones). I can't take my ADHD medication because it feels like my heart beats too quickly. And I can't be medicated with Xanax all the time because I'd become a bezo dependent zombie. I just don't know what to do now. When I brought up how I was still having problems despite her saying it was just anxiety, she said it wasn't her area (aka psychiatry). [info] None [info] 1571151199

I can't tell you how many people I've met who define themselves by their anxiety and act like I wouldn't understand... But I've been diagnosed with anxiety too...

soapyspooks [info] How would you want to be approached about this issue? This might sound silly, but I've been diagnosed with anxiety and autism, so I tend to have trouble communicating (especially with authority figures), hence why I'm asking here . I'm in tenth grade and we're doing a pottery unit in my art class. I'm absolutely horrible with it and have no prior experience (Note that we had zero lessons teaching us the basics, we were just told to make something fitting into a theme). I love my teacher, I think she's really skilled but she constantly lectures me and calls me out in front of my class for not doing it right. Now, I get it but I just want her to show me what I actually have to do? I'm not doing the wrong thing because I'm lazy, and I sit alone in class off my phone. I'm genuinely trying so hard but every time I ask her for help I just get told to hurry up (it doesn't help that I'm pathetically sensitive, and tear up after almost every time she talks to me). If you were a teacher who thought they weren't doing anything wrong, what'd be the most respectful way I could approach you about this? [info] None [info] 1580216613
NitretGaming [info] This doesn't help for everyone but I just simply smile and I taught myself not to care about the simple things. If I lost 50 bucks I would be so stressed 2 years ago but I've learned money isn't everything and that I care more about being happy than worrying about money. I know that stressing WILL NOT HELP AT ALL.  For anxiety I just smile and think positive. Whenever I'm in a large group I try to just smile it out and "act cool." This somehow brings my anxiety down + I've listed to common phrases that "good speakers" have used and used them myself in a conversation to act like I know what I'm doing even though I don't and I'm really nervous.  If it's social anxiety we're talking about this one helps A LOT. Learn to not be embarrassed. Even if you did the stupidest thing just laugh it off. (It's no big deal when you look at the bigger picture.) For example singing the wrong lyric to a song out loud and then on top of that, being called out for it. I just say "oh shit what is it then" and laugh it off. Even if I'm internally crying. (BTW if you have any friends that shit on you for getting a song lyric wrong don't be friends w/ them please)  Just try your best to learn to overcome it, kinda like a fear. Just smile and remember in the end, fuck it, just be happy.  (Note: I've been diagnosed with anxiety and social anxiety)  GOOD LUCK I BELIEVE IN YOU :D [info] None [info] 1551669465

MoosesMom7 [info] I had no idea that it wasn't just me. I've been a lurker for a while now, and I didn't realize just how many people had similar stories to my own. I could probably write a book about the crap I had to deal with growing up. I think it's important to share stories, and see commonalities, so here's mine. &amp;#x200B;My Mother is a narcissist. As a little girl, I was her baby doll, being dressed up in the cutest dresses and being constantly doted on. Once I started talking, that's when everything went down hill. I would be yelled at, hit, called every name in the book, and was basically her slave. If she wasn't giving me a verbal beatdown, she was ordering me around, "take out the trash", "make me food", &amp; and so many others. She went so far as to encourage me to commit suicide, and had I actually been suicidal at the time, I can't say that I wouldn't have followed through with it. There were a few times in high school when she didn't allow me to shower because it would, "raise the light bill".  My aunts and uncle, were always her sisters and brother, she never spoke of them in relation to me. No matter what happened, it was never her fault. She got arrested once, and it was the cop's fault. My dad was a bastard, in her mind, when he gave me stuff and not her. &amp;#x200B;When I was 14, I was hit by a car and taken to the hospital with a dislocated knee. Rather than ask me if I was alright, she got into the room, waited until the doctors and nurses were gone, and told me I was going to get so much money from this. Yep, you read that right. I was just hit by a car, and she was looking forward to the settlement money that I would eventually get. I did get a pretty decent settlement from the accident though, about $9500. Thankfully, my dad was smart and got me a lawyer, and I set up a meeting with her to ask her to hold on to the check until I turned 18. I picked up the check shortly after my 18th birthday, and opened a savings account in my name. Boy was she pissed that she wasn't on the account, she needed the money "to raise me". She conned me out of $4000 dollars, which she used to pay off her credit cards, and told me she would pay back... that was over five years ago and I still haven't seen a penny. &amp;#x200B;Sometimes, I'd lose things, like any normal person would. When I'd ask her if she'd seen it, she would say that I was accusing her of stealing it. One time, she swiped a five dollar bill out of my pants and I asked her if she had seen it, as I thought I may have left it on a counter or something, again, I was the bitch for accusing her of stealing. Yet, after I took the dog out to cool off, she called me into my room, lifted a pillow, and lo and behold, there was my money. All nice and flat underneath the pillow. It's kind of hard to believe that she didn't put it there, considering it was crumpled up in my pocket the day before. &amp;#x200B;About a month before I graduated high school, she kicked me out for going to the bathroom before getting ready for school, because it "went against routine". I was a "backwards ass", which angered me and things escalated to the point where she said, "your 18, you're on your own, get the fuck out of my house". I was so upset that when my dad picked me up, I was sitting on the front porch crying. I called off from school that day, I was 18, so I could excuse myself. She got a call saying that I wasn't in class, and reported me skipping. This would have barred me from walking at graduation, and I told her as much. So she got to call the attendance office and excuse the absence so I could walk. Thankfully, she was willing to let me spend the weekend at my father's house, like she did unless she was pissed at him for some stupid reason, and I stuffed my duffel bag as full as I could get it and didn't come home after the weekend. The following Monday, I went to the school counselor and changed my address to my dad's and explained what happened. She was beyond kind and understanding and told me exactly what I had to do. &amp;#x200B;Of course, there were complications, she wouldn't let me have my things or my dog. For about two years, I had to steal from myself just so I could have clothes. She let her crackhead friends sleep in my room, do drugs in there (I once found a makeshift pipe) and take whatever clothes and jewelry they wanted. I was furious when I found my class ring missing, and she got pissed when I confronted her and told her I had reported it stolen, and given the police her friend's names and contact info. &amp;#x200B;It took nearly two years for me to get my dog back, and when I did he was skin and bones, with wounds from a fight with another dog. It took me three days to get him to eat, and he was just barely beginning to gain weight when my mother brought the cops to my house after I refused to give him back to her. She wanted to take him back to the same house, where the dog that attacked him lived, and out of concern for his safety, I said no. Unfortunately, because everything pertaining to him was in her name, I was forced to give him back to her. I told her to never speak to me again. She called me the same damn day and told me to come get him because he'd been hurt again. I was livid. My dad and I were sharing a car at the time, so I didn't have the car until the following monday, and when I went to get him, I was infuriated. She had left him in his kennel the entire weekend, not even letting him out to go to the bathroom. His kennel was soaked in urine, and he was bonier than before, as if he hadn't eaten. I took him home, gave him a bath, fed him, washed out his kennel, set up an appointment with a vet I knew, and got him registered in our county. My baby ate like he was starved. He cleaned the bowl in less than 10 minutes. I would be damned if she took him from me again, as she clearly demonstrated that she wasn't capable of taking care of him. She tried again about six months later, and failed. My Moose has been living with me for about three years now, although he's still got some trust issues surrounding women, he knows that I'll do anything to make sure he has what he needs. He doesn't get hit, he doesn't get yelled at (unless he's doing the yelling), and he doesn't get locked in the kennel unless we have to leave for more than a couple hours (he gets bored and destroys the apartment).&amp;#x200B;My mother has more recently convinced my family that I'm nothing but a liar and a thief. None of my maternal family members speak to me, especially after I cut my mother out of my life a couple years ago. I only have one cousin who talks to me because he's lived with her. He knows what she's like, and he saw the way she treated me. He's the only one who believed me. &amp;#x200B;One of her favorite abuse techniques is telephone harassment. She used to call me upwards of 40 times a day, calling me every name in the book, detailing how she was going to get me fired, making threats on my life, things like that. Eventually, she got my work phone number, and started harassing me at work. So, my boss got involved, and called a couple friends of his at the local police department (he had retired from there several years earlier). I spoke to an officer, and explained what was happening, let her listen to the voicemails that she left. And she said that she would tell her to cut it out, but, if she did that, I couldn't reach out to her. This was because, if I wanted to press telephone harassment charges, the DA wouldn't take the case if I'd reached out and contacted her. I agreed not to contact her. Little did I know, I had just made the best decision of my life. &amp;#x200B;About a year after she threw me out, I was diagnosed with anxiety, likely caused by the abuse from my mother. It took over a year of therapy, and daily SSRI's, but I'm doing really well. Cutting her out of my life was one of the best things I ever did, and I don't regret it in the slightest. I have a wonderful Fiance, a nice apartment, Moose is spoiled rotten, and things are looking great for me. It's possible to overcome the lifetimes of abuse we all suffer. It's not easy, but it's doable. No contact has been a great thing for me, and I have no reason or desire to make contact with her. And I'm determined to not raise my children the way she raised me. I refuse to be that kind of mother. Our family's cycle of abuse stops with me. [info] None [info] 1536052407
intergalaxy9 [info] my immediate supervisor thinks i stole something of hers. its causing me so much emotional distress. i’m in a tight spot at work because my immediate supervisor (NOT my boss) had her vape stolen last week. and i’ve been feeling her disposition towards me change which makes me feel like she thinks i did since i vape as well. but i pushed those thoughts aside thinking that she might just be tired or busy that week.however, today i was summoned by the admin representative of my department and questioned about the lost vape. i felt it was an insult but i was polite and i answered their questions truthfully.but now i am sad cause now i know that my coworker REALLY thinks i did it. and now i’m pretty sure the admin believes her since they questioned me.its really upsetting because its just my 3rd week on the job and i’m 23 and this is my first job. and she’s 50 and doing what i feel are very childish things like ignoring my “good morning”s and such.i am sad that our relationship turned out like this because i really respect her. now she doesnt even meet my eyes. and its awkward because her work bay is right next to mine. i cant work properly. i am diagnosed with anxiety and the creeping feeling that people hate you or are talking about you behind your back is the worst thing to me.i want to tell my boss what i’m feeling but will i seem like a tattle tale? i dont want to tattle. i just want someone to talk to. its my first ever job and i’m such an outlander here. i just want this to be cleared up and over with so that i can work comfortably again. and also for the sake of my integrity, especially in the eyes of any future employers i might have.TL;DR: I’m pretty sure my immediate supervisor hates me because she thinks I stole her vape. I was summoned by the admin and questioned about the stolen vape. I feel insulted and i am very upset because its only my 3rd week at my first job ever. What should i do?

ikerevobsession [info] I have a weird bump on my eyelid and I'm not sure what it is First of all:Age: 19Sex: technically female but I identify as male Race: White (British)Height: around 160cm (5'3-ish) Weight: I haven't checked it in a long timeExisting medical issues: none, but I was diagnosed with anxiety recently Medication: Propranolol (40mg, for said anxiety) Drug use: noneSmoking status: never have smoked never will smokeSo, this bump on my eyelid. I was doing a test in my French class yesterday (29th November) when suddenly, my left eye started to hurt when I blinked. I kept it closed for the remainder of the test so I could concentrate on it. Before, it was just painful on the outer corner of my eyelid and it wasn't swollen. My test started at 12pm, by about 7pm, there was a small, pimple-like bump on the area that was painful, so I thought it was just acne on my eyelid which I didn't rule out bc I have really oily eyelids despite the skin on my face being dryer than the Sahara Desert. Anyway, fastforward to this morning and it's way more swollen that it was the night before. It was literally like I got filler in that one area of my eyelid. It's now almost 4pm and it's less swollen but it still hurts to blink. It doesn't look like a stye or anything similar so I'm very confused as to what it is. Anyone have any ideas? And how would I treat it? Should I just let it do its thing? Pictures can be provided if needed. [info] User Not Verified [info] 1575129816

Amykazaam [info] Hey! I’m also a third semester BSN student. I highly recommend therapy if you are noticing exacerbations regarding your trichotillomania.Not only can therapy assist with preventing bald spots, it can help address the cause— stress. Stress is interesting because (as you might already know) it can be broken down in two general subdivisions— distress and eustress. It sounds to me that’s you’re currently enduring distress.This is important because sustained levels of stress have been correlated with an overall decrease in your ability to actively and efficiently learn and retain information the first time you are exposed to it. In turn, you end up needing to spend more time to studying, partially due to the reduction in active classroom learning. So seek out therapy, yes it will take time, and yes I understand how little time you have. However, it can actually end up saving you time in the long run! It can also help foster better nurse-patient relationships and decrease the likeliness of you experiencing nurse burnout! Also, what works for me (I am diagnosed with anxiety) the app Headspace. It has free little mindfulness therapy exercises and you can choose how much (or how little) time you want to put aside for mindfulness, which can be as short as 5 minutes. There’s such a need at my school, they provide free therapy for nursing students. You are not alone with this and there’s nothing wrong with seeking help.I’m really glad that you do already practice self-care. That’s huge, a lot of people don’t engage in proper self-care, and I’m really proud of you for doing so. Here are some links you might find interesting: https://www.headspace.com/blog/2017/05/31/a-day-with-trichotillomania/(Headspace article about mindfulness and trichotillomania— it’s totally subjective, but I thought you might be able to relate to it)https://www.americannursetoday.com/mindful-nurse/(Article from the ANA about mindfulness and nursing) https://www.nature.com/articles/npjscilearn201611(Research article that demonstrates the impact of stress on learning and memory, centered around educational and academic environment and exposure) http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-kinds.aspx(American Psychological Association article regarding different types of stress, it might be a good read if you aren’t already familiar with the different categories of stress!)

I never used to study and now I have to and I’m struggling. I’m in the process of being diagnosed at the moment because I’ve never needed help until now and I just assumed I was lazy and stupid. I was diagnosed with anxiety in high school and my psychiatrist told me that I could have ADHD without me ever even mentioning it and at first I was like nah because I hadn’t ever considered it, but it definitely made me think and now I’m fairly confident I do.

ScreamYouFreak [info] No and no.The doctors will advise against taking any medication or eating anything before the surgery because it could cause issues during the surgery. You don’t want to choke on your own vomit because you got hungry before surgery. You don’t want to have a heart attack during the surgery because you had anxiety and decided to pop pills beforehand (I am diagnosed with anxiety too, so I know where you’re coming from). The doctors and nurses should make everything just fine for you, but make sure to listen to them.Furthermore, you can ride your bike to them, but won’t be able to drive it back. After going under anesthesia, they’re legally required to wheel you or borderline carry you to a vehicle that you will not and cannot operate. This is due to liability reasons and they will check that everything is in place beforehand.Get an uber/lift or a friend to take you. Don’t be dumb.  [info] None [info] 1540216467

ihateapplepie [info] I have never felt important to my parents. I've sadly come to the conclusions recently that my dad who I thought used to be on my side is an enabler and kinda bad himselfMy dad and I used to sit and cry in the car with how NMom treated us. We would vent to eachother, we would talk things out. He would listen to me scream my frustrations and I would do the same for him. Then one day I was venting and he just says "I think you should stop saying these things about your mother." And I felt i had the air sucked out of my lungsI feel like my parents never took me seriously or cared about me. I've literally never, not once, been to a dentist and I thought that was normal. I broke my ankle once and they took me to the doctor and then hid it from me, acted like everything was fine. I control my doctor stuff now and saw the after visit summary from all those years ago indicating a break. My ankle has serious damage from not getting that break taken care of. I was diagnosed with anxiety and adhd in middle school. They literally refused to take me to any doctors. My mom is a fucking nurse. They both had a lot of meds. All of my brothers had meds. Just not me. I begged them because I had nightly panic attacks. My dad always said "okay I'll do it" and then when it came to me they would never schedule. When I was finally brought in and given a medication, he never took me to the follow up and my meds ran out. Then he wouldn't take me because next time we went he would have to pay a fee for missing it with no notice or something. My brothers were fully medicated and regulated. Due to my adhd and other problems I seriously struggled in school. My parents never cared and just blamed me for being lazy. My teacher sat me down and was like you are struggling why are you not in an IEP or something. I told him it was because my parents wouldnt allow it. He was shocked. (Considering my brother was in 3 IEP classes) They had the IEP teacher secretly take me to her math class and he would just give me the grades for how I did on that work instead. He was a fantastic teacher.I don't really know where this is going. I guess its a vent? [info] None [info] 1540126478
threeyearwarranty [info] People always talk about doing something you fear so that you can conquer it so why is this being viewed as a bad thing? Dyeing your hair is a concious choice.. and for some, it's a choice to be more confident.. or at least the chance to pretend to be...Also, sometimes people just want to change their appearance for *themselves* and they dont necessarily take the time to think/care about the effect it will have on how others would view them.PS. I've been diagnosed with anxiety but I actually do want to dye my hair somehing bright. (Am a straight guy) I just havent been able to yet. I've spent a lot of time thinking about the attention it will draw (which terrifies me, like you said) and honestly I still want it bcs I still think it's hella cute.

DannyDerulo [info] Diagnosed with ADD on Saturday,... what now? Title says it. 20f, junior in college, was having a phone call with my psychiatrist (haven't been able to function studying from home so he was writing me a letter to give to my Dean of Students Office to request accommodations). I've been diagnosed with anxiety for a good while so that's what the convo was about at first.When I was talking about what it was like trying to study, he stopped me to ask if I thought had ADD. My brother has ADD and has always had trouble in school; I've always done well academically so I had never considered that.He asked me a lot of questions about how I study, get work done, function, all in the context of BEFORE quarantine and it waas honestly kinda freaky. He was essentially listing in detail a whole bunch of things I do that I've written off as quirks for ~~years~~ most of my life (starting major projects/essays 1-2 days before its due, remaining acutely aware of everything else going on around me while in a conversation, frequently forgetting about deadlines/meetings, etc. etc.)He (jokingly) said that I "passed" the test with "flying colors" and added ADD to my diagnosis.He says I have the option to go on meds, but I'm still thinking about it. Part of me wants to try to continue functioning the way I always have, but part of me recognizes that I've always had trouble being efficient in an academic environment and that being stuck at home (with 4 younger siblings between the ages of 10 and 18) has caused my ability to focus on schoolwork to take a nosedive. I literally haven't turned in a single assignment since I moved out of my dorm, not even the ones I had half-finished before quarantine.I'm wondering if anyone else has found themselves in this situation before? I don't really know how to deal with the diagnosis and I don't know what sort of lifestyle changes to make. What has helped you? [info] None [info] 1586204464

NikaVika [info] Wow, my story is basically the same. I have been picking at my face (mostly) for a looong time and only this year I realized I did it when I was feeling anxious or I had a panic attack (I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder). At that very moment it feels so good but then the realization hits and I feel horrible, which makes me anxious....which makes me want to scratch and pick. I discovered this reddit just recently but it really helped me to finally feel like I'm not alone and that something can be done about this. So, you can do it! It won't be easy, there will be relapse or two on the way, but we can do it! Great thing that I started using are the pimple patches. Put it over and bye.

misfortunas [info] Afraid of becoming schizophrenic. Can it come true? Hi! My Name is Tom im 16 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder 2 months ago. I suffer from derealisation and hypochondria. If you don't know. Hypochondria is the fear of getting a disease. Currently it is schizophrenia. I used to read SO much about this disease because I tried to self diagnose myself. (Didn't know I had anxiety at that point) like a lot! I watched videos, documentaries, read about every symptom etc. Right now I feel like developing it. Because I have weird paranoid thoughts lately. For example: if I am outside I feel like people are against me (planning something). Or they laugh about me. My mum told me these thoughts appear because I read too much about them and I focus too much around them. I believe she is right, but at the same time, it doesn't FEEL like that. I want to believe that the world is perfectly fine. But it doesn't feel that way. Please tell me it's all ok. My biggest fear is developing schizophrenia.

spookyartskeleton [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety and while it's gotten better than it used to be, I still get the occasional anxiety attack. One night I was laying in bed trying to sleep. I usually don't have problems laying alone in bed but for some reason unbeknownst to me I couldn't rest. I turned onto my side, and I felt someone breathing on me, as if they were inches from my face. I opened my eyes and there was no one. I listened to see if I heard the A/C turn on, but heard nothing. I swear to this day I felt distinct breath on my face. I turned over onto my other side and tried to forget about it. After a few minutes again I felt someone's breath inches from my face. I looked around my room. I have posters on my walls, and while I looked at them trying to calm down they seemed to morph and twist, like I was hallucinating. I thought I was dreaming so I checked my clock and pulled out my phone to try and confirm I was awake. This is when I got the sickest, most paranoid impending doom feeling I've ever felt. I felt like something extremely horrible was about to happen. My stomach did flips, I was sweating and shaking but I couldn't find the energy to move or get out of bed. I've never felt unsafe in my room, and I've had anxiety attacks before but this was by far the worst. It might not be paranormal but Jesus did it scare me. Eventually I just noped straight out of my room and slept in a different room that night. The following nights I took melatonin to help me sleep and I was fine. I'm still not sure what happened and why I got that feeling, because nothing did end up happening that night. [info] None [info] 1559493220
Tho3v [info] Am I stupid? I will start with a background of myself and explain myself as a person. -I grew up as a foreigner in Saudi Arabia, and graduated from an American school there. My father paid lots of money for me to graduate from here, but I chose to go study in Russia despite his wishes for me to study in a rich Anglophone country, because I wanted to experience something different. I also did not want my dad to spend so much money on me, because university in countries like USA and Canada are damn expensive and I am not sure my dad can cover the tuition fees without me going into debt. -My father was not very encouragung and I grew up being afraid of looking stupid in front of him, and this makes me unconsciously do very stupid things. I can forget where I put things very fast and have a habit of losing things.  -I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADD but I dont believe that ADD is real. I do have focus issues but it can be resolved by studying in a quiet library. The only real issue is that I think slow and process information slowly. I make the stupidest mistakes. I cannot function properly when someone is being imperative and asks me to do something. For example, my dad gave me his glasses and said something like "wear it on your neck" and I was literally so confused that I was putting it on my neck like how someone puts their glasses on, it took me a couple seconds to realise he meant that I should hang it upon my shirt. Of course my dad cusses me out for stupidity every chance he gets. This has made me so insecure that I do act like a complete dumbass when meeting his friends when they come over. I am 19 and am terrible at socializing. I have a bad sense of humor too. I have long term goals and I do work on them. Just a year ago I felt I was smart, but with every passing day I feel like a dumbass. -I sometimes believe in God and sometimes I don't.-I have already completed a year of uni in a Russia, and right now I am spending the summer with my parents in my home country. I had friends in Russia but I have no one here. It is too hot and dirty to go outside and I spend my days learning Russian at home. -The only thing I am talented in is biology, languages and art. I speak 4 languages, but so can many people. I suck at maths and am bad at socializing but I do have a girlfriend who is a lot like me. So please tell me honestly, am I stupid?Update: Thank you for your beautiful replies. It has been a big help and I am going to take my diagnosis more seriously. I have spoken with my dad and he is being supportive. [info] None [info] 1564254208

staringspace [info] Ultrarunning tips and tricks for long run anxiety Hi all,My background: Been running road for 5 years (half marathons, etc.), until I moved back home to the countryside. Ever since, I've been slowly building up my distances on trail and about 3 weeks ago I took part in my first trail race over half marathon distance (17 miles). It was hard (hilly and boggy, took longer than I wanted!) but I'm incredibly glad I did it, and it's opened me up to a lot of ideas regarding some ultras/multi-day adventures. I really want to do some crazy adventures like running Hadrian's Wall/running the length of some national parks in the UK.However, the one thing that's always held me back is the anxiety I get on long runs. No matter how much I prepare the night before, my GI system hates me the morning of a long run. As soon as I start, I normally feel okay, but then towards the end (normally when running distances that are unknown territory), my brain takes over and I keep worrying about if I'll faint/throw up/pass out and no one will find me. During the trail race, I started feeling pretty sick in the last 10km and even though I pulled through it without any consequences, the anxiety of keeling over in the middle of nowhere definitely slowed me down and made me lose time.For those who are seasoned at longer distances - what tricks do you use to try and keep your brain in the best shape possible on long runs (training or races)? How often do you rely on others to pull you out of any slumps you get?***TL;DR: Get anxious on long runs. What advice do you have for getting through those thoughts that you're going to pass out and die with no one to find you?*****Edit: Thank you so much for everyone’s responses so far, some stellar advice! Just so people know and something I didn’t disclose originally - I have been diagnosed with anxiety and running really helps with managing this. I also have no underlying conditions bar IBS, which has also been diagnosed and I’m under the impression this is also stress/anxiety related!** [info] None [info] 1572358003
_Classic_Rando_ [info] Good for you OP! I was diagnosed with anxiety for ages before ADHD even came into my radar.After starting treatment, my anxiety got way better, but I still feel that general dread/snowballing thing now and then. I still want to get re-evaluated but I think my diagnosis of ADHD and generalised anxiety is more or less right. I'd say my brain's tomfoolery is 80% ADHD and 20% anxiety... But my suffering/ shitty life quality was definitely 80% down to anxiety. I felt so lost when I became so much more productive and functional, but still couldn't be happy... Anxiety is a thief of joy, for real. Only now, a year after diagnosis, am I learning ways to cope with life from the inside out. Onward and upward! [info] ADHD &amp; SO [info] 1509994537

xLordValx [info] My anxiety is interfering with my sleep. I take medication for anxiety and it ignores everything. Help? So here’s my main problem, I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and take medications that I’m balancing out right now. Any time I attempt to sleep from the times of 9 AM to 8PM I’m jolted awake with a panic attack. Usually I can take my anxiety meds and just chill, but it ignores them completely during the day. I’m not anxious lately at all and haven’t no reason to be. This entire nocturnal anxiety started after my cat died in 2016 and I have had time to grieve and accept, so I don’t understand why this happens. I’m absolutely frightened to sleep and can’t nap at all if I haven’t slept due to being terrorized by these jolts of anxiety. [info] None [info] 1565801055
katiebuggc [info] GAD Pals: How often does it bother you? Hello! So in November-ish, I was diagnosed with anxiety, particularly Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). My psychiatrist mentioned the definition, and how it was characterized by a general sense of anxiety, doom, paranoia, etc. for more than however many weeks, blah blah blah.My question is: How often are my fellow GAD-ers (I'm non-medicated, but both medicated and non-medicated friends are welcome to give input!) bothered by their GAD symptoms? What feelings bother you the most?For example, over the past 9-12 months that I've exhibited symptoms, there's been maybe three or four days that I've felt "normal" (no weird symptoms, no overthinking, no cyclical thinking/worrying, the good stuff), and every day other than those I'm plagued most heavily by dread, irritability, and anxiety. Some nights I'll get very paranoid about some things. Edit: For clarification [info] None [info] 1522207051

Help_Me_Reddit01 [info] If I don’t stop, I’m going to allow my anxiety to ruin my relationship. Hi everyone! I’m a 24 year old female. I am diagnosed with anxiety and take Wellbutrin for it. I don’t have the best dating history, I’ve been screwed over more times than I can count and I’m now extremely guarded. This now just leads me to overthink every little thing and say what it to every single situation. Within the last week or so, I reconnected with a 27 year old male who I went to college with. He’s always tried to pursue something with me but we wanted different things at the time. He texted me this week asking me to just give him a chance after we had a brief conversation on Snapchat. We went back and forth for TWO days about possibly trying something out. He lives two hours away right now and really it’s not ideal. He asked me to meet him halfway to grab dinner, which we did last night. We now text just about 24/7 some of its sexual but for the most part it isn’t. We ate dinner and it was fine. Afterwards, we sat in my car for over two hours talking about everything. He explained how he’s 27 now and really just needs to get it together and settle down. He admitted he has feelings and such. I overthink things so I was skeptical of everything. He basically told me I’m in a huge emotional hole that I really need to start climbing out of because it’s just going to push people away. I brought up the idea that maybe he’s just putting on a front to get into my pants and honestly he wasn’t too happy that I said that and basically said if I wanted you for sex, I wouldn’t have driven over and hour for dinner and then sit here talking about a relationship with you for a couple hours. Overall the talk was good and now I just have thinking to do. Ultimately after hearing me ramble for over an hour he flat out asked me if I was even ready or could handle a relationship?I really said I don’t know more than I could count. I’m pretty sure that’s all I could say. I told him I really just needed to think about things and seemed a little confused/disappointed because he was putting it all out on the table and the only thing I could say was “I don’t know”.  We did kiss, he played with my hair and kissed my forehead. It was all fine. He asked to see me again today but, I’m leaving for vacation tomorrow morning for a week so I needed to pack and so on. So I’m supposed to see him when I get back from my trip. He asked which part of Florida I’ll be in, which is Miami. He’s concerned I’ll find a guy in Florida and that Miami is completely unsafe (he’s a cop). I’m constantly thinking everything he’s saying and doing are all a front but I have nothing to support that other than he was only into casual relationships in 2015, which I did also address yesterday. How in the hell do I allow myself to chill the hell out without reading into or overthinking every single thing he does or says. I’m driving myself nuts and I really don’t know how long he’s going to remain patient with me. [info] None [info] 1563224902

Williampram23 [info] Push through and feel normal once more I’m mostly talking to drinkers and smokers here. It’s been almost a month since my last smoke and half a year since my last drink and I feel absolutely amazing. The driving for me to quit alcohol was my performance in university had gone down significantly and as a result I failed and had to start all over again, not only that I felt my body getting weaker and weaker and my skin looking disgusting every morning. As for cigarettes, I could easily smoke a pack a day. Cigarette was a huge part of my life, so much so that I started bumming them off people, picking them up from the ground, and rolling up old tobacco from cigarette butts, it was embarrassing. Every night when I sleep I had to sit up straight to breathe properly and it got so bad that my entire body would go numb and tingly.I was the extreme example of addiction I guess you could say, I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD which made the quit even harder, but I made it in the end. It was shocking how amazing I felt even after a couple days. It was like I was living a new, healthier life. This wasn’t because of Jesus, muhammad, moses, buddha or vishnu, it was my own decision to quit and my own dedication to the quit which made it happen.How did I do it? Avoid smokers, meditate, exercise, jacking off, having sex, playing games, focusing on your hobbies. These are the things which got me through this.Good luck everyone. [info] None [info] 1557710524

bigangryhobbit [info] I am no stranger to mental illness, and I know what its like to not be able to finish school because of it.  I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder with agoraphobia 20 years ago.  It was tough.  I went to college 3 times and never could keep it together becuase of classroom anxiety/panic.  I tried every medication imaginable during those 20 years.  I have been self employed for half of that time.  I could never work a physically demanding job unfortuantely.  Somehow, I continue to push on.  Its nice to have come into contact with you.  Its hard to find people that truly understand what living with a mental disability is like, and how much of an obstacle it is.  We aren't lunatics, we just have a health disorder like anybody else that may have something wrong with them.  Good luck to you!

antiqueguy19001 [info] Thanks for the very helpful post! It helped a lot reading this, thanks for typing it all out. Anxiety has plagued me my whole life, even at age 5 I didn't leave my house for weeks, scared that the planets would fall! I don't get as many all-out panic attacks anymore (though still some small ones more often), but the constant anxiety that I get about most things is very bad. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was younger, and want to see a therapist for it, but am scared that they will find a whole new problem with me. My parents told me that I should definitely see one anyway though, because it will make me feel a lot better to deal with my anxiety.As for my lymphoma worry, in the year that I didn't pay any attention to any larger nodes, I didn't worry once, or even feel any swollen nodes. It seems like my anxiety seems to get worse towards the end of the year anyway though, as the days get shorter and colder. I was a little relieved today when I read in many places that follicular lymphoma (the type I have been the most scared about), doesn't occur in it's normal form in people under 20 or 30, only a pediatric version (which is highly curable in almost all cases, unlike the normal follicular lymphoma, which occurs almost only in age 50 or older and is tougher to treat), and even then is only diagnosed around 25 times a year (which I said before). When my anxiety really gets bad though, I will be completely convinced I am one of those people. Luckily my dad made me feel better by showing my a rather large neck node he has had for decades that has been fine, and before he gained a lot of weight, says that he also could feel plenty of groin nodes too. My mom also has some rather large lymph nodes on her armpit which aren't cancer either.I am generally always at my happiest when I don't think about all the things I can't control that could go wrong, such as getting randomly killed by a murderer or drunk driver while walking on the street, or in this case cancer. Most of the time though I am forgetting about all the things that could go wrong, and enjoying myself biking, hiking and overall doing fun activities. It seems like it is late a night when I have most of my worst anxiety. I have never smoked or drank alcohol (or any other drug for that matter), not wanting to risk my health in a preventable way, a more positive side effect of anxiety I guess.Thanks again for the great reply!&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1542253010

SeaBeeDecodesLife [info] You’re absolutely not over-thinking it. She wants you to handle your child’s aggression and control issues by aggressively shoving him in the shower and showing him that you can overpower him. It just makes me sad that people act like children that young have no feelings, and the only way to get through to them is by physically overpowering them and proving that you’re the boss. But in reality, whatever your son’s dealing with is an emotional issue, and he’s throwing tantrums because he’s unable to verbally express what he’s going through and he’s frustrated. If there was an adult who started crying because they were in the middle of an argument and they were unable to express their feelings accurately, would we presume they were just trying to be difficult and grab them and shove them in the shower? No. Kids have feelings too, and deserve to be emotionally validated and have time to learn how to express what’s going on inside of them, not be physically overpowered. God, I’m sorry. You’re a wonderful mother though, and she shouldn’t have tried to target you like that in a vulnerable time. In all reality, she might’ve genuinely thought she was being helpful, but you just *don’t* handle a child that way when they’re struggling emotionally.Hell, I remember throwing tons of tantrums when I was four just because I was so frustrated. I was witnessing things kids shouldn’t have had to witness, and I didn’t know how to verbally express what was happening or what I was feeling, so I just cried and screamed to get the anger and frustration and grief out whenever something triggered me. I was diagnosed with anxiety that same year, when everyone else had been telling my mother to whoop my ass. I can’t imagine how horrifically traumatised id be if she really had done that, or shoved me in a cold shower, when I was struggling like that—because I *remember* what I was feeling.

boop_attack [info] How do I keep myself from getting really anxious during a nosebleed? I feel really, really silly asking this. Backstory: Every winter, due to a combination of dry air, allergies, blowing my nose, medication, and sometimes the flu or a cold, I tend to get nosebleeds. Most of the time they're no big deal and stop after a few minutes. Sometimes they're bad and don't stop for 10-20 minutes. I know how to handle them, but I can't help becoming extremely anxious - heart pounding, shortness of breath, dry mouth, shaking, stomach and bowels twisting up and feeling like they're about to evacuate their contents - almost building up to a panic attack. I try to tell myself it will be ok, I've handled nosebleeds before, I can deal with this too and it'll all be fine. But just when I start to calm down something will trigger the anxiety again - the blood, fear that it won't stop bleeding, etc. An explanation of that latter fear: A few years ago I became really sick. I was prescribed Advil, a blood thinner, and because of the dry air and illness and bad luck, ended up having nose hemorrhages several times and had to go to the hospital to get my nose packed. So when I see blood gushing out, I'm terrified that my nose is hemorrhaging again and won't stop, though it hasn't happened since and I'm careful that none of the meds I take are blood thinners or have that side effect.Also, I'm not digging for gold in my nose, I promise haha! The nosebleeds can start if I sniff or blow my nose or get very hot or get out of bed in the morning If I can't seem to calm down after a nosebleed, I'll take an anti-anxiety medication (I have been diagnosed with anxiety but have gotten better at managing it without medication, which I now use if other techniques aren't working.)Please be gentle... I feel massively pathetic asking this question. But I just want to know if I'm not alone or if anyone has helpful advice. Thank you a bunch :)PS: before anyone asks, yes I do get my flu vaccination every year :) but still may catch it once a year.EDIT: forgot to mention that I do use a humidifier and lubricating nose sprays and petroleum jelly. Also, sorry for this being so long. [info] None [info] 1547443821

But yeah, I'm basically uncomfortable with eye contact, which my loved ones know and allow, or I'm staring at strangers like a crazy robot.  It's awesome. [info] None [info] 1544423382
imnotpants [info] I’m interesting in applying for the air force but I just found out that when I went to therapy a few years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety. Now I went back to therapy and I was diagnosed with multiple other mental disorders. Do these factors keep me from being eligible for the Air Force? What have you experienced with mental health confidentiality when joining the Air Force? Am I allowed to keep these things a secret? Thanks for any answers! [info] None [info] 1540422404
misterbecca [info] Given I'm not as old as you are (I was just diagnosed at age 25), I never really considered that I could be on the spectrum until my most recent therapist suggested it. My brother was diagnosed in high school and I work with children with autism for my job, but they all seem so different from me that I didn't think I was also autistic. Similar to you, I was diagnosed with anxiety and always just assumed that I had social anxiety because I was awkward and that was that. I have sensory issues but always just told myself I was being too sensitive. I stim, but learned to primarily do it in "socially acceptable" ways like knee bouncing, and always told myself that was just my anxiety. I have other compulsive behaviors (I was also diagnosed with OCD on top of the ASD so who knows what the root of that is, but point is, it was all chalked up to general anxiety until recently). Basically, I blamed all of my "quirks" on my anxiety and didn't think I could be on the spectrum like the other autistic people I knew because it presented differently in all of them. I'm also struggling with taking the news in, and feel like I'm going back and analyzing every experience I've had and thinking about how it's been affected by my ASD. I also am paranoid now that other people see me as really awkward--up until now, I've felt like I've masked the awkwardness pretty well, and as awkward as I've felt, I've had some confidence that others can't see it. But now I don't know. I like to think I'm self-aware and decent at reading other people's emotions, but now that I've been diagnosed with ASD, I don't know if that's possible. It's hard not to keep internalizing the generalizations about ASD that I've heard about all of the other autistic people in my life. [info] Recently Diagnosed [info] 1555532809
BlueReflection0 [info] Enneagram 3 or 6? I'm glad I've found a group for 6s :) henlo!! For those who know enneagram well (I dont tbh) could you help me work this out?I'm not interested in success much. But I've always had a really strong pull towards needing to stand out and needing to be seen for someone unique and special, sometimes it stresses me out because this feeling gets me on everything, even organising folders I'm just like I need to be the best at organising! I'm not a 4, I've checked a lot. I like a bit of sadness, but I'm afraid of going too deep into melancholy, I find it easier to be positive most of the time. I've always had a built in need to be true to myself, except it's running in the background behind my other wants, like wanting to be liked and accepted, and admired. Sometimes i get into inner conflict between these two things :0. I'm not ambitious either tbh, and I'm more idealistic/romantic than pragmatic.I'm diagnosed with anxiety so I often show up on tests as a 6w5/6w7. Whats confusing is that, yes, I definitely have the need for safety and security somewhere inside of me, but I feel like the most important thing to me is being liked by people and loved, and standing out as someone unique, special and admirable. That FEELS more important than safety. but my actions never show it much. Also, I'm a loner. I prefer to be by myself than with others, yet i want to stand out and i want to belong at the same time. Confusing, I know. I'm a loner just out of choice - I dont have distrust in people at all, i just prefer my own company most of the time. [info] None [info] 1572974554

CrowWithARose [info] Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar? 24 Year Old  Caucasion Female, 5'2, 150 lbsDuration  ~ 2 monthsCurrently taking birth control and thyroid medication (levothyroxine 50MG)WAS taking anxiety medication (Zoloft 50MG) (Not anymore because my doctor left, didn't tell me and no one knows where she now works)I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was around 14. I've been anxious since I was around 5, or at least that's my earliest memory of it. I was always just labeled as shy until I actually brought it up at an appointment when I was 14 (er, well, my mom did)I'm going to the doctor again, but I'm not really sure what I should say or ask.I'm afraid of getting a wrong diagnosis. I'm NOT using this as a diagnosis, I just want to have an idea before I go.Ok, I've been feeling...bad? Not all the time, just about 60% of the time I'd say.It did start somewhat before I had to stop taking my anxiety medication. It has gotten significantly worse thought. I stopped taking it about a month ago. My symptoms include:*Aching-  (kinda like I'm sore) all over*Fatigue - (I could sleep 12 hours and still be exhausted)*Distracted - I start on one thing and get bored or just start doing something else without even really thinking about it*I get a depressed feeling - I don't want to do anything, I feel bad about myself, I feel like I'm not doing enough, Wonder why I'm even trying, Don't want to get up, Hopless *Easily irritated - It's like small things can make me annoyed but things that should make me angry don't bother me as much*Anxiety - Usually a "shaking" feeling inside (I'm not sure how to describe it), trouble breathing, heart racing, racing thoughts, fidgiting *OCD type patters - Counting to 3 before I allow myself to do things, touching random things as I pass, moving objects - all so something "bad" doesn't happen.I feel shitty now that I've actually typed everything and I see all the things wrong with me. I have a very stressful job and I feel like it may have brought this on.Please help. I'd really appreciate it. I haven't told anyone so I'd like anonymous input, as weird as that is. I just don't want my loved ones to know how bad I am mentally right now. I also want to know what to expect. I'm obviously very nervous and don't want to get hit hard by what the doctor may say.

garlotch [info] Still, d1fty has a good point. Check out /r/chch. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, as well as a list of other illnesses. I was put on resperidone, a drug to calm my anxiety. It was so powerful, that for all the time I was taking it (3 years) I was quite literally a zombie. The best decision I have made, was to stop taking it, and throw it in the bin. Despite my anxiety, the surges of hot prickles up my body, I have definitely changed. I made it to the second audition of New Zealand's got talent, in Wellington (2012), and I went up on stage in front of thousands of people, that was probably the most frightening thing of my life. I also play in a highland-pipe-band, and go to events every year, thousands of people watch me there too. But you know what? I don't feel scared of them any more. I honestly could not care what those people think of me, and when I get out there in the spotlight, I am proud of what I do, and have accomplished. Now, I welcome fear, I welcome anxiety. It reminds me that I am human. Fear is one of the most vivid feelings in your life, and if you embrace it... you will live a lot happier. My doctors have urged me to get back on ANTI-ANXIETY medication, but I wouldn't take that again. Even if I was paid 300 dollars a week, I wouldn't take it.Point being, I got over my anxiety from 'Practice'. From being out there in the crowds. The more you experience it oxychromaticdynamite, the less it will effect you so.Sorry If I rambled/ranted on, I'm really bored, and this is the perfect thread to vent my thoughts onto. &lt;3 [info]  [info] 1432191032

summer1171 [info] I have gp. Have you ever had an endoscopy? Honestly anxiety shows it’s self in many ways. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 7. My main symptoms were nausea and vomiting. But because it came with lots of crying it was thrown off as anxiety. Not until age 22 was I given an endoscopy and then a gastric emptying scan ultimately diagnosing me with gp. So I in no way want to tell you it could just be anxiety. But what I will say is that there are many other gi illnesses than gp. It seems to be the new thing everyone comes up with! Your symptoms definitely mimick some symptoms but it could be a number of things. Research the gp diet and follow that while you wait for an appt with a gi doctor. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for you that it’s not gp. Just know if it is there’s a separate group on here as well as Facebook devoted to gp :)  [info] None [info] 1539316816
Pigstah [info] First time suffering with severe anxiety... As the title say's I've been diagnosed with anxiety and have been feeling really shit for the past two months but past week has been the worst. My  **fiancée** has been dealing with much the same, if not worse, for the past 10 years and in turn she has been trying her best to help me.I had my best day yesterday as I was laying in the sun with my partner, doing absolutely nothing and was super relaxed. Then today back to work, my chest is back to being tight, clenched jaw and fluttering stomach. I've recently started this job (6 months ago nearly) and is my first step into my new career in IT. I love the job to pieces but have been taking more and more on which is turn has made me feel very overwhelmed. I'm also getting married this year, which I'm over the moon about but this too could be a reason for the anxiety all of sudden. Last week, I had a slight panic attack at work and got sent home, I then also had a big panic attack Saturday night and my partner had to cradle me in bed to calm me down :(...I didn't really have a question but more of a way to vent and to see how some of you have handled your own anxiety? My doctor advised I start taking anti-depressants, which I have and seek some therapy. I just want my normal self back, and to not associate my anxiety at the moment with work.

sweet-cutie-pie [info] Finally recovery feels like something real! This year has been hella crazy! I was going to marry my fiance but he dumped me in mid-January. I have to move in with my parents (they were a major trigger from my ED) and then COVID-19 come in and I have been lock-in for the past two months.But, not everything is bad... I'm still getting (online) therapy. The doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and nutritionists that are helping are freaking amazing and I'm thankful for their work. I'm taking Paroxetine (12.5 mg) every morning and Trazodone (50 mg) for better sleeping. I was diagnosed with anxiety and EDNOS.My parents have become a major part of my support system, I was finally able to talk to them about my anxiety and ED. They've been really supportive and I no longer feel like they're a burden or trigger...I still miss my ex-fiance and that's honestly the most painful thing in my life right now, but I also feel all of this happened for a reason and maybe I needed this storm to lay back on and start working on being a better me.The most important thing is that I haven't binged and purged since December 2019. I'm still learning to eat healthily and trying not to put that much pressure to lose weight. Yeah, sometimes I feel like losing it and I overeat, but that's honestly nothing compared to the binges I used to have.The next step is setting actual goals: weight loss, better eating, more sleeping, etc. I'm shitless scare, but feel like I finally might be able to achieve those.I hope one day all of this will be just part of my past: things that help me grow and be the woman I wanna be.Hope all of you reading this can find peace during this quarantine. It will get better, I promise. [info] None [info] 1588104483
paincoats [info] To me, that sounds like anxiety. I get that to a lesser degree, and I have been diagnosed with anxiety. Intrestingly, the counsellor initially thought I was on the spectrum. I wouldn't be surprised if anxiety was commonly comorbid with autism. [info] None [info] 1423107859
Unnamed-Visitor [info] "Fantastic. Back to square one." This was my response to finding out how many mental issues I haven't been diagnosed with but very potentially could have.I found out a few years ago that I have an interest in mental disorders, so I would read up on any I happen to find, and keep a close eye on ones that I find interesting. The problem lies in the fact that when reading the symptoms and effects that these disorders have, I've come to realize just how many of these symptoms and issues I've accepted as normal everyday occurrences. I used to think my social struggles and strange habits were just me being me, but now I'm pretty sure it's not just me. I have enough social difficulties and struggles that I could be put on the autism spectrum (though that says very little due to the massive ground covered by the spectrum) or even have Asperger's. Either way, it's terrifying for me, someone who's struggling to just find a job that I can comfortably work at, to think that there could be a dozen mental disorders I don't even know I have.And right now, I think that's what keeps dragging me into my depressive hole again; not knowing. If I knew what was wrong with me, maybe I'd be able to handle it better. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few months back, and since then I've been working it into regression, despite not getting to see any therapist or psychologist about any treatment options. All that happened when I asked my parents about getting help was I went to see my doctor, I was diagnosed with anxiety, and told to seek help resources, then nothing else. Don't get me wrong, knowing helped me get a little boost, but after that I wasn't sure what to do. I'm not sure what it is, but I feel absolutely helpless without some sort of support from someone I consider a superior. I'm terrified of living alone because the times I've been away from those people, my anxiety flares up and I go into full panic mode. I'm otherwise unsure where to start on the gigantic puzzle of my brain.If I figure out what to do, I feel like it's not gonna be enough to fix all of this nonsensical bullshit with my brain, but I gotta try, at least so I can one day tell everyone that I tried.

xisaloser [info] I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder (not social anxiety, speaking more of depersonalization/derealization/paranoia) and make up helps me but in a different way. It's not about "I have make up on so I gotta get out of my shell," but more "I am dissociating so I am gonna try 5 different eye-looks to focus on something else and get out of my head." I find it works better than trying to focus on reading or watching when my minds tends to wonder and pictures in motion can sometimes make me feel dizzy. I basically lay out all my eyeshadows and try to come up with looks, it actually needs my focus and some creativity so instead of over-analyzing myself or my surroundings I am like "do these go well together? maybe I should try to mix two contrasting colors, that would be interesting? Maybe I'd find a new use for this shadow" etc. etc. and then the blending is really relaxing to me as well. Same with looking in the mirror, of course that's mostly therapy doing, but I am not afraid to face myself when I go through phase of depersonalization. Before I'd see myself in the mirror and think "is this me? am I looking at myself? this is uncomfortable I need to look away," and now I am like "yeah that's uncomfortable but hey I gotta ride this one out." I guess we all have different ways to cope with anxiety, but I just see this particular task as really good to cope cause my mind doesn't wander.  [info] None [info] 1495642810

Michelle_ma_belle16 [info] Ongoing, mild hallucinations related to anxiety I can’t find anything online about this, but I believe I’m experiencing mild hallucinations during anxiety attacks. This has been going on for years. I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD, but the hallucinations aren’t related to what I have PTSD from as far as I can remember (childhood abuse).When I’m in high stress and anxiety and I try to go to bed, I can see and feel my flesh being sliced open. If I open my eyes, it moves to my face and cuts open my eyes too. I tried to imagine my boyfriend holding my hand as a comfort, and I watched his hand being sliced open. The only thing that helps is time and touching where I’m being “cut” if it isn’t too severe. No matter how hard I try, I can’t reason myself out of it. It’s terrifying, and I’m not sure what else to do. This has been happening for about three or four years now, and isn’t improving. I’m not getting used to it.Does anyone have any info? Thanks!

Volleyballer08 [info] Was Diagnosed As A Kid, Now Problems As An Adult After work today I really want to put my foot down and get whatever is going on with me under control. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with anxiety. I didn't know this until about a year ago when my mom told me. I had gone through a brief period of therapy for panic attacks that resulted from being a hypochondriac. I work in healthcare now and don't have that issue anymore. My mom I guess had asked if she thought medication was needed and my therapist at the time said she didn't think so. I grew up a teenager always worried and I dealt with stress poorly, but I would say I was 'fine' as far as that goes. I had lots of friends, was very physically active, and wouldn't have really considered myself having any mental health issues.Flash forward to me at age 22-now at age 29. I'm finding it suddenly hard to make friends and have been alone for a very long time with only rare occasions of meeting up with people. Recently I moved due to a career change and now I'm feeling even worse than before; panicked, afraid everyone hates me, so anxious by the time I leave work everyday I'm in tears. My parents know this sort of thing has been going on for a while and God bless them, they've advised me to go to therapy again and try things like online dating apps and such but I'm so damn insecure these days I'm afraid I'll just feel worse. Seeing them upset makes me feel worse and the cycle goes on and on.Living in a new town with what could be a fresh start I already feel like I'm slipping into the isolation and constant state of anxiousness I was before. I don't even know where to begin in terms of seeking help and I feel like such a failure. I want to move past this mental barrier that keeps me from being myself but have zero clue how. I don't get why I'm this way after so many years of being fine. [info] None [info] 1539800664
leyjanz [info] Just when I feel I have my anxiety under control, it comes back stronger than before. Hey all! I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder about 4 years ago. I've experienced it since I was a child but was labeled the worrier/emotional kid. Since being diagnosed, I've felt empowered to take steps to cope with my anxiety, and the in last 6 months I've had less frequent attacks/episodes.I have noticed that when I do experience anxiety now, it comes out of nowhere, more intensely than ever. I wake up shaking, I sleep maybe 4 hours a night, and I completely disconnect from everyone around me because I'm afraid of being negative/that they will be mad at me. My husband is so supportive but I hate having to tell him that I am yet again dealing with my mental health. I wish I could just solve it and be done.What long term steps have you taken to cope? It feels like I am safe until I fall into this trap, slowly make my way out and I'm fine until the next round. Does anyone experience this like...relapse? Sorry for the negative rant!! Thank you in advance!EDIT : I feel like I should add that I have been exercising at least 3-4 times a week now which has been a huge help, but I'm finding that I start to spiral if I don't go to the gym.

CeeDiddy82 [info] You may possibly just be having anxiety/panic attacks.I have had experiences like this for a long time. Being atheist, I didn't have the spirit thing going for me. I actually thought aliens were going to abduct me. For a while, doctors attributed the symptoms to complications from being overweight (blood sugar spikes, high blood pressure, etc).I have dropped almost all the weight I needed to and became more active so I am actually tired at night and sleep. I also cut out carbs, as they are basically sugar and cause blood sugar spikes with me (/r/keto or /r/paleo can be helpful).Even though all of that has helped a lot, I still get anxiety attacks. Not sure what triggers them. I had one the other day at work I actually passed out and they called an ambulance and I went to the ER. After that I started getting panic attacks nightly, over nothing inparticular, usually I was just scared I would pass out again. My dreams I would have following waking up during a panic attack were scary. I dreamed I heard loud screaming, I dreamed I was in car wrecks and plane crashes. I dreamed some vortex was sucking me in. Just downright scary shit in that state between sleeping and awake.Finally, after "stone cold perfect" blood tests from the ER and from the follow up doctor visit, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.Doctor prescribed xanax and I have to go to a therapist who specializes in anxiety.I recommend getting healthier eating/exercise habits and telling a doctor about panic attacks at night. The xanax works wonders for me. I don't take it everyday, only when I start to feel anxiety. Kind of like aspirin to headaches, only take when needed. Xanax is a highly addictive chemical, so hopefully when I finish my therapy I won't ever need it. If you have an addictive personality you need to get into anxiety therapy ASAP.

Been going to therapy again for the past 5 weeks, 2-3 times a week with my old therapist to practice improving my social skills. She's recommended me a lot of books. I'm currently reading 2 at a time. During lunch or during the gym in between sets. Writing down notes and practicing small things with people at the gym and at work. It's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. My therapist told me to inform a few people about me going to therapy so I could have a strong support system. People who can tell me when I'm doing something rude, or come off too strong. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and what my therapist thinks is OCPD (Obessive Compulsive Personality Disorder). Which she also attributes to my temper, anxiety, and OCD like behaviors.My therapist thinks I keep strong guard so I don't get hurt given my childhood. When I let people in. I get nervous and anxious because I don't know how things will turn out. I've had anxiety attacks and they aren't the best. To the point of passing out, hyperventilating, losing sensation in my face legs and arms. I guess I'm just looking to expand my support system a little more. Some days feel hard, other days feel really hard. Sometimes I feel like I might slip up and say something mean, or someone might get misinterpreted, or I wasn't clear enough in expressing my thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress. Recently, I've been avoiding confrontational topics or subjects. Things I know I might sound too assertive on. [info] None [info] 1454521398
b_port [info] I mean, before I was diagnosed with anxiety they ran a bunch of tests on me to make sure it wasn't something else. I had to pay a decent chunk of change for all those tests, but it was definitely worth it to find out that the only thing that's wrong with me is anxiety.  [info] None [info] 1534266429

Kardinale [info] I was the classic underachiever in high school, but was still offered a full ride to an in state university. Where I struggled was freshman year, since I had spent high school just skating by and not giving a shit about my future in general. My first college semester ended with me skipping my finals and getting a .69 GPA. I took a year long break, during which I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I retroactively withdrew from my first semester, giving myself a clean slate. I’ve been back for a year and a half now and I’m about to attain my 4.0, thanks to me giving a damn about my future and some studying. On another note, I’m done trying to have a social life lol. It’s just not possible for me [info] None [info] 1544495649

mydogscollegefund [info] Kinda sounds like both to me. I was diagnosed with anxiety after crohns and when I flare my anxiety about how my body will react jumps up and I find myself over worrying about every sensation and feeling. Make sure the people in your life understand your medical condition and that sometimes it takes you longer to get out of the house. I have had to stop getting ready entirely, text my boss or a friend and say “hey I’m sorry my body isn’t cooperating I’m running a bit late!” And nobody seems to be upset.

penisinthepeanutbttr [info] What running shoes would you guys recommend for someone just getting back into running? I'm a 22 year old male, trying to get my shit together because its Spring and I'm tired of the bullshit. I used to be a fitness fanatic a few years ago. I lifted for 2 hours 4-5 days a week and ran about 4 miles a day 3-4 days a week outside with hills. I remember feeling great all the time and it impacted my life in many positive ways. However I still struggle now with getting back into it. I have this paralyzing anxiety whenever I even think about running or working out. I cant explain where it comes from. Sob stories aside, I made the mistake the first time of doing it for "a girl" who had no interest in me but motivated the hell out of me ***blah blah blah no one gives a shit...*** I think thats what I'm missing now but I would like to motivate myself another way to kick my own ass out the door and run a mile or two without feeling a sense of doom, heart flutters and general inexplicable anxiety and fear. I've been diagnosed with anxiety but for some reason it really rears its ugly head when I contemplate exercise. At the moment all I'm doing is every morning before work (4 days a week) I do 30-40 push-ups, 15 pull ups, and 15 seated rows, its not a lot, but I feel good for doing it. I know it does practically nothing but it does exhaust me quite a bit and I feel quite drowsy after doing it. If I don't do it I feel extremely guilty. So I've managed to create a habit for myself, which gives me some hope!**TLDR: Trying to make a new habit of exercising, too anxious to start**So I figured yesterday that I would make myself start by investing in a new pair of running shoes. The running shoes I currently own are from 2009 and are kind of rotted to say the least I was wondering what you guys would recommend in terms of beginner running shoes to get me back in gear. My budget is $60-$80 dollars.Thanks so much in advance! [info] None [info] 1399403896
revmyk [info] I can only speak for myself, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder (also PTSD) about two years ago. I was prescribed Xanax, then decided to give it a weed a try after reading about experiments conducted for anxiety and ptsd. My symptoms were chest pains and panic, usually when I had to go shopping for groceries or sometimes in other public places. I have found great relief from using weed. I prefer vaporizing.

misterchief10 [info] Success Story: I Landed an Interview A week ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I failed a standardized assessment for an internship I wanted, and I figured an interview I was planning was off the table. Well, now the person I was in contact with at this company said he still wants an interview with me. It feels amazing. I’m really anxious about it, because I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I have really bad social anxiety. And this is really the first interview I’ve had. The one for my previous internship was a friend of a friend at a small publication. This is a formal company interview.I’ve been studying the possible questions on Glassdoor and prepping mentally, now I just to wait.But I have to say, it at least feels great to be this far. I never thought I would get this far. My horrible social anxiety made me fear I would never have what it takes to even get an interview with a big company. I’m not outgoing and my last internship was something that sort of came to me. Even if I don’t get the job, I will still feel proud of myself for the first time in a while, because I’ve proved to myself that I can do it, I can get myself out there. And that’s great. Now, obviously I’d be disappointed if I don’t get it, but this is still a victory for me. Now to try to make sure my anxiety doesn’t shut my brain off during the interview and turn me into a quiet, stuttering mess... [info] None [info] 1520286654

TrainerAbu [info] I'm worried about my leg pulsating I sit/lay down a lot.  I'm on the computer all the time, I have no friends at all so I don't go outside much.I'm 30 years old, and I can visibly see my leg pulsing, right above my knee.I've told my doctor many times that I can feel my body pulsating often, usually with my legs, and that I'm worried that I have a blood clot.  He told me to excercise more often.I'm also extremely amenic, and I don't eat any vegetables.  I worry about my health, but my doctor always says that's just because I was diagnosed with anxiety.Should I be worried about my leg visibly pulsing right where my right knee is?

jennlody [info] I definitely do. I started getting sicker when I was 15, and no one believed me. I never threw up so they couldn't actually see any symptoms so they thought it was in my head. They thought I was being bullied or was scared to go to school so I was making up being sick so I didn't have to go. They bribed me with donuts ironically. I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on meds. After months of treatments not working, my mom asked to rule anything else out and they found the Celiac. Now over 6 years later I actually do have awful anxiety, especially when I go to see new doctors and when eating around other people. Luckily my family believes me now but they don't fully understand how stressed I get over these things. At least my parents apologized back then for being mad at me for skipping out on plans once they realized I really was sick at the time. [info] None [info] 1562727080
joelthezombie15 [info] Been diagnosed with anxiety for years but only really noticing it now, How do you cope? I've been diagnosed with anxiety for probably 13 years now, It was never a diagnosis that entirely clicked with me but I definitely did feel very anxious occasionally and I had and still have bad social anxiety. Recently though, through talking to people with anxiety and things, I've realized I was looking for the wrong symptoms in my anxiety. I was thinking you could only be diagnosed with anxiety if you had panic attacks damn near daily and crying fits and genuinely feeling like you were being hunted 24/7. I've now learned thats of course not the case and I'm noticing I feel anxious ALL the time. My hands and arms feel weak, my lungs almost feel like they're shivering, I have this overwhelming urge to run away all the time, I'm struggling to focus, everything freaks me out. These things all happened before but I didn't notice them as much and I didn't attribute them to anxiety (for whatever reason) but now that I know those are the symptoms of anxiety I notice them ALL the time and I'm really struggling this last week or two. Since I never really suffered from regular anxiety I never really picked up good coping skills. It was always triggered by something specific like being in public, so I'd go home and isolate myself to calm down. But now there is seemingly no trigger. So I don't know what to do.I'm not really asking for actual medical advice or anything, just things that seem to help you guys out. I've tried listening to calming music and laying in bed but I find that I just freak out that I can't hear what's going on around me, and if I sit in silence that freaks me out too. I hope this post is acceptable here, I'm just really desperate to find something to at least help a bit that I can do easily. Thanks. [info] None [info] 1549959787
Thunderfin [info] This is me right now (though I am going to the weight room, I haven't been as productive work-wise).  I've been diagnosed with anxiety and use procrastination to ease my worries -- maybe you have something similar.The truth is, that voice won't go away.  Even for the most disciplined guys in the world, there's a voice inside their heads as they get out of bed at 5 am to workout, telling them to go back to sleep.Some things that have helped me are:-Have a to-do / goal list.  What do you want to accomplish immediately and/or in the next week.  What about the next month?  Type or write this out and make sure it's visible.  Another way to think about it: what are your goals?  Set yourself some deadlines.  Eg. I want to impress ____ or reach ____, and I have until ____ to reach it.  Obviously you ultimately should be doing things for yourself and not for external validation, but it's better to do this than nothing at all.-Have a rough schedule.  Make one the night before for the next day.  Include enough break time at the start, because it's very difficult to go from 0 to 100 just like that.-I haven't tried this, but get someone to hold you accountable.  Family member, friend, even someone random on this sub.  They'll message you every day at ____ telling you to get off your ass and start working.All the best man! [info] None [info] 1533181387
Palonirya [info] This post actually made me tear up a little bit.I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2009, by actual doctors in an actual hospital and not just some internet forum, and even though I am so much better mentally than I was back then, there are still times when I will disassociate to the point where my own name doesn't feel as though it belongs to me.Knowing that there are people my age out there who will actively feign having anxiety and other mental illnesses and who think that having a mental illness means you literally have to talk about it all the time makes me sick. It is NOT so easy and so intriguing to talk about that you can write reams and reams on Tumblr about how your life is 'full of darkness' and how your body aches. A lot of the time you don't even want to talk about it because it can make you feel worse.The last thing I want to do when I'm having issues with my anxiety is turn it into a freaking poem for the internet to enjoy and praise me for. It is NOT worth my time. [info] None [info] 1471390836

Giddyin [info] How do you feel about anxiety medication? I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder for many years along with 9 other things. I'm a 20f and I've only ever taken medicine for asthma and ADHD. I only take my asthma meds now. I have never had anxiety medication but it was suggested I could try it this year by my caseworker. For a few years now I've managed to push myself out of my comfort zone and get things done that needed to be done. But now I think that's gotten me as far as it can go alone. For example, I'll go to appointments alone, pick up food my boyfriend and I ordered, make appointments, pick up medication, call in medication, ect. Basically I can do things that need to be done by myself now without some unnecessary sense of dread. But if I'm alone and hungry I won't go out, I won't shop alone, I don't do anything I don't need to alone. I've lived my life of numerous disabilitys for so long I can't remember what it feels like to not feel how I feel. I don't know what's me or what's my disabilitys anymore. I think I should try anxiety medication if it takes away the negative feeling about going out alone. Does anyone have sorta this same situation? What are your thoughts on anxiety medication for every day use? I'm tierd of feeling sick of just thinking about going out alone for food. I don't even make posts on here much because I think I'm doing it wrong or what I have to say or ask is stupid. Probably a confidence issue too but I don't know where one thing ends and the other begins. I'm in therapy and my therapist thinks I should take the meds. I do too. But I know nothing about it.

cmunk13 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety first, because that's a more prominent issue in my life and obvious in my personality. It does way better with established routine, and consistency and preparation. However, it never really worked for me. It always made my grades WORSE, I was disorganized, and just unable to relax. Now, I know that that's the ADHD bit. So I have to compromise. A planned ahead schedule, so it changes per day but planned. Consistent windows for some things that are hard to schedule- meals, study times. Knowing when it's ok to blow things off and just do something weird, while not shirking my responsibilities or using it as an avoidance technique.  [info] None [info] 1523236237

OwlCupWithTea [info] I'm not sure i belong here I'm only 16, so some may say i still have a chance and things could improve. I understand that. I feel so alone. I been depressed all my life and had to start therapy at a young age because of an abusive brother. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 4/5. I'm  the result of two people who don't understand what being civil and not talking shit means. I've grown up around smokers including my parents, my uncle, my aunt and my two oldest brothers( i have three), at this point i have such a hatred for not only the smell but the act yet i probably have the lungs of a smoker of at least 5 years. I started homeschooling this year because i got extremely anxious at school and couldn't get out of my own head and was so depressed that staying in bed and watching videos to ignore the stress was so much better. In fact someone at the school actually recommended homeschooling because the school average was in jeopardy. I'm intrested in art and im not bad by any means but thinking of doodling makes me feel like I'll fail and not improve or ever be successful. I've had friends back at school but only one has continued talking to me, probably once a month. I have an online friend who talks to me more but also has a job and other friends. My mother is always concerned with my sister or my youngest brother(the abusive one as mentioned before). My father is working in a physically demanding job and has a girlfriend who constantly complains of being ignored by him. I'm overweight and exercising doesn't faze (i believe is the correct word?) me but sweating and being judged weighs heavily on my mind. I am terrified of dying i just simply wish my parents stopped after my brothers. Im sure they wouldve been happier as well.Im unsure of what i except of this but here it is.

jgardner [info] I think teenagers would need to see a list of things and where they fall on the spectrum according to common understanding. With enough examples, they would know what to do in the various cases *and* remain perfectly tolerant. (I had someone say "I'm getting an abortion" when we were teenagers. That shook me to my core. I wish I had known at the time there were people who would've wanted to talk to me about that like my parents and my bishop.)As a professional, you can tell them what "signs of abuse" are and how to properly report, as well as what kinds of things are kept confidential with the bishop, etc...Another thing I might add while I have your attention: One thing that blew my mind as an EQP was having my mom (earned a degree in psychology) explain what the various common disorders are, what their signs are, and most especially, *what it is like living with these things.* Understanding what it meant when someone says, "I am clinically depressed" or "I have been diagnosed with anxiety" really awoke me to a better understanding of these issues and my patience, tolerance, kindness and charity towards people who deal with these things grew infinitely. I think teens need to know because that's when some of these things start presenting and I understand a very large number of people develop their illnesses in their twenties and their peers can be the most help of anyone.

jennyfromthebloccc [info] Things are falling into place for me for the first time in a while and I am so happy about it that I feel the need to share (lol) This is my first post on this sub - you are all so amazing!So here’s the deal, I’m a junior at an incredible university majoring in Human Resource Management - only problem is that I hate human resource management lol. Going into uni, I had no clue what I wanted to major in and HR seemed convincing and the fact that I am a people person made it seem like a decent fit. Over the last 2 years I have had 3 INCREDIBLE internships at very well known and large scale companies but I was absolutely miserable at all of them. I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was only 11 years old and after starting college, it got severe and led me down a very dark and depressing path. I cut myself off from my friends, family, peers, and just about anything fun. It was bad. I figured, let me just get my degree and figure it out maybe it’ll grow on me. Fast forward to this past summer and I got a very random opportunity through a family friend to intern at a Superior Court in a judges chambers. From the first day of this internship, I absolutely loved it and truly believe that I have found what I was meant to do. I always had an interest in law and the legal system but never knew where to get started. Now, my internship has been extended to the fall semester and the judge PERSONALLY said that he sees incredible potential in me as an attorney which means a lot coming from him (he’s a pretty big deal). Fast forward again to this afternoon where I used the money I made from this summer to buy very expensive but necessary books to start studying for the LSAT and have already begun research on law schools that are likely within my reach.  I have never been this happy and PROUD of myself. For some, this may seem silly of me and you may be thinking “well yeah - a lot of people find something they love and want to pursue”. I never thought this would happen for me. I was prepared to sit in an office for the rest of my life and become a robot. I am so excited for myself and this journey I am beginning. Much love!

IntrovertIdentity [info] I think what touch my nerve (although I didn’t post anything because today wasn’t my day for it) is that too often, I’ve been taught that “mental illness is simply unconfessed sin.”Too often, the solution to any mental health situation is more prayer or the likes and it neglects what is actually going on.Anxiety is more than just “everyday stress” or “DSM diagnosed psychological stress,” because it can be physiological as well. For example, my internist is my primary care physician. He once prescribed Paxil SR because I had anxiety. As a result, I see anxiety as a medical issue even though most folks see it as psychological.So, when there’s a post that reads “anxiety is contemplating your future without putting God in it” seems overly simplistic at best and dangerous at the worst.And while I was diagnosed with anxiety, I was an active church goer. So, then, what was the basis of my anxiety? Not contemplating God?If you’re trying to make a Successory poster like statement, what you said was fine. But, it really glosses over what anxiety actually is.And when we factor in the immanence and transcendence of God, our relationship with God when we are not feeling our best only gets more complicated.

yumcrackers [info] Questions in regards to possible emotional abuse... Hello, All.I'm a lurker here, as I have long suspected that my father possesses many of the traits that I've read about here, and today he has gone too far for me to keep quiet about.I will preface this by saying that I am a 35 year old female, with a 5 year old son. We do live in the same abode as my father, where I also help to care for my disabled mother (who has her own problems, though likely medicinally induced). I have been diagnosed with anxiety issues (likely due to experiencing emotional abuse and mild physical/non-sexual abuse growing up, as well as PTSD from a very stressful pregnancy).Today, my mother and I were packaging items to sell at my son's holiday bazaar at school, when my father became frustrated that he could not properly view the television. Apparently, the mere fact that my son was moving his body while playing with toys, exacerbated him to the point of physically threatening to "do something to" my son's hand. I happened to be behind him, and informed him, very concisely yet in a calm fashion (dunno' how) that he would not be threatening my son physically again, or that I would be calling the authorities.He then went on a rant, which I was recording on my phone. He belittled my anxiety problem, threatened our shelter, and threatened to turn break my personal property (telephone). Now, I do not pay rent, as my job is to care for my disabled mother while he is at work (whom he has literally left for dead twice on the couch in the last two years when I was not present- once it was septicemia, and the other time it was a sarcoid in her lungs). I have him recorded flipping me off, purposely using infantilism and other verbal methodry to exacerbate my anxiety. Upon threatening my shelter and informing me that I don't pay him enough money (while caring for my mother, working from home, caring for my son, caring for his animals, the home, and purchasing groceries and such that he eats), I handed him my large wallet, which he threw at my back, thus striking my upper right flank.I then proceeded to write everything down as an incident.I apologize for my format and wording, but this just all happened and I'm unsure of what to do. I don't have the means currently to leave (having spent money on Christmas for my son), I can't leave my mother here, and I can't take her with AND support her expensive medical care. In the past he has broken her arm, and neither her nor my brother (no contact with them now) did anything about it at the time, and I was living out of state (I was no contact with them at that time).I'm shaken up, beside myself, and am trying to maintain the emotional strength to keep it together in front of my child.I'm not sure what I'm looking for with this post. Advice, encouragement....I just don't know. I do know that I'm at the end of my rope, have a stomach-ache, and my hands are very shaky. Now he is sitting there acting like nothing happened. My mother, I think, is unable to react at this point. Ugh, guys. [info] ACoN, SG, fleas for days [info] 1481495076

Stormheartgirl [info] How Can I (22F) Get Better at Communicating with my BF (24m) I'm really bad at communicating when there's a problem in the relationship. I can't seem to talk about it at the time, and instead I bottle it up and dwell on it until something snaps and I either have a cry or we have an argument. I feel like my points are valid (I get annoyed at doing the majority of the housework, I don't like how he has a tendancy to snap at people when he's annoyed about something etc) but I just can't seem to express them in a healthy way. Part of it is that I don't have much experience of having to solve problems alongside a partner. My exes have mostly been very immature or clingy and the one time I got annoyed with my most recent ex (he made me miss a train home late at night because he was late) he just apologised and that was it. I should also note that I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back. I think most of it boils down to a bad breakup, one which came out of the blue for me, and a lot of my anxiety seems to hinge around worrying my partner might suddenly leave me, especially if we're having lots of problems. Tbf it is mostly the lack of good communication that seems to bother him. He does make changes when I point out problems, though that usually comes with a bit of frustration at me crying or getting needlessly angry. I have tried therapy before, but it doesn't seem to have helped me much. I'm also just plain confused at times. Sometimes I do take a while to bring up issues, but even when I think on them a while and try and bring them up in a non dramatic way, the hesitancy can cause confusion. Today, for example, I struggled to bring up a problem that has been an issue for a while, but became a bigger deal today. The problem was delicate and a little embarrassing to bring up (I trust him because he's my partner but it still felt a bit awkward) and although I did mention it several times today, my bf shrugged it off. I tried a third time to broach it casually, and while I was chewing over how to phrase the next sentence he changed the subject. And then realised when I went silent that the original conversation wasn't over. Not a big deal and totally accidental, but I'm now a bit confused because I did try and raise it in a non dramatic way, but because I didn't do it instantly at the time it didn't seem like I was trying to have a conversation about it. I feel like, even if I did get better at talking things out, I would still need some processing time. Any advice would be handy. I love this guy so much, and I really want to make this work, but I don't know how to bring up problems in a less dramatic way.Tl;dr I am terrible at communicating when there are problems in my relationship, owing to a lack of experience and anxiety. I bottle things up and then cry or end up arguing. My bf understands so far, but he does seem a bit exasperated that I can't find a less dramatic way of talking about things.

absurdlyastute [info] &gt; ... but dealing with antagonistic people is so commonplace that it doesn't trigger that kind of response.You said that you avoid social situations IRL though. If you get anxiety with your peers, I don't understand how you can avoid anxiety during times of duress--especially after you said you'd push past someone like me to avoid confrontation. I've been diagnosed with anxiety (who hasn't these days) and while what you said sounds good on paper, I don't believe you're being candid.    Why does it have to be something beyond curiosity? You create a theory about someone, and you attempt to validate it directly/indirectly. It does usually have a side effect in that if someone believes there is another person calling them out on lies, that they will think twice about lying. E.g. Someone similar to /u/mvincent17781 used to delete every single one of his comments that scored below 1 for two years. When I asked why, he stubbornly refuted deleting any of his comments. However, in the next week or so 50% of his commentary scored zero or below. I never bullied or upset the guy, but his behavior changed. If you can apply what you've learned to real life that would be an incredible tool to avoid conflict, scams, and unscrupulous sales people. On top of that you can improve others' days or your own. There are women at the grocery store I visit that call me their work son/bf. The guys at the meat counter don't know my name, but they give me free steaks from behind the counter or 50% discounts on their prepackaged meats. Is that not the least bit interesting?I'm not here to fight. I'm only answering the questions you're putting forward.  [info] None [info] 1520004927
PentaQQ [info] I feel like I'm a complete melt and am being cornered Hey guys! First time posting here. I don't really know how to structure long posts so it might get messy. Furthermore, I know I might sound EXTREMELY selfish in certain points but I'm just so burnt out I dont know anymore. And finally, sorry for the long post. There's a lot that I wanted to go through...I'm truly sorry for that :(.So a little background before I get into the my problem. A few years prior to the events I'm about to unfold, I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and have since been on medication from then till now. Fast forward a few years till 2018, I've been studying abroad since Feb 2018 in Canada (and I'm in Grade 11 so I'm not having those freshman problems I think) and during the semester from Feb till June, everything was going fine. I made some new friends, met a store clerk from the music store who was willing to teach me all about music production (which I was REALLY into it) and was I generally satisfied with how life was going. Then, I went back to my home country during the Summer.However, things started to go downhill after I came back from Summer. (to be honest my summer didn't go particularly well as I had several breakdowns and confrontations with my friends back in my home country but I want to solve my current issues first). The first issue I encountered was that I felt so different when I'm at school, as if I was an outsider to the school. It's just as if the school's atmosphere had took a 360 degree change. I don't know why but I just feel an external pressure pushing down on me for every step that I took within the school grounds. I just don't feel like myself anymore when I'm at school. The second issue I had was with the music instructor (the aforementioned clerk). He was a genuinely good teacher and tolerated me. However, when I tried to ask him when he will be available so we can have a lesson, he didn't respond. I know he had a busy schedule and stuff and I completely understand that. But he was constantly in game which had me questioning. Am I a nuisance to him? Does he want to stop teaching me? Theres still so much I wanted to learn about and this made me scared and unmotivated as I feel like I was left in the dark, trying to find the exit to this darkness with nothing but a dim of light.I'm just so burnt out at this point where normally everyday afterschool, I would be quite enthusiastic to talk with my friends in Canada and just make music in general but now, I'm just finding contents on Youtube to take some stress off my mind, wasting time. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like I'm myself at school anymore and I've started to fear what I once used to have a passion for. I'm just a complete melt and feel like I'm being cornered.Once again, sorry for the long and unorganized pile of text...I'm just so stressed and shit I don't know anymore...but big ups to whoever read the whole thing :) You are the MVPs.

JustLetMeGetAName [info] Dizziness and heart flutters for a few days now, do I need to go to the ER? So first off I am diagnosed with anxiety and I am normally on medication for it but I have been out for a few days now. So I dont know if this is related to that at all, but I've never had this happen before. So since Sunday night I have been feeling dizzy and having heart flutters when I'm up and moving. If I'm sitting or leaning against something I'm fine. It feels like waves washing over me every minute or so. I just took a shower and I've been sitting down for about 15 minutes now and it still hasn't gone away. I tried googling my symptoms and of course I'm extra paranoid now. I also didn't want to call the ER and ask because I know they take heart stuff very seriously. I also am a recreational weed user in a non legal state so I also didnt want to be dismissed due to that. It happens when I'm sober or not. Thank you to anyone who has advice!

dennismiller2024 [info] Urinated. Until yesterday.A little background, I'm 23 years old, and I was diagnosed with anxiety in high school. I have a small group of friends, but I like to stay in the same routine. I was talking to one of my friends about my daily routine, because we were having a deep conversation about both of our anxiety issues.He said, "Do you have OCD also? Sometimes I have to wash my hands for minutes after I pee before I feel clean." I had to tell him my biggest secret, someone that I've never told anyone. I said, "I've actually never peed before. I know it's something you're supposed to do, but I guess I just kinda never had the time." He was stunned by my revelation. "You've never peed before?!?!" Maybe it's because he had a fascination with urine or maybe it was just because I had never told him that before, but he was amazed that someone had not experience urinating. “You NEED to try it. In fact, let’s go to the bathroom. I’m going to teach you how to pee.”He walked me into the bathroom, and taught me how to lift up the toilet seat. He took my hand and arranged my fingers on the stem of my cock. “Relax, it’s easier than it looks. Here, watch me do it.” He pulled out his cock and started pissing into the toilet. “Just relax the muscles in your crotch, and focus on the sensations inside the penis. Whenever you feel a force coming outward of the penis, focus on it but don’t try to control it. If you feel it moving inward, then recognize it, and relax the muscles again until it’s moving outward.” I followed the instructions and nothing happened. I said, “I can’t help it. I feel the force. It’s moving back up. I’ll never pee, I should just give up.”“You got this, just relax. Don’t play mind games with yourself, you will pee before I let you leave this bathroom. If you don’t think you will pee, then no pee will come out. Trust me, you just have to believe in yourself.” I tried again, and pee started spraying out of my cock. "I'm doing it! I'm urinating!"I peed for 5 straight minutes. He said, "How do you like it?" I politiely asked him to leave the bathroom so I could be alone with my piss stream. I wiped the tip of my cock with a single square of toilet paper, and flushed. "I am a new man today," I thought. I ran over and hugged my friend in the most intense display of platonic affection I had ever experience. My pants were sprinkled with wet spots and urine continued to drip down my leg. My friend saw the urine marks on my pants, "Don't worry about that. You'll get the hang of it soon." We fell asleep together on the couch in his apartment. [info] None [info] 1553696566
cannabivore_9 [info] Start-up agency, sleepless nights, anxiety &amp; cannabis. Hi guys! I’m not here to promote the use of cannabis. I just wanna share experiences with anxiety that leads me to sleepless night, the state of mind and cannabis as a friend. I’m running a 2 mos. start-up brand marketing agency and I’m 23. My mentor decided to take the chance and build a start-up with me since anything that involves brands is always our passion.But running a start-up isn’t that easy. I had to find potential clients, build a service pitch deck and pitching to potential clients. Too much to think lately, until I reach to self-doubt and overthinking. I was diagnosed with anxiety 2 years ago and fighting it was a journey. These past few days, I realised that I think it’s coming back, I missed appetites, sleepless nights and sudden crying due to overthinking. I had open this up to my dad, thankful I have a good relationship with my dad, cause everything was so heavy.I had to take time, toke some, relax and think. Focus on what’s needed to be done.  Today, I’ll start doing self-medication and self-therapy with music, talks, and cannabis. And would be more open to my family and friends.Would love to document my journey here and let everything out, one step at a time. Thank you! [info] None [info] 1562129119
PostError [info] Marijuana induced anxiety... I've been smoking weed since about 16 or so. Now that I'm 18, I've been smoking for about a year straight now, never taking more than 2 days without having at least another joint. Yesterday, I got some kill Gorilla Glue from my bro (a strain I've had before) and  for some reason, this time smoking was a terrible experience. As soon as I put out my joint, I went to lay in my bed, and my heart started RACING. Like, 140 bpm kind of racing. I started to shake uncontrollably, I felt sick, cold. It was actually a pretty scary experience to say the least. Most of my friends are stoners and they have been for years, and I've never heard about anything like this happening to them. I have been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, but I'm no doctor, so I can't really tell what's going on. I woke my grandma up at 2am to drive me to the hospital. X-rays, blood tests, piss tests, all nothing. (At the time of going to the hospital, I didn't consider the fact that it may have been marijuana induced, so they said nothing to me about it.) After I went back home, I lit up the same joint and sure enough... Extreme anxiety. Guys, it's the next morning and I still feel this way. I'm kind of worried, I never want to even touch weed again. Will I be okay? [info] None [info] 1571771771
BennyBooper [info] WIBTA if I hung up my sisters phone Do to some recent circumstances me(14M), my 2 sisters (19F), my Mom, and my dogs have had to stay with my Oldest sister and her husband. I have only put the age of the aforementioned sister.So me and my sister have decided to stay in the same room while my other sister and my mom sleep in a different room. Because me and my sister both stay up late. But I didnt know that she kept her boyfriend on the call while she slept. They are in their early stages of a relationship where they do all the cutesy couple stuff and they stay up all night and the recent events have made them miss eachother, which is fine. But she leaves him on the call while she sleeps. I cant fall asleep because I can hear him awake on the call, he is continuing like this is normal but I get severe anxiety for certain things. I have been diagnosed with anxiety. And I cant fall asleep comfortably. Its 5 AM where I live and I dont feel comfortable with him on the phone. Even then I dont know her boyfriend that well. I've met him twice and they've been dating for about 8 months. So WIBTA for hanging up her phone? I'm planning on talking to her about it in the morning. I will post an update when I can.

Vivian42069 [info] Considering dropping Vyvanse (30 mg) I started Vyvanse 5 days ago, and so far the side effects have been pretty bad, but I quite like it as a drug for what it offers me. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, if that assists in anyone's understanding.It was going perfectly fine, other than my mouth being dry almost constantly, occasionally having issues 'getting it up' , and not being able to tell when I was hungry or thirsty, until day 4. On day 3, I had a very stressful day and experienced gag-inducing nausea. Long drive home, bickering with friends, getting into a very yell-intense argument, and then day 4 approached. On day 4, I felt like I was dying. I checked my heart, and my heart-rate had almost doubled, and my pulse had increased by about 40-50%. I sat in my desk-chair nearly the entire day, called out of work, and my heart-rate never went down.Today is day 5, and my heart-rate and pulse is still awful but not as bad, and as a result of my dry mouth one of my lip-piercings got infected.I'm getting very seriously tired of this drug, I want to continue it but it just gives me problem after problem, and it's starting to put my health on the line.Do these symptoms fade away in your cases? How long was it until most of the side effects (if any experienced) wore off? [info] None [info] 1545449119
SoftBluePetal [info] Rash on had for weeks 21, female, 168cm and 61kg. Only take contraceptive pills, smoke occasionally, no drug use, have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with anxiety I have a rash on my palm. that seems like it could be ring worm. It started as one dot and slowly got bigger. Now it's dry and redish on the inside with little spots in a C shape around it. But it doesn't look like the Google pictures, it's not really super red or anything.My scalp has also been quite itchy lately, and apparently that's a sign too. (it itched before I googled it so it's not made up) sometimes I can see some blood if I scratch my head a bit too much I tried putting clotrimazole 1% on it twice a day, morning and evening but it doesn't seem to help. As you can see, I am diagnosed with anxiety soo I'm scared I have some type of skin cancer. But I know some kind of infection is more likely.

SgtOceanus [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety. I feel like it's different from what I see on reddit and that.For me, everything is normal until either A. i remember something small, or B. Have something happen to be that seems super important.For A, I start panicking and worrying, going straight to the worst possible scenario. It's happened with leaving stuff by my computer, not remembering if I left my door open, or even which pen I took to school.For B, it's insane. I was working a double shift on Friday, and trying to hurry up so I didn't get left behind and make my boss (who is also my grandpa) mad. While adding whipped cream to a pie piece, I blew whipped cream out the back of the bag all over my apron. I was alright until I realized that I had tracked it on my shoe. Then I wanted to burst into tears and cry.B also makes it hard to fall asleep. I realize it's taking me longer to fall asleep. If I don't handle it quickly, I panic even more, and the cycle continues.Also intrusive thoughts but working out has helped so much with that. [info] None [info] 1497833252
ButReallyFolks [info] I feel you.  When I was in the process of the long road to my MS diagnosis, I was told upon arriving to the ER by the triage guy that I had anxiety. I didn't. But that night I was diagnosed with anxiety by the ER staff, as well. Brain fog and tingling arms and legs = anxiety.  Ever since then my doctors have labeled me with anxiety and major depressive disorder. I am circumstantially anxious - I strongly dislike doctors, and I have cried frequently at their offices because of how strongly I dislike visiting them and their disinterest in helping me. Apparently that makes me clinically anxious and depressed. Or I just want them to find out why I am having decreasing ability to breathe and immense lower back and hip pain. I was told it was anxiety and muscles. My MRI said a lot else. Go figure. [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1574393164
foxhill1996 [info] Inpatient care and OCD Hello, I’m a 22 year old female in the London area. I suffer from severe OCD and agoraphobia, with anxiety and regular panic attacks. I’ve had these issues for many years. I was diagnosed with anxiety and started on medication at 15 and later diagnosed with OCD at 17. I’ve gotten through rough patches and for a while I managed to function well. I’m entirely self dependant and have held down a job for two and a half years, taking medication and having therapy to deal with my issues. Yet the agoraphobia has come back and I’ve lost myself in a major way. I’ve been off sick from work for two months and I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m struggling beyond the point of self help. I’m looking for a reset. Something intensive before I really spiral back into suicidal tendencies. I have attempted before due to these issues a long time ago and I’m afraid that’s back around the corner. I have seen a treatment programme, inpatient for 16 weeks, CBT and occupational therapy included with full time support. It may seem extreme, given two months ago I was functioning fine, but I know how fast I can get worse. My job and my relationship are basically ruined due to this relapse. What are my options in the uk, primarily around London, for inpatient care? I can self fund as I have savings. Are there private options? Does anyone have any experiences with inpatient care in the area? I’m struggling to search around for myself. I’m overwhelmed and I keep short circuiting. [info] None [info] 1562300242

Lambeau_Analytica [info] Came here to say this. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ~~dissociation~~ derealization. I recall in my H.S. years being in a perpetual state of ~~dissociation~~ derealization for around 7 or 8 months. I'd wake up: *Am I cool? I'm cool. Wait, why would I ask that, I must not be cool, that's why I'm asking, 'cuz I'm still fucked aren't I, or maybe this is how reality used to be, or is it?, oh fuck oh fuck* BAM and it's like everything becomes a dream.        The best way I could describe it to my parents and doctors is, imagine looking at the world threw a backwards pair of binoculars. Everything seems so far away, you feel distant from everything in all directions. Even sensations like touch can take a second to register. You feel like a passenger in your own body. Familiar places look completely foreign.        For instance, I was having an episode so I walked around my apartment complex's parking lots. On my way back I had trouble finding my place because nothing looked familiar. It's the worst fear I've ever had in my life. It's literally a civil war inside your brain.          Lucky for me I figured out ways on how to never have this happen again. And it hasn't for about 10 years now? Now I can openly talk about all my experiences with it, but back then just hearing the word would instantly throw me back into the dream reality.         I could see where it'd be a fun experience if you're taking a drug. You know why it's happening and how long it'll last, but when it happens for reasons unknown to you, you lose all hope that you'll be able to live in that old reality again.

Shamrck99 [info] Coffee is for the corporate slave. I’ve just finished reading caffeine blues and decided to kick the habit I’m 2 days in with some mild headache, I had already cut down to 1 a day with maybe one more some of the days. I can feel my blood vessels opening as he describes in the book Caffeine restricts blood flow around the body the extremities and brain most effected.It has thought me that the science of caffeine is heavily flawed how most research is based on epidemiology and not on directly what caffeine does to the body on a mechanistic level (Your kidneys and shit) the research is sometimes old or flawed, they omit important factors, they study about coffee as if everyone is drinking out of 6oz cups and not eating chocolate or drinking coke. I did his calculations and found that I was consuming much more than what my fitness calculator and Starbucks had me believe.I always wondered how people my age could be so chill and I was always rushing around ready to kill someone for using a stapler wrong , it’s the caffeine which targets your adrenals to push out cortisol, push fat and sugar into the blood, restrict blood flow and engage the fight or flight response. The constant stimulation of your adrenals whilst also blocking adenosine causes your body to try and upregulate the adenosine receptors, this is why you get such potent withdrawal adenosine is responsible for sleep and blood vessel dilation so you just want to lay down and your head feels like a pounding erection.I thought I used to suffer with anxiety but I realised I was taking in more caffeine than Nestle , of course you are going to think your about to die when your throwing back this neurotoxic run run fluid, I remember I used to drink about 600mg+ of caffeine in school when I was diagnosed with anxiety I would walk around with those Starbucks “very very large posh Italian word used by an American company “ sized cups and I would sweat like I was after coming back from a run and wonder why so I went to the doctor and he tried to throw medicine at me so I spilled the coffee on him.Caffeine is a natural pesticide that is designed to overload the CNS of small insects and cause panic in smaller vertebrates. If you think it’s not dangerous caffeine can cause death in small dogs and cats just by one or two teabags alone and we slam back cups of it.Caffeine is one of the pillars of corporatism I believe, caffeine spikes you with enough buzz to be more productive but not enough to kill you and have you flopping on the floor like a fish that just got wired out of nemos backyard, in all seriousness caffeine blues talks about how we’ve all been brainwashed into thinking we **Need** our morning coffee or we can’t function. And it’s only to the benefit of 24 year old marketing graduates that we keep knocking it back.I realised also on a fitness level that my craving for chocolate was not an actual craving for it but a craving for the caffeine it contained  when I hadn’t had a cup in a while ( Don’t worry sugars my next enemy ) seeing as sugar consumption can predict violent crime https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/10/sugar-gateway-drug-violenceOn a health level you don’t have to be the professor of “health-ology at the institute for all things healthy and not bad” to understand that dumping fat and sugar into your blood **CHRONICALLY**can lead to diabetes and weight gain and that drinking fatty sugary frappa wappa cappas doesn’t help either.Coffee is one of the highest traded commodities in the world, the conditions for some bean farmers were terrible and some still are and it all goes to fuel our own insatiable craving to be a corporate drone maybe if I pound another 20oz and eat a whole bar of Columbian dark I can write more papers than that asshole mark, stop it. One of the most profound parts of the book was how it makes you lose most of your nutrition one of the basic core needs for existence, Magnesium, Calcium and potassium are all pushed out, B vitamins also that’s not good the “institute of all things healthy and not bad” would not approve.Stop reading counter articles talking about how caffeine is an antioxidant, stop talking about moderation is the best form of action and just get off it, wean off if if you want to avoid significant withdrawals, but just stop it https://miro.medium.com/max/324/1*HI4kj-TPAQrfQkAdrw2KTA.pngAnd check his book out.

boylognese [info] Depersonalization/Derealization Hi, friends. I was diagnosed with anxiety about 6-7 years ago. It’s gone largely untreated as it seemed to taper off a bit after high school and hasn’t been a huge hinderance since then. However, in the past month or so, I’ve been stricken with the worst anxiety I’ve experienced so far. On top of that, I’ve noticed symptoms of what I believe to be a manifesting depersonalization/derealization disorder. I feel entirely detached from myself, almost like I’m ghost walking on autopilot. I was driving home from work last night and I completely blacked out. I recognized that I was driving, that I was stopping at lights and making correct turns, but it was almost as if I had no conscious control over what I was doing. Probably the scariest experience I’ve ever had and definitely led to the worst panic attack of my life.I’ve been attempting to get in contact with my primary care doc for a referral so I can get on a medication/psychotherapy regiment, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips or stories regarding this or would potentially like to chat? Greatly appreciate any response! [info] None [info] 1556043792

CovertOpsCon [info] AITA for declining to go and see my girlfriend's extended family? I am on my winter break from work and have met and met up with many people (friends/family, including my gf's). I have not had a day where I spend time working on my own projects such as working on my music, reading on philosophy (a personal interest of mine) and working out. Today when I woke up I knew I had the whole day set aside for myself to do these things. At around 2:30pm today my girlfriend asked me if I could go see her extended family from out of town. Her parents are particularly notorious for making last minute plans, which my gf understands. So when asked I politely declined stating what was said above. She is now upset that I decided not to come. To be more specific, she called me an asshole with a raised voice and continued with her arguments:1) I have had the past week and a half to work on these things and I have chosen to "waste" it spending time with other people. I should have set aside time earlier.2) I am an asshole because I have the availability and I am refusing.I have spend lots of time with her over the past week and a half (I believe it has been 7-9 of the past 12 days) and the other days have been a mix of family and friends some from whom came from out of town. I would argue that the expectation of my attendance is rather rude and inconsiderate as the plans were made last minute. On another note, I have been diagnosed with anxiety (runs in the family).

EnoughDetective [info] Trouble sleeping (Im a guy, currently 19 years old.)For a long time I have had trouble falling asleep, everytime I am trying to fall asleep and there is a tiny noise in my room I have this sort of shock that goes through my body, it also causes me to see like static and it comes with a sound similar to being flashbanged in a video game.The sounds are all real and in my room like cracking of my wood floor etc. For as far as I know like from the age of 12 I have been having this, and It never really caused any trouble untill now. Because now I have a 29 hour a week job. And the thing is that I start to notice how fatigued I actually am, I always thought I was just lazy but the amount of energy this takes at night from being shocked every time I hear something it just drains me.On the sidenote, I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder (who not these days).And I've had some serious trauma's growing up as a kid, from being abused by my kindergarten teacher to being knocked out by a bully.&amp;#x200B;I haven't been to a real doctor yet, I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on my situation beforehand. Or diagnose me. [info] Patient [info] 1585571629
Dewdeaux [info] Interesting. I was diagnosed with anxiety in college (several years ago), but I never had panic attacks. It was more like insomnia and an inability to turn my mind off of intrusive thoughts. Are panic attacks triggered by underlying anxiety and stress, like delayed reactions? Because when these episodes happen, I’m not particularly worked up about anything.  [info] Son born 6/26/16; ? due 3/1/19 [info] 1544121740
alosar7 [info] Ok to clarify what the psychiatrist said after his evaluation: He is AWARE that I have been diagnosed with anxiety, but he does not think that what I am dealing with is related to it. I have no family history of mental illness or somatic disorders. The anxiety diagnosis was from around 12 years ago and I have been managing it since then. [info] This user has not yet been verified.

Squiddytick [info] I have anxiety medication that I'm meant to take every day, but I never take it, which caused me to eventually attempt suicide. Saw this sub on top growing communities and thought I'd share my story.So I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 12, I'm now 14, by my therapist which I am still going to now. I have medication for it. It started out as 25g of medication, which I took fine. When they started increasing the dosages is when I started to stop taking the medication. They brought up the dosage to 50g, I still took it fine. It was when they took it to 75g that I stopped taking it. You see, they didn't have a 75g pill. I had to eat 1 and 1/2 pills, which meant breaking the pills. I got lazy and just stopped taking it. I'd flush an estimated amount of pills down the toilet each week, and lie to my doctor and my therapist about how much I've been taking. Now, apparently suddenly getting off anxiety meds can cause some problems. It was about a month or 2 after I stopped taking said pills when I tried to commit suicide. I tried to slit my wrist, but thank god the object I was using was pretty dull, and not very sharp, because if it was a legitimate knife, I wouldn't be here right now. I started bleeding, but it was way too painful, so I realized what I was doing and stopped. The next time I went to the doctor to check up on my anxiety, I told them what happened, so they increased my dosage to 100g. They had a pill for 100g, which meant no more breaking pills, but since it was already out of my routine to take them, I haven't been taking them either. I'm still flushing the pills down the toilet and lying to my doctor and therapist. I'm not sure what might happen in the future as a result of this, but definitely not good. I'm trying to get back into the routine of taking them, but when I forget, I still have to flush them down the toilet, which is most of the time. My parents are getting on to me about not taking my pills because it seem like there's too many in the bottle (which there is), but I just act like they're crazy and I've been taking them daily.Just something to eat off my chest. I'm sorry if anyone was disturbed. [info] None [info] 1573439083
smokingpickles [info] It's strange to me how often it isn't characterized as that though and how often people think of anxiety disorders as intrusive thoughts when many people just have real life stressers that cause them to feel out of control and deal with it in other ways. I was diagnosed with anxiety but it turns out most of my anxiety is career related-I worry about not having a job or not having a job that is good enough. If I can convince myself that I am working toward somethings in my career, everything seems to fall away. Not entirely, but not in an insignificant way either. What you have going on sounds awful, I am happy to hear you have a therapist that is able to work with you and help you get to route of the problem. [info] None [info] 1536018390

I broke down crying there in front of the tribunal, but before I started crying, my head was swimming and I couldn’t figure out how to hold it upright. I felt like I was sitting sideways, and I couldn’t get back to normal. It was terrible. Maybe I was having an anxiety attack. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years later.

myknifeurlife [info] I would say mentally ill before I found emo, at least got really into emo. When I was young (age 10) I found bands that I felt were emo but was only somewhat into them.  As I got older I was diagnosed with anxiety and it wasn't until maybe 3 years later I found and fell in love with emo music.  From the age of 19 to now (23), I would say that emo music became a remedy for sure, or at least a great way to know that I wasn't alone in a lot of the feelings I had.  Now, I still love the music, and I honestly feel like it helped me learn a lot about myself and find out what (i hate using this word lol) triggers my anxiety.  Now, its pretty rare for me to get the same bad anxiety attacks I used to get, I still have my problems with my anxiety disorder but overall it has gotten a lot better and I honestly can say I feel like emo music had a lot to do with it.

DragonLordOfCookies [info] Is something clinging onto me? I get panic attacks. A LOT. I am diagnosed with anxiety and know the precautions and signs of them coming,but then theres... something else. A cold feeling runs down my spine. It digs metaphorical claws into me. I freeze. I sink. I sink into a vortex of everything I fear. Its out of the blue. Ill wake up and suddenly it shall consume my thoughts. Sometimes I feel a presence around,part of the room is covered in shadows more then usual,synchronicities stop when its around. I question everything I believe in,Nothing helps. I cant call for guidance,Family members cant calm me down, the only way to get rid of it is to fill my mind with something else. Ive talked to plenty of people before,even a psychiatrist and psychologist. None of them understand. No one seems to relate to the feeling... besides one person. They were a wiccan and suggested a cleansing with gems and candles (my only possessions at the time for any form of ridding myself of... it), and it was gone! For about a week. Thats all I ever get. A week here and there without it. Does anyone... have any clue what to do? Im usually a sane person who loves evidence but... all thats thrown out the window when I spiral.

thesilversound [info] I was recently diagnosed and almost all of the friends I’ve told were really surprised and didn’t believe it, which has been discouraging. To clarify: I have childhood trauma issues that intermingle with the ADHD, and so most of my friends were more so expecting me to tell them that I was diagnosed with anxiety or a trauma disorder (which I still think I have, on top of the ADHD). I am also in medical school and always did really well in high school and college (except for the higher level college classes that I couldn’t keep up with due to my inability to follow what the professor was saying or study for exams earlier than the day before the test). So everyone is skeptical that I have difficulty focusing on a daily basis.For the past month or so, I’ve been overcome by this compulsive urge to prove to myself that I actually do or don’t have ADHD, which has led me to spend hours and hours each night searching this subreddit, reading about ADHD, and talking about symptom-related memories and experiences to my friends and partner every single day. It’s been really exhausting and has been really draining for my partner as well, who is dealing with her own issues but always patiently listens to me spilling all of my stream of consciousness thoughts on to her.My dad also confronted me yesterday because he found out that I filled prescriptions for Adderall and Vyvanse. He gave me this lecture about how I should stop being angry and frustrated that I have trouble studying, because there’s no use to being angry, and that I should just accept that I might need to take more time than other people. He told me that everyone needs to just learn to live with their hardships in life and work with what they have. He said that he also is more disorganized than his coworkers and sleeps a lot (uh... yes, my whole family is like this, where does he think I get it from?) and that when I was younger, I always concentrated really well on drawing and reading (yes, because those were my favorite hobbies and I hyperfocused to the point that my mom banned me from reading fiction books up until I was 18) and that there’s nothing unusual about all that. And that he hopes that I don’t rely on the meds forever.So all in all, it’s been discouraging because for once in my life, I finally feel alert during the day and I finally have been able to sit down and do work without stressing about how I keep reading the same sentence over and over again. Tonight, I tried to watch a video for studying purposes after my meds wore off. I had forgotten what it was like to study before I was diagnosed. And I found that as soon as I sat down and clicked play, my brain immediately went into a sleepy trance and I was using all of my energy and willpower to redirect my attention, all while still missing stuff in between. I know that checking and rechecking your symptoms is not a healthy solution to doubting your diagnosis, but it’s what I’ve been turning to. All this to say, yes, the self doubt is a real struggle.

anothermanoutoftime [info] Hey buddy-Your story mirrors my own in many ways. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder a few years ago, but it really reared its head in the last 6 months or so as I coped with a great deal of work stress. I would get home, eat supper with my wife, and play Skyrim until bedtime. Usually past bedtime, because I didn't want to leave that world where I was a hero, or a villain, or maybe just a simple leek farmer, who happened to also be Archmage of the College of Winterhold. On the weekends I'd sometimes load the game up after breakfast and only stop for dinner. I know exactly what you mean about the roleplaying aspect- I'd construct a character in my head and really dive into it, and all the worry and stress would slide away. I wasn't me, I was a Nord warrior with a grudge against necromancers, or a Khajiit trying to find redemption for past crimes. But I'm also here to tell you that it gets better- I'm on a new med combo that finally seems to be working, although one of them makes me sweat like a damn pig, and life looks bright instead of terrifying for the first time in a long time. I'm glassing up a bit here, so I'll just say keep moving forward, that's all any of us can do. And PM me anytime you want. And death to the Stormcloaks! [info] PC [info] 1470462618

ThanosisKing [info] Employer will not listen to complaints, affecting my health I have had a job in the vision center of my local Wal-Mart for about 16 months now. Our old manager moved on in April of last year and we got a new manager in September of last year. Almost immediately he began creating rules and making schedules so that I'm working alone during peak hours. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and Asperger's and get panic attacks whenever things get real busy and I'm all by myself. All of this is documented by several doctors and has been turned into my employee file. I've tried pointing out what the manager is doing but my complaints are falling on deaf ears. Nobody is taking my health seriously. I complained to HR, to the store manager, to the market manager, but nothing is getting done. They are not listening to my complaints, which I think could fall under the ADA.Any info or help you could give me? Thanks. [info] None [info] 1525954846
To_a_Green_Thought [info] Thank you very much for posting this.I have a hard time going to the temple.  I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD, so I think that has something to do with it.  However, even before going to the temple got *really* hard for me (a few years ago), it was always tough.  It's a very stressful experience.  I mean, for crying out loud, I'm going to *God's house*.  That's pretty huge.  I think that, if more people really thought it through, more people would realize the magnitude of what they're doing (and, consequently, be stressed).  For many people, going to the temple is nothing more than going to the meetinghouse for church on Sunday....which is both bad and good.  On one hand, our church leaders have told us to contemplate the importance of the temple, to realize how special it is; based on their comments, it seems many members aren't doing that.  On the other hand, if our members get to the temple and do ordinances for their ancestors, whatever gets 'em there is good, I suppose.I'm rambling, I know.  The bottom line is this: I feel for you, because I feel the same way.  I may not have the exact same concerns as you, but it's hard for me, too.Let me share an experience I had in the temple that helped me.  This happened about a year ago, back when I was really making an effort to attend the temple more often.  (I have a toddler, which only adds to the difficulty of going, and I finally had a moment where I could get away.)  I chose to do initiatories, because it's better for me, I've found.  As I sat, waiting to start, I got a very strong impression that Heavenly Father wanted me in the temple, because it meant that I was closer to Him, and He simply wanted to be close to me.  I really felt how much He loved me.  Obviously, God can visit us whenever and wherever He wants to; I felt that He was telling me that it'd be easier for *me* to feel Him near in the temple.  It was a tender moment.I try to remember that.  It's still hard for me to attend the temple, but I try to remind myself that God just wants to be close to me, one of His children.  I reiterate this: *it's still very hard for me*.  I share this experience not to give you any sense of shame for not going, but simply to share what I've felt.  At the bottom of it all, God just wants to be closer to us, and that doesn't always mean doing an endowment session.  Just go (and, again, I'm telling myself this, as much as you) and be near God.

rgdenis [info] As expensive as a therapist is, go see one right now (assuming you have insurance at the moment) and get as much counseling as you can before you make the move.Talk to friends, and talk to people you trust. I have been diagnosed with anxiety almost two months ago and I'm finally doing A LOT better just by talking to my best friend for about an hour on the phone a day. It seems really tacky and obsessive but from my actions before the help, I don't know how far I could've made it before my thoughts made me lose all sanity. [info] None [info] 1437584825
easterbran [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety my sophomore year here. I've always made sure I have an outlet to keep me happy when school gets tough (hobbies). One pitfall I see a lot of GT students fall into is abusing alcohol to feel less-anxious. Be really careful with that stuff, I am still getting over my problem with it.Also, STAMPS psychiatry has been awesome for me. I worked with my doctor to increase the dosage (anti-anxiety meds) until it was worrying to me how little stress I felt about classes/assignments.

anonbff [info] I went to therapy. I learned that behavior can be a symptom of anxiety, which I didn’t know I had. Therapy taught me a lot more about myself. Like how to spot when it’s just me having a moment and what to do. After I was diagnosed with anxiety I went to my doctor and started taking Zoloft which was the best thing I’ve ever done. The change started at the root of the problem, the relationship. Though we loved each other very much, I knew I had no. There was no way for me to move on and grow from my old habits. I needed a clean slate. My next relationship was leaps and bounds better. We are both in a good place of mind, which makes our relationship all the better.  [info] None [info] 1550927391
Darksilverbuttons [info] I am struggling to get a diagnosis from my doctors and it is destroying my life. I am waiting on an Autism and an ADHD diagnoses for over a year after a psychotherapist wanted me to go get evaluated by my doctor after she told me to take online tests and print them out, I went to my doctor and got a referral but I am still waiting. My doctors are very useless and I am trying to be taken seriously as my doctors like to misdiagnose you with stuff, I have be complaining of all the stuff the psychotherapist told me was due to Autism and Adhd like sensory overload etc but my doctors keep telling me it's my anxiety. Ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety I thought I would finally feel understood but after it, I felt like there was something missing, I knew it wasn't a part of my personality like my delayed hearing, my sensory issues, being picky with food etc I am struggling in life because I don't have my diagnosis which is making life harder for me, I am not able to get help in college because I need proof of needing help which I can't get without my diagnosis, I have lost friends because I don't know what I did to offend them and I can't explain about autism and not understanding social cues if I have no evidence to back it up with, I have gone through fights with my boyfriend because of my withdrawing from him, because of my mood swings where I have been a complete mess because I am unable to understand more arguments and try to tell him I don't understand I will come across as manipulative which is complicating everything even more.I am at my wits ends because there is 1 thing that can solve all of this but because I am an adult female I am unlikely to get diagnosed because I am being misdiagnosed and having pills pushed on me by my doctors that have caused memory loss, mood swings, loss of appetite and worse of all have made me extremely tired and anxious. I stopped taking them after my hair fell out due to me stressing out so much, anything I complained about the tablets instead of checking me for something else they just upped the dose and changed the tablets I went from citalopram 20mg to sertraline 100mg in a matter of 2 months.How do I get my doctors to listen to me? I have no money for a private diagnosis. [info] None [info] 1577959728
mako-jaeger [info] Hmm, it's hard to say. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder in February, and I'm still trying to figure it out myself. I think you have to make peace with who you are and who you where in the past, and then take the proper steps to becoming the person you want to be.It of course won't be easy. In February after I went through the darkest period in my life, I realized a lot of things about myself. I think I had to just let go of all the bad things that had been holding me back, and embrace the good. For too long I was tied down by worrying about all the negative things people thought about me, and not appreciating the positives.I'm not sure if being "chill" is exactly the goal. I think being forgiving is a much more applicable goal. Being chill is good, but we will all have times of anger, uncertainty, and sadness. Trying to force those things out will only increase anxiety in my opinion. Instead forgive yourself if your anger, uncertainty, or sadness causes you to do something stupid. And investigate into why you are angry, uncertain, or sad.Also don't confuse eustress with distress. Putting it simply, eustress is what makes you feel like you have to get out of bed to fight the stressor, and distress is what makes you feel like your bed is your only safe haven from the stressor. Make sure your doing things out of eustress. Let it push you up. And accept that you will be stressed. It is hard for me a lot to accept that I am stressed. I don't always like it, and sometimes I want to ignore it. But the bright side is there is always a cause for stress, whether internal or external. Find the cause, investigate it, decide on how to act on it, confront the stressor, and move on.And as a final piece of advice to bring it all together, accept the bad days, because you'll have them. That's life. This semester has punched me in the gut so many times, I'm surprised I'm graduating in such a good shape. I think the key was accepting what happens, forgiving yourself and others, and moving on. Remember you can't change the past, but you can change the future. I live by this phrase in a lot of things: "Late, but not too late." Meaning essentially that sometimes you'll be late to a realization or doing something you should have done a long time ago, but it's not too late to make things the way you want them to be. And when it is (because it will be), accept it, forgive, and move on. [info] None [info] 1524878990
Tipper92 [info] 27 [M4F] North West, UK - I'm back, looking for someone special in my life ***SORRY THIS IS SO LONG. I SUCK AT WRITING SHORTHAND***&amp;#x200B;(Firstly, I know looks play a large part in someone's opinion, and while judgement terrifies me ahaha, I think it's only fair to share [what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/okuzyWj)! I don't take a lot of photos of myself, but folks say they like my dimples)&amp;#x200B;It's hard to know where to begin. I used to be quite active on reddit during a point where the option of a social life wasn't really open to me, and met a good pen pal. Unfortunately, I find myself in a similar position again, seeking something closer both in location and heart. While I'd like to be social and have someone close and special in my life, the few people I did have like that left some years ago. I'm here hoping I might find that again.&amp;#x200B;I live in the Manchester area. Currently studying film production at university and work part time retail on the side. I'm lucky enough to have my own place, but living by yourself without anyone to visit you gets quite isolating. I like to keep myself productive, creative, and open and ready for opportunities! I also have a large policy on being honest and open-hearted, so I guess I'll just open up as much as possible/necessary here and hope I don't scare everyone off!&amp;#x200B;**About me:**1. I'm 27, but I've been told I look much younger, which is why it's difficult getting attention from people my age - they think they'd be talking to a teenager or something! I act even older and am a middle-aged homemaker at heart. I wear wool cardigans, enjoy nights in, like doing crosswords, make homemade stews and soups, and while I'm not a neat freak, I like to keep quite tidy.2. I'm quite short for a guy - 5'4". Again, this doesn't help me look any less like a kid haha.3. I know it's a cliche, but I very much like animals, especially birds. I enjoy collecting RSPB bird pins. In a more stable, free position, I'd like to work more with animals.4. I used to be slightly overweight, but nearly two years ago decided to start looking after my mind and body a bit better, and now enjoy a healthy lifestyle. I've lost about 50lbs and hope to keep going. I don't completely deprive myself of the things I enjoy, as I think moderation is important.5. In total honest truth, I've never had a romantic relationship. This also means a date, a kiss or otherwise. I had a very close friendship with someone almost like a brother to me when I was younger, but the friendship ended messy and left me with a lot of anxieties and self-image issues. I know baggage turns people off, but I like to be 100% honest, and I think everyone has some form of baggage or experience-driven flaw. That's my big one.6. &amp;#x200B;**My Hobbies, in favourites order:**1. Daydreaming, honestly2. Video games (pretty much any platform, though I don't have a Switch), films and music3. Watching Youtube videos (Youtube &gt; Netflix &gt; Conventional television)4. Video editing (hoping to do it as a career)5. Writing (stories, scripts and song lyrics mostly)6. Hiking and nature, when I can get out of the city&amp;#x200B;I am, in the best case scenario, looking for a relationship, and I think it would be a good idea to share what good traits I have in that area, so you know if it's what you're looking for. I will also share my flaws, in case any of them are dealbreakers so that you're not wasting your time in messaging me.&amp;#x200B;**Good things about me:**1. Again, I consider myself an honest person who doesn't like lying.2. Without trying to sound too forceful, I fall into many of the cliches that girls say they like about guys (funny, committed, long walks on the beach kinda things). I've been told I'm funny and wanted to be a comedian growing up. I'm also write comedy. I like nature and the outdoors, and having someone to hike in the country with would be cool! I'm also paternally and monogamously-oriented, and while I don't want to rush anything, it's my dream to one day be a husband and father.3. I don't like doing things for myself as much as I like doing things for other people. When I had a close group of friends, I lived vicariously through them, and it makes me happy putting my focus into other people.4. I'd say I'm quite empathetic and prefer to listen and respond, rather than talk myself.5. I'm a moderate, objective person. I know what I'm good at, and what I'm not good at. I take criticism to heart, and if I mess up, I'll not only admit it, but need to be called out on it. It's how we grow.6. I suppose I could be considered quite a sensitive person, I'm in tune with my emotions and think its important to recognise all of them. I can be angry or miserable, at times, but I can also be energetic, relaxed, romantic, jokey, fiery, and more.7. Even though I am inexperienced, I consider myself quite an exploratory and vigorous person. I'm bi, and enjoy the idea of opening up to experiences in that area, should it ever happen. I say this to let people know that I'm not cloistered or physically broken or anything.Bad things about me:1. This is quite a biggy and I suppose I could have mentioned it earlier, but I was diagnosed with anxiety in my teens and it can flare up at random intervals, either lightly or heavily. As a result, I get easily nervous and if I ever do struggle to open up or voice concerns, it's not due to being egotistical and macho, I'm probably just really anxious about putting myself out there.2. This comes with a slew of other flawed traits; low confidence for example, which is why I'd prefer to talk about you or other people than myself. I can also jump between optimism, realism and pessimism quite regularly.3. Though sensitive to what people are saying, I'm quiet a lot of the time, and I say what I think is honest and necessary in as few words as possible. Although, I *think* that's mostly down to not really finding someone I have a passionate, connective engagement with for so long, and think if I found the right person, I would open up verbally a lot more.4. I'm a late bloomer in most respects; I can't drive, I've only recently been drunk for the first time (although I'm not opposed to a drink at all), and similarly just went out of the country for the first time too. Although travelling has always been a larger dream for me, my current situations never allowed it, as I've never been a rich man.5. Gonna reiterate it here, I'm 5'4". I know some may be thinking "that's not a negative, that's just your height", but I rarely, at least in the location I live in, see girls more attracted to guys shorter than them, and it's something I'm quite insecure about.6. I have an average frame, a little bit of muscle but also a little bit of pudge. I'm working to make it better, as I said I'm following a healthier lifestyle, but it takes some time to get there. I think self-betterment is important, and I don't think it's fair to ask for anyone who looks after themselves if I can't get to the same place myself.&amp;#x200B;**The kind of person I'm looking for:** I think everyone has preferences and I hope I don't come off sounding exclusionary and egotistical mentioning my own, aha. Though I am bi, I get on far better with girls, and pretty much just have female friends exclusively as testament to that. The main thing I like in people is kindness and sweetness. A nice smile and a soft voice are my weaknesses. I also like talking with people about various creative things, so if you're into anything artistic - if you're a photographer, musician, painter, fashion, streamer, anything - it'd be something we could definitely talk about. Same with healthy living, if you're into exercise and home cooking, it would be great to share tips and help encourage each other!  I prefer girls my age, or younger, so between the ages of 20-27 would be preferable. Physically, my type is petite girls. Not necessarily fit, but I do go for shorter, smaller girls. This isn't a dealbreaker for me at all, so don't worry if you're not short or have body fat - I would be a hypocrite otherwise! If you're shy, or homely, or sensitive, and want to open up to someone more, then I think we would be in very similar positions and get on well. I don't smoke or drink much myself, but I'm 420-friendly and don't mind getting tipsy, if that's your thing!&amp;#x200B;**What I'm after:** In an *absolute ideal* world, I'm looking for someone who would be interested in getting to know each other, become close, and hopefully if we hit it off, have it develop into something more. If not romantic, then the minimum I'm looking for is to open up to someone together. Someone who would like a person in their life they can have a strong, honest connection with - that person that you chat with nearly every day and don't feel weird about sharing all your frustrations and emotions with. I do miss having a best friend, and I would like that again.If you live in the North West area and are in a similar boat, or I sound like someone you'd like to know, then please message me! And, as I said at the beginning, I'm sorry this post was so long. Still holding out to rediscover someone who will be very important to me.&amp;#x200B;(I do want to make a point to say, you don't have to be an overtly confident speaker, but as you can see, in an effort to carry on a conversation, I write quite detailed. I ask for more than one line replies, a desire to actually engage in topics, and don't be afraid to ask questions in your messaging and replies. I always reply to really cool-sounding people on here, who have written large open-hearted posts, but then when we get into messaging they write one line about the weather and don't help me to share or connect with them at all.)

sookisucks [info] Yea I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I saw a therapist for about 9 months and sometimes feel I should find a new one in this state. I just simply decided to own it. Some shit really messes with me. I was once driving about 4.5 hours with just one of my gfs friends. I knew her but wasn’t all that close. Night driving in the highway really fucks with me so I just told her up front what was going on. I’m not shy about saying that issue because it really helps and most people will understand.

skimask7 [info] I first did acid when I was 15, and I will tell you that although for the first 2 years I had no regrets, once I actually grew up I regretted everything.  Not so much actual regret, but I just know that my mind was not ready to make proper sense out of all of my experiences.Just like I did, she's probably doing it because it's hype.  I honestly would have shamed her and the people giving it to her, because we all know "hey drugs are bad" doesn't work.  The ONLY thing that has worked for me to stay out of certain drugs as a teenager was being socially shamed for it, then again, idk what works for other people.  And by shame, I don't mean talk to them like a coach, I mean going "lol that's gay asf bro".  Once you grow up, you don't care what people think.  When you're a teenager however, 75% of your motives are to impress other people.  I wouldn't be surprised if she took it because everyone hyped her up.  "AYY THE LIL 14 YEAR OLD WANTS A TAB HOW COOL IS THAT SHE CRAZYYY".Now I'm diagnosed with anxiety and I know that tripping played a part in the equation bc the root of all of my anxiety is my impending death, something I didn't care about before tripping.14 year olds should NOT be trippingEdit:  also, no diss towards you, but your friends are weird for hanging around teenagers when they're 23, let alone a 14 year old girl.  Not jumping to conclusions but are you sure they're not one of those people that hangs out with highschool girls when they're in their 20's?  Weird, possibly rapey.  I'd re-evaluate who your friends are, and who you take drugs around.  Again, I'm probably jumping to major conclusions here based off of the people I've met, but be careful regardless.

Tinabird20 [info] When Doctors Suck. Warning I'm going to talk about some topics specific to those of us who menstruate. If you don't want to read about that don't read this post.  I saw another post about a bad doctor and switching your primary care physician. So I thought I'd share my story as well.   When I was 14 years old my saint of a Primary Care Doctor switched to strictly pediatrics. So my Mom chose a new doctor.  Well being a young girl I didn't know that the things that happened weren't acceptable, or that I had a choice to switch doctors. Here is the list of things that finally at 23 made me kick this particular doctor to the curb.  1. I was on the boys wrestling team in high school. When I went to the doctor to complain of knee pain. He scolded me for "being silly enough to be in a boys sport" and that "girls aren't meant for that kind of physical activity."   2. When my periods were so heavy I couldn't go to class without having to change my tampon every hour he put me on birthcontol. The pill lessened the heaviness but prolonged my period to 15 days. When I complained he shrugged and said he already put my on the pill there was nothing else to do. I didn't know until college I could just change types of birthcontol.    3. I was diagnosed with anxiety and after that any and all ailments were chalked up to me being anxious and dismissed.    4. Had an untreated sinus infection I went in for three times. Each time I was told I just had a cold go home. This weakened my immune system and made me miserable for a month or longer. When I went to the emergency room because of a bladder and ear infection I was told I had a sinus infection. Three days of antibiotics later I was perfectly fine.   Basically moral of the story we are the customers of doctors and we should listen to their advice. But, if your doctor is dismissing your concerns get a new one. [info] None [info] 1556304573
DarthDadaD20 [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I know it's hard. The whole week up to playing I think if excuses to not play, I get angry and say "why do I even fucking play games".I do the same with other competitive games too. I'll drive to go play Pokemon or miniatures or magic and half way there turn the car around and go home.....make up an excuse to tell my wife why I didn't go.But here are a few things I hope helps you.There are "lfg" (looking for group) pages here on Reddit and other social media. post can help you find games in your area.there are also websites like meetup.com. my small town has a huge meet up page for Dungeons and Dragonsif you're ever at a store and see somebody pick up Lord the rings or Star Wars, magic cards or something else nerdy....they might know of or be interested in the game.As for actually playing, know that many, many players actually suffer with anxiety or other mental disabilities, or even just socially awkward so if you find a group you might not be alone.And I'll tell you. At first I hate myself and just want to go home, but while playing, after getting into it I really do forget all about it and have the most fun, then I feel good the next few days (and then unfortunately the whole cycle starts again) [info] DM [info] 1450397028
hrhashley [info] Thank you for posting - as you mentioned, I have been diagnosed with anxiety issues (hence the sertraline). I've definitely had anxiety/panic episodes before in the past that have stemmed from a health standpoint, but I've been taking my medication regularly and I don't necessarily feel like I'm having a long-winded anxiety episode, though I'm sure that could be a part of it. I've just never had chest discomfort and bouts of shortness of breath last this long since before my last heart surgery.I guess my biggest concern is that I've read one too many things on the internet about how people, especially women, go in and all of their tests look perfectly fine so they're sent home and then 2 weeks later they're having a full on heart attack, which again, I know sounds like anxiety, but it's more of me wondering 'what's the likelihood that this could actually happen' question.

Romainvicta476 [info] An interesting interaction For a little background, I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and I'm also high functioning autistic. Grew up in an offshoot of an offshoot of Mormonism. Anyway, my faith crisis is finally nearing it's end with me comfortably finding a home in atheism. I have a friend. This friend is rather special to me. She understands me so much better than anyone else. I'm able to be open with my anxiety and autism with her. She's the same way with me, able to be open about her experiences. It's not my place to share more details than that. As part of my faith crisis, I started to join the Catholic church. The historian in me loved it. But, last night I had a thought I never had. "What does normal look like for me?" I'd asked many times "how can I ever have a normal life?" But I asked that different question last night and it changed how I looked at things. I have an incredible opportunity to define what normal is for me, from the bottom up. And the first step in creating that is to leave religion behind entirely. I told all this to my friend, who is Catholic, and explained my reasoning. I told her the big points of my faith crisis and what drove me away from Christianity (shared experiences of emotional rises when witnessing moral behavior, all too uncanny similarities between Jesus and the other man-made gods, and god being more akin to an abuser than an all loving deity). I told her all of this and she responds right away with "Well what if god gave you those things to impact and change the lives of others?" I went right back to saying that was more like an abuser than a loving deity. I went into more detail about how my upbringing with religion stole away so much of my life and prevented me from even thinking about professional psychiatric help when I needed it when I was a kid.  We've hit a lull because she's at work, but of all the people. I thought she would at least understand why. I never expected her to like that change, she was very supportive of me in joining the Catholic church, but at least be understanding. Just an interesting interaction today.

PhysAnx92 [info] How do I remove attention from my heart beat?

4dham [info] As I am sure you are aware, ADHD is often comborbid.I was diagnosed with anxiety alongside my ADHD and to be honest, it's gone away with medication. I think therefore that anxiety was probably just a coping mechanism I developed for dealing with the aspects of ADHD that I found most difficult - it's difficult to deal with racing thoughts all of the time, so mild anxiety helped me to anchor my thoughts on a single (but usually negative) thing that might happen because of my ADHD e.g. running late, might blurt out the wrong thing in a social situation, might find it hard to sit still etc.It sounds very similar to this?&amp;#x200B; [info] ADHD-C [info] 1541837633

invaderpixel [info] I've been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, not taking or doing anything for it at the moment, the BIGGEST thing you have to watch out for is everyone else. A wedding is the ultimate small talk for most people, even though for you it's deeply personal. I had a ton of random acquaintances who found out I was planning a wedding in 7 and a half months tell me "WOW THAT'S REALLY FAST!" and go on and on about it, to the point where I was convinced I had something seriously wrong with my wedding and everything would be a disaster. (I actually even had my dress and venue, catering and drinks taken care of before I was officially engaged with a ring on me because my FH was saving up for one) I think anxiety made me freak out more about people's reactions to how short my engagement was, when really my engagement length wasn't THAT short or unheard of. The thing that helped me the most was making quick decisions after basic research and then reciting all the things I've done so far. "I already have my dress, venue, catering, invitations, cupcake tower, cake topper, shoes, undergarments, dj, photographer, flowers, etc." Little random things will pop up (absolutely need a musician to play at the church? Ok I guess) but I will handle them after reciting all the big things I have done already.  [info]  [info] 1370648039

Thought I was having an asthma attack and would get frustrated when my inhaler didn't help.

Jynxbunni [info] I need some help So, I was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago. I've never read my own records, but if memory serves me correctly, it was social anxiety. I believe this has definitely morphed into a more general issue, especially over the last few years. It's only occasionally been an issue, until more recently.I started nursing school about two weeks ago. It's been, okay really, so far. I've already been a CNA at a hospital for a few years, so I definitely have a step up on my peers. I keep organized well enough, but I always feel like I am forgetting something that is due. If I don't write something in my calendar right away, it will definitely be forgotten about. The homework load is okay, I actually got all of this week's work done by Tuesday.But..something has changed. I can feel it, and I know my fiancee has noticed it as well. I can't pay attention in class. I have to be doing something else at the same time. I can't just be listening and taking notes, I have to also be playing a game or surfing reddit. This is what I did for all of my pre-reqs, and I passed with A's, so I am not too worried quite yet, however this continues at home as well. I feel like I can't relax, no matter where I am. For the last few days, I have had this constant pit in my stomach, that never seems to go away, no matter what. I feel so unfocused and out of control. I've been more easily irritated with my fiance (who's major show of affection is annoyance), and I know he knows it. I can't sit still, when I do I feel like there are so many other things I can be doing, but when I actually have time to do them, I don't. We're also getting married in October, but something needs to change before then.I'm not on any meds right now, though I'm not terribly opposed. I try to relieve stress through games and riding my bike. I don't know what to do, and this isn't working, and I feel like I'm losing it. What do? [info] None [info] 1441380766

booksblanketsandtea [info] Every year when I was a kid my family and my god parents and their kids would go on holiday together. We usually went up to Nelson or Picton area (top of the South Island, NZ) and stayed at this holiday home we rented for a few years running. This one year (which was to be our last year at this home we rented) we ended up going to a beach a few bays around from where we were staying. I must have been about nine or ten at the time. Anyway, so we get to this beach and I have to say, it was the worst fucking place we could have chosen. The car was up a hill and you had to walk down a track in the bush to get to the beach. The beach itself was right against the flowering native plant life, so there were wasps fucking Everywhere - and I'm terrified of the little wankers (I like bees, though am still scared of them). Normally this would be fine, I'd just go swimming and wouldn't be bothered by them - but nope. Jellyfish. Jellyfish everywhere. So, I'm sitting on the beach hunched up trying not to cry from fear - my Mum and Dad think I'm being a whiney little brat and are ignoring me. My sister, brother and god-sisters are all frolicking around having a great time. I am Miserable and on the verge of a panic attack (I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago and this is the earliest panic attack I can remember having) - so I try and do what anyone would do in that situation: I try to get out. I tell Mum that I want to go sit in the car (not wanting to ruin everyone else's fun). She says no. Every few minutes I ask when we're leaving, flinching as bees and wasps fly around me, keeping a good distance from the ocean and the blue bottles swimming there.Eventually a wasp gets caught in my (then, waist length) hair and I decide 'fuck it, I'm not dealing with this shit anymore' - so I just get up and walk up to the car on my own. It's locked of course, but the window is open so i spend the next few minutes with arm in the car trying to unlock it- and suddenly I hear a noise and turn to see my Mum stalking towards me. This was my 'oh shit' moment. Never in my life have I been more scared - the jellyfish, the wasps and now my own mother is bearing down on me with a look on her face that says she is ready to Kill. She grabs me by the arm (still in the window) and drags me away from the car and starts giving me a hiding - I've already been crying from the fear and because no one had taken me seriously when I expressed that fear (which was honestly probably the worst part about it all) - now I'm crying because Mums giving me a few good wacks round the arse for (in my mind) simply being scared. I was grounded like you wouldn't believe - had to stay in my room, wasn't allowed to see my friend (the daughter of the people we rented the holiday home from) and we only ever saw each other once a year - and as I said, this was our last year renting that place. I wasn't allowed to play my gameboy or even read my books. I basically stayed in bed for the last four days of our trip and had to think about what I had done. It still makes me furious and scared to this day - I still have the odd nightmare of feeling trapped on a beach. I never really told my parents that I was worried or scared again after that, because it just felt like they didn't care.  [info] None [info] 1417138845
AlphaCentauri94 [info] Got this letter edited on an online editing service. Just wanna get your opinion whether they have done a good job? So I got this letter edited by a person who claims to be a professional copy editor and proofreaders working for an online editing website. Please keep in mind that english is my third language and I am not so good in my writing skills. So I really cannot give a proper remark on this letter. And this is why I will need your help.   But if you ask me, I'd say the grammar looks fine to me but I dont know why but there is something in it that looks odd lol.  The letter is huge, so I only posted the first half of it.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B; =======================================================================================Dear Sir or Madam,I am writing this letter to explain the purpose of my visit to Canada. But before doing that, I would like to give some background information regarding my previous stay in Canada. In the year 2014, I began my undergraduate studies as an international student at University of Guelph in the bachelor of arts and science program in Guelph, Ontario. Around the second semester of my studies, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and because of this, I started having extreme difficulties coping with my school work. With the help of medication prescribed by the university physician, I managed to complete my fourth semester (second year). Unfortunately, by the time I was in my third year, my anxiety symptoms started to worsen. And as a result, I decided to withdraw from University of Guelph. As I was still receiving treatment from my physician, I decided to stay in Canada for 4 months after withdrawing from the last semester of university, then I left Canada and only I returned once in December 2018 for a short visit before the expiration of my study permit.My condition has improved significantly since the time I withdrew from my studies, and I belive I will be able to resume my studies sometime in future, maybe in few months. Now since I don’t know how long will it take for me to fully feel mentally healthy to go back to school, I am deciding to apply for just a visit visa for now. I have stated below the reasons for the urgency for my visit to Canada.During my upcoming visit, which I am planning to set for two weeks, I will be collecting some documents from the university (e.g., a letter from my professor, my transcripts, etc.). And though I have not yet booked an appointment with my doctor, I will be visiting her clinic to request some documents and a reevaluation of my medical condition. While in Canada, I also plan to visit my bank, CIBC, to make a few changes to my account (as I still have an active Canadian bank account). I am slowly gaining interest in pursuing business education, and I plan to visit some universities with reputable business programs while I am in Canada. As for the rest of the available time, I plan to tour around the city. I have attached the documents and the daily agenda that I have created for my stay. The attached documents include: 1. my hotel reservation for two weeks, 2. my tentative flight plan (I have not yet purchased the tickets. If my visa is approved, I will make the final payment at that time), 3. my daily agenda, 4. a letter from my university physician, and 5. my personal bank statements for the past six months.

Read a book if you can or watch your favorite comforting TV show. Snuggle in bed. Don’t force yourself to meditate or breathe a certain way if it doesn’t work for you.It will pass.

rc1025 [info] My first pregnancy was a 20 week loss, my second was successful, and I am here again now. All the worrying in the world could not prepare me for the pain of that late loss, it was so useless. Worry is such a useless exercise. I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD after that, and my next pregnancy I was on zoloft a bit and had appointments every two weeks, mostly to manage my anxiety. I would talk to your doctor about your levels of anxiety. Tell her it is impeding on your day-to-day life. When it gets to that point, I think something needs to be done. Also, if you are anxious, get off these boards. Stop reading about incompetent cervixes and PPROM and stuff. I wish I had taken that advice myself. I'm doing better this pregnancy so far- the other day I was reading about something horrible (like you are doing) and freaking out and then was able to tell myself "stop it. stop worrying about this rare, unlikely thing. you'll deal with it if it happens". And then I just...stopped. It was a huge moment for me, brought on by therapy, drugs, and doctor's help. You will deal with it if it happens. Until then, you are okay.

Jenny-Thalia [info] I'm a bit late to this but... When I was younger, I was in blatantly abusive relationships. I mean, I knew they were. Sexual and physical abuse are obvious aren't they? Then I got help and got much better mentally and emotionally and had healthy relationships. Then he came along. This one was so much harder to see what he was doing. He was amazing for three years. In year four, things got weird. I found some suspicious texts (truly by accident, they popped up on his screen, I never ever checked his phone). It spiralled. He spent months telling me to stop seeking reassurance about us, while simultaneously cancelling our plans on the regular and just being straight up cold towards me. He stopped bringing me out but always had excuses like he was too tired. He stopped letting me see his friends or family, again "too tired," or "I don't see them much anymore." He'd drop out of contact for a night, telling me a relative was sick or his mom was needing help. He all of a sudden never had money anymore so I'd "lend" him money that he'd feel so so guilty about. But never paid me back. He never bought me a birthday present (not even  a card, I'd  be happy  with a card) and I had to pay for him to come for dinner for my birthday because he had "no money." The worst part was I'm diagnosed with anxiety and was always so honest about that. So anytime I questioned how things were, how he was treating me, if he was cheating, he'd tell me my anxiety was making me paranoid and to stop being crazy. It got so bad that I spoke to my doctor about going back on meds and to therapy. She actually told me I didn't need either but that therapy might help me because I was somehow perfectly happy and healthy in every other relationship or friendship in life. Guess she knew what was up. Turns out he was cheating. Even when I saw the proof, I was crazy and he loved me and I need to stop being so anxious. The effect being mentally abused has had on me has been profound. It was so slow, so sly and so unlike what I'd experienced before. It's only been a couple of months but I'm a different person. I don't even speak to male friends now, fearing ulterior motives. I hide all of my feelings and don't share my emotions with anyone in case they're ever used against me again. I'm very quiet and reserved now and keep to myself. Before I was bubbly and fun to be around. And it fucking sucks because despite what he did, I love him and although I'd never ever take him back, I can't just write off those three years where he treated me like royalty. And now I'm stuck wondering was it all a lie?  I thought I was stronger than this. And he doesn't care.  [info] None [info] 1542909810
LilPad93 [info] Thank you very much.  Although I fear that I am BPD a lot, I know that being aware and actively fighting my issues is something to be relieved about in that aspect.  I don't deny nor hide the fact that I  have issues. When I can afford therapy, I most certainly am going. I want to try it, and I want to try to get this burden off of me.   I read articles, I and I buy self help books, I've read a few, and I tend to get too analytical of myself, so maybe my husband needs to read them with me.  I know some people in our situations tend to be a little off in relationships.  My relationship with my husband comforts me in that I am normal with him, and he tells me that I overthink how I act too much.  (I have been diagnosed with anxiety.) Thank you again.

reallyokfinewhatever [info] &gt; How can you tell if your struggles are due to an actual issue, or due to finally hitting a "challenging" level of work that is actually hard for you?In grade school up to 6th grade, school was shockingly easy for me. Laughably easy. I was told I was a bright kid. I was told I was naturally good at everything--sports, music, math, writing.In 7th grade I got my first A instead of an A+ (*shock!horror*). And I wondered if I wasn't smart anymore. In 8th grade I got my first B+ and I honestly thought I was completely failing, or had contracted a terminal brain diseases or something.In high school, I realized kids did this thing called "studying" and I didn't get how staring at a textbook made you smarter. My strategy was always to get really stressed out the day before a test and just wing it. I thought, if I didn't just know it then I must be inherently stupid and bad at learning.I spent SO much time trying to figure out how to study. I could stare at a textbook taking notes for hours and retain nothing. Meanwhile, I also found that turning my studying into games--like simultaneously teaching myself PHP in order to code myself a practice test for history class--made my information retention skyrocket.As I continued to go up in grade levels, college, etc. I came to find that I actually had NO sense of discipline, motivation, or focus. My entire four years in college were spent agonizing over how much I could not focus, feeling like a failure, and missing deadlines.I wished desperately for the years when I was little that everything just made sense to me because I thought that was how I was SUPPOSED to be--just inherently knowing everything without trying. When I had to truly focus and work hard to learn, I found my thoughts were actually completely scattered this whole time, and it made me increasingly agitated and incapable of functioning.For a long time I was diagnosed with anxiety (which, to be fair, I totally had/have). Like the typical high-functioning kid/young adult I was, every time I said something that revealed my low self-esteem, I was tagged as the typical perfectionist pretty girl with anxiety and an eating disorder. No one ever suspected ADHD until I did, and it wasn't until AFTER college when my symptoms finally became so extremely obvious, completely outside of an academic setting.All this to say maybe think about the non-academic symptoms you might be having--it became laughably obvious to me that ADHD was the driving factor my whole life once I came to identify all the symptoms I had that were not aggravated by school.

Horny_Hipst3r [info] As far as my experience with leading groups comes from, I've been involved as the main organizer of some smaller\-scale political demonstrations. Also I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and keep having panic attacks time to time. I would like to say that being in any leadership position, you are not doing the most work, but you can delegate and rely on others to do it for you, while you just have to be sure how what they are doing  fits into the bigger picture, and sometimes you are expected to speak on their behalf when you are representing your group \(in your case, I'd imagine it would be you who'd end up writing articles about your club's activities to the student paper/blog/social media etc.\). Good way to negate your anxiety is to get to know people who you're about to get involved with \(other club members etc.\) \- try to find time to talk to them a little in person, such as joking around, making small talk etc. getting comfortable so you'll feel less anxious about your situation, and feel their support. Saying this because it absolutely sucks when you can't trust people you're working with, only adds to the stress and anxiety. You say you are passionate about french language and the minor you're studying, I think that's about all that you need right now. Remember, it's a student club at a university, you are not some high\-level executive at a corporation, so you are more expected to be enthusiastic and reasonably proactive, not to crunch numbers or fuss over business management models. Don't worry, you'll do an amazing job :\) [info] GAD/Panic Disorder [info] 1525759943
Daniel-Tigers-Dad [info] I’m going to take a crack at answering this; not because our situations are necessarily analogous, but because my anxiety and self-doubt are on such an extreme side of the scale and TRT has helped in some ways.I am diagnosed with anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which itself is an extreme anxiety disorder. I got on TRT while recovering from a significant mental breakdown which lead to my OCD diagnosis and subsequent treatment.  They call OCD the doubters disorder because it manifests in extreme self-doubt making you question whether anything and everything you do is the right move. I had always been able to manage my OCD until my 30s when due to a variety of possibilities my T levels tanked and after some research I found there are correlations in studies between low T and OCD. Once I got tested my dr put me on T Cypionate and I have had mixed results; likely due to estrogen spikes.To answer your question my anxiety is less, but not inherently. I have the same amount of stress and anxiety, but what changed is my ability to say, “Fuck it. This is hard, but I have what it takes to push through and make shit work.” I was always able to do that before my T levels tanked and all the sudden I felt myself paralyzed and feeling like a victim instead of a warrior going to battle. Stressors come, but I kick into gear, refocus and go to war with life. Additionally I have found myself not doubting my training and knowledge which has helped me make quick, correct decisions at work. I have also found myself standing up to people more when appropriate as where before I would have stayed quiet. Not picking fights, but standing up for ideas that are important.Sorry for the novel of a response, but I felt the back story would make the explanation make more sense, especially having gone from normal T to low and back to normal.

Yer1blackfriend [info] I love my mom and I think that undiagnosed and untreated general anxiety disorder made her this way, but she’s incredibly negative. Every time I wanted to try something new as a kid or take up a new hobby, she’d always mention how it could go wrong/wouldn’t work. Want to try out for soccer? “Who will pick you up from practice?” Want to take up acting/drama? “You know that’s not a stable profession.” (I was like 10 btw). Want to try cheerleading? “You sure you can do all of those tricks?” Playing in a concert for your middle school band? “Ugh, now I have to sit during that long concert.” I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago and now have to check myself from being a negative Nancy all of the time that often makes me insecure about taking up something new. For instance, I love comedy and have really wanted to take up improv for the longest time but it takes a lot to move past the negative thoughts and just go for things. I know that when I have kids, I want to make sure that I always encourage them to go for their passions and at least try new and different things.  [info] None [info] 1528490369

AlexandriaVineyard [info] Is this anxiety? Or insomnia? Any advice appreciated! 24F5’675kgCaucasianU.KNo existing medical issues Nexplanon Implant (contraception)Used to be a casual drinker (~2x/mo), doing Stoptober with my family No recreational drug use So for the past few weeks I’ve been REALLY struggling to sleep - not managing to sleep until 3/4/5am, waking every hour or less, and, although throughout the day I feel it, but ignore it, when I get into bed I can feel this almost adrenaline feeling in my arms and legs along with a tight knot of worry in my tummy, and although I feel it during the day, it’s harder to ignore when I’m trying to block out everything to get to bed. The adrenaline feeling makes it impossible to sleep for ages because I feel like I need to get up and go for a run, or hit something, to try and use this energy up. Some nights when I get my head into a vicious circle of thinking, I can become a little short of breath and have to ‘talk myself down’. My mother and my sister have both experienced panic attacks in the past, but up until now, I was lucky in that I’ve never experienced this - I always used to think of myself as happy go lucky person; positive, nothing could hurt me - so I’m not sure if what I’m feeling IS anxiety.I always used to be able to use ‘thinking through situations’ to help myself feel better. But now, I can’t stop it when it reaches its ‘end point’. I panic, and go through every situation - what would I do if each family member died, where they might die, how they might die, how I would support my family, what they would do, what I would do, etc. It varies from financial situations, to death, to other situations.I’ve tried soothing music. Acupuncture. Cutting out all caffeine. Rescue remedy. Lavender pillow sprays. Herbal stress relief tablets. Herbal sleep teas. Clenching one muscle at a time and then releasing. Opening a window to cool my room down. I’ve even tried drinking alcohol in the evening as depressants to help me sleep - Etc!I’ve been through a rough year - left an amazing job to move 400 miles to live with who I thought was the one, who turned out to be narcissistic and a serial cheater, spent most of my savings on my house we lived in, then in July I found the courage to end things - moved back in with my parents, and started the process of selling the house 400 miles away. I’ve only just managed to secure a job (found out Thursday) which is amazing but I’m constantly aware that I’ve set myself back immeasurably by following my heart, and this links in to the thoughts that run through my head with this adrenaline feeling.In all the issues that happened during the last year, I also gained a lot of weight. I used to be 63kg, so during October my family and I have cut out all alcohol, and have been eating healthy, mostly vegetable based dinners (but we have protein I.e fish, chicken, tofu) in almost every meal, in an attempt to lose it - and it’s been working, I’ve been losing weight steadily, as have my parents.Since this ‘anxiety’ has become more apparent over the course of October, I’m wondering if perhaps it is linked somehow to the foods I’m eating? Or is this normal to have peak periods of time where it seems worse? I ask about the foods because my mother (55F, white coat syndrome, on Lisinopril for HBP) over the past few days has complained of almost my exact symptoms - insomnia, feeling too much energy, but unlike me, she’s also become sullen and ‘in a bad mood/aggressive mood’. She’s always been what I would call a ‘worrier’, and has been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, but I:A) want to know if what I am experiencing is anxiety? Insomnia? B) want to know if this dieting could be having an effect on both me and my mother?C) want to know what the treatment might be? If it’s therapy, I know in the UK at least I can get treated quicker privately than on the NHS, so I would rather get this going as quickly as possible. D) can my UK GP tell anyone if I am diagnosed with anxiety? I don’t want to lose my job! I know it sounds strange and the above is very convoluted, but this is my first experience with anxiety and I want to make sure I have all the facts - before going to a GP and discussing this with them. The last thing I want to do is waste anyone’s time, and the ‘what is anxiety?’ websites can be less than helpful at the best of times! As I type this, it’s 03:22am. I’m desperate, please, for any advice.Thank-you to anyone in advance who responds to this, from the bottom of my heart. [info] Patient [info] 1572318982

oliviabluesky [info] How I cured myself Hi all, my name is Olivia. I am 19 and I live in England. In February 2019 I was diagnosed with anxiety and a panic disorder. In other words hypochondria or Health Anxiety. I can say now that those months were the darkest most horrible months of my entire life. It is the most horrible thing I have ever experienced and I send my love to each one of you who feel this, I know what pain and suffering you are going through and I hope my words help some what ❤️My trigger:I never intended to ever touch class A drugs. I never thought I would. I loved my drink and weed but i’d never step over the “line”. When I met my boyfriend (the love of my life) everything was the best it had ever been. He came back from a festival to tell me he’d tried Ecstasy. I was so angry with him and felt so left out. As I was also friends with his mates too. The way he described it made it sound so appealing. “You’ll have the best night of your entire life” “it makes you feel the happiest you’ve ever been”. I was terrified of trying it because of hearing the deaths from it but I did eventually and it didn’t sit right with my the first time and was so intense compared to your weed high but I wanted to fit in. So I did it again and again. This time it was amazing. I went to uni and did it instead of drinking with the worry still lingering in the back of my mind of how dangerous it is and damaging. It became my life. I had no interest in anything else. When’s the next rave? When am I next doing it? It wasn’t until February where I woke up after a heavy night on it. I felt different. The days that followed after were different. A weird aching in my chest that wouldn’t go away and was gradually getting worse. My stomach hurt too. What if I’ve damaged my heart? What if I’ve damaged my stomach? I kept needing to pee too. What if I’ve damaged my bladder? The thoughts poured in like a cancer to my brain. Fearing my drug use had messed me up. I smoked weed a lot too. Like 4 times a day. As I was miserable because I missed my boyfriend. I got offered it while I was feeling all of this. I went down and smoked it. With the thoughts in the back of my mind being, weed makes your heart beat fast, what if you have damaged your heart. I started walking to the supermarket at night. The thoughts got more intense. My heart pounding faster and faster. My chest hurting and getting tighter. Feeling lightheaded and couldn’t breath. I thought I was having a heart attack. It was actually my first ever panic attack. What came to follow was hell. At least 4 panic attacks a day. I couldn’t relax, couldn’t resist or ignore more thoughts. I got an overactive bladder which would make me pee all the time and make my bladder hurt. IBS too which would have me almost crying with the stomach cramps it gave me. My neck would tense all the time and hurt. My chest the worst, it hurt so bad and I felt it constantly even if I didn’t feel anxious which was fucked up which definitely made me think something was wrong with my heart. Any pain or weird feeling meant I was about to die. I couldn’t sleep. It was hard to eat. I couldn’t go out and do anything anymore. I had an ambulance called from having a panic attack so bad they thought I was having a heart attack. I literally thought I was going to die that night. We’ve all thought we were about to die uncountable times. I was not safe anywhere as how can you escape your own body? I didn’t feel safe in my own skin. The cure?:I thought I was going to be stuck like this my entire life. I became suicidal yet funnily enough fearing death was what my anxiety was centred around. My boyfriend, my beautiful boyfriend stuck by my side every step of the way. The state I was in, he should have walked out, I wouldn’t have blamed him. He wasn’t the best at comforting me but he stayed. He got me through it mostly. I moved home from University. Safe with my family.  No longer worrying that if I died in my sleep in my university accommodation no one would find me. I was on Propanol for a couple months. It helped a little but it made me more anxious being reliant on something that effected your heart. I tried diazepam also but that made my anxiety so much worse. I came off my medication slowly. I found that coming off it helped me so much. I had CBT therapy. It taught me what all these pains and weird feelings were. Now imagine you’re walking in the woods and a bear starts chasing you. What do you do? You run and you are scared of course. It’s the fight or flight response. You’re body is protecting you, preparing you to run. You get scared of something your heart beats fast to get your blood to your muscles so you can get away. Breathing is hard as your heart is beating so fast you aren’t used to it. The chest pains is your chest not used to functioning so highly, like an aching muscle while exercising. The lightheadedness, the sickness and numbness is blood circulation. As everything is being pushed to your muscles to get you ready to run. The need to pee all the time, making your body lighter to get away quicker. Same with being sick. What you feel it’s your body keeping you safe. If you are under stress it upsets your digestive symptom. The mind and your body are so connected. Even if you don’t feel anxious there are still subconscious thoughts causing it. You’ll all be happy to know that if you were having a heart attack your heart would be slowing not beating fast. Your heart beating fast is a really good thing. It means you are alive!!! I stopped my bad habits. Which were googling my symptoms and checking my pulse. I felt something weird I had to know what it was. I’d google it which would come up with , you have cancer which meant panic attack. Google would blow things out of proportion. I started by asking my mum to google stuff instead. Or I’d tell her what I was feeling and she’s give me a reasonable response. Feel free to go to the doctors too. It was a relief for me. I got so many tests done so I had that to hold on to know everything I was feeling was anxiety caused. I stopped checking my pulse. As soon as I weaned myself off. I stopped hearing my heart all the time. It stopped beating rapidly every time I woke up and slowly the chest pains and palpitations stopped too. The voice of reason! Curing your self takes a lot of work! You have to want it and put your all into it. My anxious voice which took the spot light in my brain had to be over thrown. Introducing the voice of reason. You have to battle your anxious thoughts with fact, reason and truth. For example, I was shopping the other day and my vision went blurred and black for a second. Old me would have lost my shit. My first thoughts were eye cancer! You’re going blind! Then the voice of reason says. When had this ever happened before? If you were going blind it would be more obvious. You didn’t get much sleep last night your body will do weird things. You have to battle till the bitter end. Practice even if it starts small. Don’t let the anxious thoughts win. I got this app for my panic attacks called beat panic. It talks you through it and without it I don’t know what I would have done. It’s blissful. I stopped drinking and drugs all together. Therefor had no trigger and allowed my brain to heal. I got a job, it helped distract me so much. It will be hard at first but slowly but surely you’ll see it fade away. I still get the odd chest pain here and there. If I feel really ill it comes out. But I’m myself again. I’m so proud of myself. You can be too. I stop an anxious thought the second it approaches. The voice of reason now has the spotlight. I haven’t had a panic attack in months. After all that worrying, I’m still here. I didn’t die after all. What does that show you? Good luck everyone, I’m always here to talk if you need advice but you can do this, I promise :) [info] None [info] 1572901293

I was tawking to one of my fwiends about my daiwy woutine, because we wewe having a deep convewsation about both of ouw anxiety issues.He said, "Do you have OCD awso?

I know it's something you'we supposed to do, but I guess I just kinda nevew had the time." He was stunned by my wevewation. "You've nevew peed befowe?!?!" Maybe it's because he had a fascination with uwine ow maybe it was just because I had nevew towd him that befowe, but he was amazed that someone had not expewience uwinating. “You NEED to twy it. In fact, wet’s go to the bathwoom. I’m going to teach you how to pee.”He wawked me into the bathwoom, and taught me how to wift up the toiwet seat. He took my hand and awwanged my fingews on the stem of my cock. “Wewax, it’s easiew than it wooks. Hewe, watch me do it.” He puwwed out his cock and stawted pissing into the toiwet. “Just wewax the muscwes in youw cwotch, and focus on the sensations inside the penis. Whenevew you feew a fowce coming outwawd of the penis, focus on it but don’t twy to contwow it. If you feew it moving inwawd, then wecognize it, and wewax the muscwes again untiw it’s moving outwawd.” I fowwowed the instwuctions and nothing happened. I said, “I can’t hewp it. I feew the fowce.

LokisPrincess [info] I was 19 when I was diagnosed with anxiety and I was put on Buspirone and another thing. I was fit and active with a great metabolism until I was put on that. Gained so much weight, became depressed, and I struggled with my anxiety. I am off it now, and I'm on a different set that's working really well, but things haven't been the same since I was on that. I'm still not able to lose the weight, and curb the hunger. Now I'm 5'9 200lbs and feel like a piece of shit for it.  [info] None [info] 1509015683

Faithyxox [info] Yeah I have a diagnosis for Asperger’s, Anxiety, and ADD. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 14, and then Asperger’s and ADD at 17. I am living away from halls this year, meaning I choose who I live with. I’m with some random people I met on Facebook this year as my flatmates ditched me (I’m living with a couple which I didn’t know about at first which is gonna be GREAT /s) so it will be a bit quieter, but hopefully I make some better friends.

CrazyProudMom25 [info] I don’t think convincing them will work.  Not from what I’ve seen on this sub. And with my nmom, even if she does concede it’s a hollow victory. She ended up convincing me to go to college instead of taking a year off school, and to do it for engineering instead of writing. I. Was. Miserable. Dropped out in a month. Six months later I was diagnosed with anxiety, social anxiety, adhd inattentive type, and got a provisional diagnosis for autism. And it’s only now, 6 years later, that she’s finally acknowledged that I sometimes am not up to doing some things, but there’s still this air of expectation that I’ll do it. I told her ‘maybe’ on something yesterday, and she told me ‘if you’re y up to it of course.’ But it felt like a hollow victory because she was assuming I’d even want to do what she suggested... because she didn’t even ask.So, I’d only try convincing them as much as you feel comfortable with, but it’s not likely to work and if it does it might be a hollow victory- maybe they’ll try to make you feel guilty about the choice but say ‘if you have to’. That sort of thing. See if you can get any friends or family to help out, talk to people, do research. Maybe you can find some easy thing for moving, maybe not. Maybe you’ll need to skip on moving things you’d like to keep but don’t need. Who knows? Just prepare as best as you can and make a lot of plans. [info] None [info] 1564142498

AguaThrowAway [info] Cymbalta for anxiety? Hey guys,&amp;#x200B;So I was diagnosed with anxiety over 10 years ago, and have been on clonazepam daily since(I know, I know).&amp;#x200B;The first anti-depressant they put me on was zoloft in 2009, and it didn't do much, but I didn't give it much of a chance. I started off with a pretty low dose and just gave up on it after 2 weeks because the clonazepam worked so much better.&amp;#x200B;After that I was put on wellbutrin, and it worked pretty well, I think I needed that somewhat stimulating effect it has. One day I just quit cold turkey, and that was that.&amp;#x200B;I've been prescribed Lexapro, and I never started taking it. &amp;#x200B;I just saw a new psychiatrist, and he prescribed me Cymbalta. Claims he takes it himself.   The thing is, I'm not horribly depressed. I struggle to get certain tasks done, and and by all means lazy, but I don't generally want to die or anything.&amp;#x200B;I've never tried therapy, and I'm finally seeing a psychologist in a few weeks, and starting CBT. Should I just not take the Cymbalta, see if therapy helps, and go from there?&amp;#x200B;I've read some AWFUL reviews on Cymbalta, and some not so bad ones. But I'm torn on what to do.

Redhaired103 [info] OP, I have to tell a story. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder but still had it undiagnosed, I went from in my safe zone to working as a waitress at a 5 star hotel's ever-crowded restaurant. The first two weeks were challenging in every way. Both physically and mentally. Physical exhaustion only made my anxiety worse. But, it was one of the best things that happened over time. I got use to the environment. I liked my co-workers and that place started to become another safe space for me. Even with the customers that were problematic, I didn't really care because it was still *my* safe space, with some fun co-workers I liked. I tell this story because while your 'bad scenario' is an option, my experience and alike are also definitely on the table.But let's say things didn't work out at this job. I think of the things us with anxiety disorder sometimes don't totally accept is that this wouldn't be the end of the world. There are zillions of jobs out there with different work environment, different work duties, different co-workers. Yes, you might not make enough money for the life standard you would like to have at all of them, but "paying the bills"... the chances are you can find a job like that. And please please please don't forget, you are not *stuck* at any job. Another common thing I see is that we feel like whatever situation we are in, sometimes we feel that will always be our situation. It's not. If you don't like the job, if you want to leave, you can do it anytime you want. One of my best friends is an employer. She did have employees over the years who quit after a week, didn't show up at work, etc Some had good reasons (anxiety is a valid reason), some were just irresponsible like they went on a date instead. She never thought badly about the people who couldn't continue to work over health reasons, including mental health. Her employees actually don't know this but she suffers from anxiety disorder herself and gets panic attacks, sometimes at work. The moral of the story: more people are familiar with anxiety disorder than you think. They won't even think badly about you, nor they expect you to have an incredible performance in the beginning, regardless of if you have anxiety or not.Give it a try. If things work out, great. If things don't work out, not the end of the world. [info] None [info] 1532264370

I can't go to a therapist because I'm 15 and my parents don't believe in therapy, even my doctor told me to "wait for my anxiety to disappear."

MagicHobbes [info] I don't mean to hijack the top comment but I sort of need help myself. I know for a fact I don't have insomnia. I've been diagnosed with anxiety but my lack of sleep goes past that.I spend a lot of time in front of a screen. It's the just the way my life works at the moment with work, school, and free time. I enjoy it, I love computers and I like spending time doing things I enjoy but my lack of sleep is really bothering me more and more.The problem is I've tried different methods (like turning everything off early, taking melatonin, etc.) but nothing seems to work consistently or for long enough. /r/asmr does work sometimes but it's not nearly consistent enough to rely on.I feel like there's nothing I can do to fix my sleep patterns. I'm simply thinking about way too much if I'm just lying there and I get stressed out and NEED to watch a video or something to help me fall asleep. I don't spend all of my time on my computer by any means (and I absolutely love hanging out in the real world with people I care about) but it is both good work and a really important hobby to me so I can't just give up electronics completely.I just don't know what to call my problems and I don't know what I have. I guess I'm just wondering if you have any advice? Sorry for the super long comment.**TL;DR:** I just am thinking about too much if I'm simply lying in bed with nothing happening. It's like I NEED to distract my brain to trick it into sleep. /r/asmr has been the best method but I need a way to get consistent with my sleep schedule. [info] None [info] 1394522336
ClovisBlack [info] For a bit more context, I used to be considered a gifted student, but I've struggled monumentally with school as I've gotten into my teen years. I've been agonizing over being told by adults that if I don't pull it together, I'll be stuck working jobs that won't satisfy me. I've been slowly and sadly accepting the fact that I may not graduate with grades that qualify me for a college education.There's absolutely nothing wrong with non college requiring jobs, but I've had dreams of being a psychotherapist ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety :) this is a huge deal to me.

BlueInkSz [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety issues at first. The foundations of my paranoia/"paranoia" are things that are completely possible, even though I have been unable to fathom a true reason behind them. An old therapist of mine said it was anxiety related. Fast forward a few years and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia by someone who had far less information. Of course, I fully realize I've gone off the rails with paranoia at times, which really sucks, because there are certain things in my life that actually happened that no one takes seriously anymore. Long story short, schizophrenia is the convenient excuse and some people are manipulative scum.Of course, since I know people with schizophrenia who believe such things are a dime a dozen, I don't expect to be believed. But yeah, at first it was all anxiety issues. I had some bizarre thoughts that came and went, but for the most part it was believable stuff. C'est la vie. [info] None [info] 1569896304
colonialnerd [info] I don't even know what to call this, shit just sucks. I'm a transgender teenager, I have to go into the doctor's office every week to get shots, I am diagnosed with anxiety and I haven't been able to get proper therapy in months. The best I can do is the school therapist right now and for that, I have to leave my classes. I'm a full-time student, I can't drive, and most places won't hire me because I'm too young. This is all regular stuff for me, but things get worse.My mom is having a hip replacement next week and my grandma has to stay with us, she is "a product of her time" to put things lightly. We have two other people staying with us who are the literal definition of that saying "were you born in a barn?" seriously, they got kicked out of their old house for messing the place up and not paying rent. I have to share a room with one when my grandmother comes to stay for over a week while I still have school. My dad is the only one working now and is never home. I have been the only one delegated new chores in my family (well at least more than two) My dad got floors and trash, and one of the people staying with us got guinea pig cages (they are her guinea pigs and we have to tell her to take care of them and she lets them run wild and I'm going to have to share a room with that), the bathroom, and her own laundry. I got feed cats twice a day, feed fish twice a day, make lunches, cook dinner, dishes, laundry, litterboxes, water bowls, room cleaning, and tea service for my mom. The only alone time I've gotten in the months they've been here have been me locked in my room and I've been continuously shamed for it by my parents and now they're making me share a room to top it all off. I've been falling behind in my classes because I'm falling asleep in them since I haven't been able to sleep and because I keep getting taken out for therapy. And finally, my mom has been in such great pain in these days leading up to her surgery all she does is yell at me and tell me I don't do enough for this house.

fancypattie [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety in the past. I do have that pretty well under control.

derekjlight [info] Running out of options...? Long story short(er). I was diagnosed with anxiety/OCD when I was about 10 year old. About 8 months ago I got off of medication for the first time in 23 years. Very slowly my anxiety levels have been creeping back up. I call it my "coping level". It feels like things affect me much more than before and I feel overwhelmed much easier. A couple of months ago we had a very tragic death in our family, very sudden. This obviously did not help but didn't seem to make things terribly worse for me. Plus side of getting off of meds is that I have lost 70 pounds and am gaining more self-confidence, so that does help some. I have tried several supplements like 5-HTP and Ashwagandha, not sure if either have helped. I am not depressed at all. I just don't feel like myself anymore, and don't get much satisfaction out of the day. [info] None [info] 1558814584

Sheehan7 [info] I feel like a failure who has no job future I'm 20, going into my 3rd year of community college as a business administration major, and honestly I need some guidance. Tbh I'm not very good at school, never have been, and my GPA is a 2.6 (graduated HS with a 1.8). I want to work in the automotive or mental health field, maybe fashion but probably not, but outside of that I have no idea what I want to do. I took a full time IT internship this summer at an office and hated it, hated it so much that I had a mental breakdown two months in one day at the office and left forever. Since then I've been diagnosed with anxiety, put on medication, and I'm seeing a therapist this month. That whole situation has made me think I will never be able to work a full time office job and I feel like a failure. I do, however, work retail at a clothing store part time, and I've been there for 9 months. While I'm there I feel very calm, I'm apparently one of the best associates, always on time, good sales, friendly, etc. but I can't work retail forever, $10/hour is no livable wage. This again makes me feel like a failure. I have no idea what to do. I don't understand why my anxiety was terrible at the cushy office job but it's fine at the high stress retail job. I thought of dropping out of college to go to mechanic school, but what if I go through that and find out being a mechanic makes me just as unhappy as the office job did? Then I could drop out of college for a while but that will just land me in the retail world and then I'll feel like a failure. I also don't want to get a degree if It will just end up like the internship all over again. What do I do? I'm so lost. [info] None [info] 1473038505
JayJay729 [info] I have very little body fat and have some nice definition. My problem is that I have difficulty eating exorbitant amounts of food and therefore have trouble putting on weight and staying energized at the gym. I have found that SS requires lots and lots of eating and energy. I know I need to eat more, but I just have trouble doing so. I have been diagnosed with anxiety (GAD) and my lack of appetite is one of my biggest symptoms. When I'm hungry, I eat, and eat some more, but there are times during the day when I just don't feel hungry.

fredemar [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder back in 2007 and got my first panic attack in 2010. For me it was also a point in my life when I was stressed out about multiple things, and I just snapped I guess. That feeling of your first panic attack stays with you for a while, it's scary. It helped me to see a psych about it. With her I trained so that I could feel the panic attacks coming, and knew what to do. For me I start having a tingling feeling in my arms, signaling that I need to get up and go do some exercises (that makes them 'go away' most of the time). She also made me realise that the things I feel when having a panic attack is normal, it's my body and it happens even during my 'downtime'. So during a panic attack I have a high heart rate, so she made me do jumping jacks until my heart rate was up when I was feeling good. Same thing about dizziness. [info] None [info] 1568995633
lovemesomezombie [info] Exactly! I will make this long story as short as possible. I was at a very large work related awards banquet. I found myself crying in the bathroom because I felt like I didn't have anyone there that liked me or wanted me to sit with them. A couple girls asked me to sit with them and tried to make me feel comfortable. I was very emotional as this was a feeling I carried all the time. It didn't matter if I had friends, I always felt like I wasn't really liked. There was never a reason from the outside but this is how I felt internally. That night I won the "Rookie of the Year" award out of 200 people and got a standing ovation so somebody liked me. Not long after that, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.

mariposa-indigo [info] Obsessive-compulsive disorder and zen Hi!I have some very recurring thoughts and get worried by them. These worries are accompanied by songs that get stuck in my head frequently, all the day, with anxiety too. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I used to practice compulsions, but now is more the obsessive part. I wonder if I'm attached to this "diagnostic". When I breathe, it seems that I can let go this thought of "worried, worried, worried" that keeps coming, but it's for short moments. "What if" thoughts with the "worst case scenarios" keeps popping all the time, like something very bad is about to happen. Then it becomes hard to breath, pains starts to appear and I get stressed. Mindfulness helps me a lot.Sometimes I feel very negative and somehow... something! arises and I calm down. I don't know what is... love, peace. Them I get distracted by the obsessions again.Is that an identification? Like, my mind is creating the same structure of conflicts? Creating conflict so I can calm down... Creating conflict so I can calm down? I don't have panic attacks, though. Even getting peaceful is a reason for the mind to argue about it "you are too peaceful".Thanks for the help!

SubjectShape [info] So I started realizing there were issues and got diagnosed with IBS. I started by keeping a food journal to see if I could figure out what was setting it off, but there wasn't anything linking the IBS. Not to say it was useless coz I found out some other stuff, but it seemed like my IBS hit no matter what I was eating.I have been diagnosed with anxiety, but when I moved I left my therapist and lost my insurance so I can't afford to see a therapist anymore. But while reading about IBS I saw someone suggesting it might be an anxiety response, so I started keeping an anxiety journal instead. Basically whenever I recognized I was super anxious about something I'd write down when that happened and what I was anxious about. Sure enough my IBS symptoms were almost always right behind anything that majorly set off my anxiety.Since then I've had to be better about my anxiety and find ways to manage it without a therapist and meds. Edibles help since they're legal here, but they are also semi-expensive so not always accessible. Meditation has been a huge help, just spending a few minutes in the morning when I get up to sit and be mindful of my body and how I'm feeling that morning. I still get stressed, of course, but knowing that it's coming because I can feel that stress building up is also very helpful. Plus I just like....don't leave the house except once a week to do groceries and I always make sure to go early in the morning so I haven't eaten breakfast yet. I work from home, I have a dog to help with my anxiety, I keep on a pretty tight schedule in terms of waking up, going to bed, working, ect.The thing is like....everyone's anxiety is different, so how I control mine may not be what works for someone else. I control my environment to control my anxiety and do the best I can to cope when that's not possible, both with the anxiety and with the IBS. [info] None [info] 1567109327
JETMAZER [info] I don’t know what to do rn I was diagnosed with anxiety last year and it’s been hard ever sinceI feel so alone in the world, I only have one new friend in high school (just got into high school this year) but I don’t even know if he’s my friend, he pushed me around physically, like just as a joke but I don’t know if I feel good about it, and the other day he was begging me for money and got annoyed that I didn’t give him any money.I don’t want to stop being his friend because I am so scared about what might happen if I do. I’m so lonely I also went to an abusive therapist that just sat there the whole session whilst I cried and saying stuff like, calm down, take deep breaths, stop acting like a 2 yr oldSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UPAnd my mum paid so much money for that therapist and I feel so sorry for her because I know I am a pain in the ass to her and an embarrassment to her and her life would be easier if I were gone.I just want friends to talk to, friends that understand what I’m going through friends that don’t minds the fact my fucking voice hasn’t dropped yet, I sound like a 6 yr old or that that I can’t pronounce my r’s correctly.

WTF_Christine [info] I went through a bad breakup at the same time my parents were divorcing. My dad asked me to move home because he had this huge house and no one to help take care of it.I did most of the cleaning and was able to stay on top of it, even while enrolled full time in college. However, my dad's entire family was coming for Thanksgiving and he wanted the house to be "deep cleaned" so he hired a professional cleaner.I came home from class one day and the cleaner had washed dishes. No big deal. But as I went to unload them, I noticed she loaded them differently than I loaded them and I had a full on melt down, including screaming and hysterically crying. It lasted about 10 minutes.Afterwards I called my doctor and told her that I thought I was having a mental breakdown and she had me come in immediately. I was diagnosed with anxiety.Turns out I have BPD.  [info] None [info] 1551417778
Markmange [info] Why am I so miserable? I just recently started a new job, a job which in theory I should be over the moon about, it's better pay and more experience and benefits than I could ask for... But whenever I'm there I just can't wait to leave.I long for weekends, not because it's free time to do things but because it's the only time where I get to lie or sit down and do literally nothing, I don't want to do anything, no hobbies, no interests, I do things only because they're required to stay alive (eat, drink etc.).I have a dog who for the most part at least adds some form of stimulation to my life, I enjoy his company but at the end of it all, I have no energy or great desire to play with him, explore with him or do anything but sit on the couch and cuddle with him.. I take him for exercise not because I want to but because he needs it, and I feel like a bastard for being this way.I like where I stay, granted, I hate my neighbor's but they have next to no impact on how I feel. My home is my own and I can do what I want when I want, but that what is always nothing whatsoever.I've been diagnosed with anxiety issues in the past and put on meds for it, and while it keeps me chill (and helps me sleep so damn well) and originally helped me from freezing up and having a panic attack, now I don't even worry about that, when I get anxious, I just feel fucking miserable, like I want to be immediately erased from the situation, with a massive god sized eraser.Last time I went to the doctor in regards to this they basically said"Don't smoke dope and fix your life. You're not depressed"So I did that. I've not smoked weed in over a year, I've got a new home, new job, new life really...But I'm still god damn miserable!I'm running out of ideas now, and beginning to fail to see the point in even trying, if I didn't have my dog, I'd have probably given up by now.

Snitchwithabitch [info] Anxiety or something else? I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder for about 3 years now. Recently i am feeling disconnected with surroundings like memory loss or something like that i don't know who am i and what i am doin on this planet what's the objective, it sounds like a existential crisis but i think it's different it used to drive me to a panic attack but now this feeling has become more prevalent. I don't know what this is, is this psychosis? [info] None [info] 1569609612
maydsilee [info] I've noticed in many situations where I thought I was following my dog's instinct, I realized in hindsight that my gut was already telling me a situation was bad, if that makes sense? Like, I probably realized subconsciously that something wasn't right or someone was making me uncomfortable, and then my dog picked up on my own body language (me tensing, for example). Since he can show it better than me (his hackles rising, or shifting uneasily next to me, or not wanting to walk past someone, etc.), I listened to him and would change direction or avoid that person. A lot of people don't get just how much their body language rubs off on their dogs, who notice you're uneasy, so then they're uneasy. It's why trainers stress to clients often that their own feelings rubs off on their dogs.Of course, it's also not absolute :P I'm diagnosed with anxiety, so a *lot* of things make me uneasy, and my dog notices that, so...it's definitely not clear-cut lol!

Admiralfrewt [info] Hey y'all! New user here with a BUNCH of questions Background: I have been diagnosed with anxiety and perscribed 5mg Valium as needed. I have not been taking it because I hate feeling "couch-locked" for hours (same reason I don't enjoy smoking marijuana). I have pretty constant anxiety all day, but manageable with few and far between actual panic attacks. I used to smoke cigarettes/ vape nicotine but have quit for almost a year.I went to a vape shop two weeks ago and had a new rig set up (I use an RDA instead of a tank) to just vape 0mg nicotine for the mechanical satisfaction of smoking something. But I also bought a little CBD vape pen. The brand of CBD liquid is "The Clear" with 500mg of 220 mg CBD The guy at the store told me it would last me a while but I went through it in a week to which the guy said that it was unheard of that I would go through one so fast. I felt like I wasn't getting much effect unless I had 2-3 puffs every few hours. Now these disposable pens are very expensive ($40!). I think my alternative is buying the flowers. But I want opinions from experts/ experienced users. Should I try the flowers as a cheaper alternative? Should I be regular dosing with oil? Please give me all advice and insights! I want to be educated! [info] None [info] 1555431897
NI1515 [info] Very sharp pain in head when hit with anxiety - should I be concerned? I'm a white 21 year old male, 5'9, and around 145lbs. I'm currently on 200mg Lamictal daily for HPPD. Alongside HPPD, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD.For around a month, I've been experiencing a sharp piercing pain in my head whenever I experience a "hit" of anxiety, or even remote nervousness. It's sort of hard to explain what I mean by hit, but basically just when you get that "drop" in your stomach. Like I said, this occurs through general nervousness, not just intense anxiety. For example, I was nervous about kissing someone and as I leaned in I got the sharp pain in my head again.I thought it could just potentially be tension headaches. But the strange thing is - the past month or so has possibly been the least stressful month I've had in the past 7 or so months, and I've generally been having a great time. In addition, the pain is always right on time with the "hit" of anxiety and is very short lasting - about the length of the "drop" in my stomach.I'm a little concerned. Any thoughts?

MakeupMua16 [info] Has anyone ever had constant itching in one particular spot every day but then it stopped completely once they started taking benzodiazepines? Like I have itching Only or I should say 98% only at night. sometimes it gets really bad that it doesn’t happen till it wakes me up in the middle of the night not going to say where (you can probably guess) it’s too tmi and it only happens every single night (btw already checked by 4 different drs I know and I don’t have a rash/redness visible, no bumps, no hemorrhoids or pinworms). Only maybe 1-3x does it happen during the day a month or not even that. A year and up to about a month or two before the itching started I was on an Ssri (first ever anxiety medication taken) for anxiety called Paxil hated it because it caused me to gain a whopping 50 pounds so I went off and didn’t find that I really had anxiety that bad that I needed a medication just primary dr thought I did for social anxiety. Anyways had panic attack about two months ago my first ever and oddly when I was at the worst of the attack for the first week or two where I would get tremors in my stomach, extreme nausea, couldn’t sleep 4 days in a row the itching stopped randomly (still wasn’t on any medication yet oh wait I did take Zoloft for 2 days the day after my attack happened hated that it didn’t help immediately so cut it off cold turkey) then because this was my first panic attack and I didn’t know it was a panic attack I had went to the ER three times within two weeks and every time I was diagnosed with anxiety reaction I even had blood testing (every visit) brain scans done and ekg and a stomach ultrasound and all came back fine. and the third time I actually got a prescription from the ER doctor for Ativan not just giving me the iv and sending me with nothing home. The Ativan worked good stopped my itching completely but I hate how innorder for it to help my other anxiety symptoms I had to take it every 7-8 hours or it would wear off quite quickly. Now my psychiatrist who I hadn’t seen in a year since being off Paxil switched me to valium 5mg two pills 3x a day and my itching has stopped now we are trying to get off the benzos and onto more of a long term medication like an Ssri. So today we started in the morning to cut down drs orders to taking one pill 3x a day and I could immediately notice the itching came back when I woke up. Do you think then that itching like this is an anxiety related problem if regular and hemorrhoid specialist doctors couldn’t find a medical problem wrong with why I am itching and only at night?

im_your_bullet [info] 27 with Anxiety and I'm asking for your help. Hello, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and ptsd from my time in Afghanistan. PTSD not so much, but the anxiety is terrible. We got back in the states in  2013, In 2015 (yep took this long) is when I was diagnosed. I was prescribed anxiety meds and they made me feel like an emotionless zombie (which right now I would take). I stopped taking them because of the zombie like state they put me in. Because I was. No longer taking meds I started to self medicate with cannabis. BEST medicine yet. For me, it helps instantly and usually for the entire day. With that being said, I'm in vacation with my family. I'm in a place that Cannabis is still illegal and I usually don't medicate around my family. They would understand but I just like to be sober unless I'm home. Well, as you guessed, my anxiety is going crazy.  It's just this terrible feeling that's over my entire body. I'm only here for a week, but I would really like to enjoy it. Going to do some meditation as soon as I'm done writing this. I keep getting hot flashes followed by sweat. Any over the counter medicine I could go to a store and buy?  I would just like to not feel this way for the next five days while we are here. Thanks in advance. [info] None [info] 1494802383
SenorVolf [info] I'm a firm believer in the paranormal, but this seems like your average, every day anxiety. I remember when I was accepted into college after deciding to transfer schools, and I got my notice of acceptance only a week before classes began, the exact same thing happened to me when I saw my boss at work. Overwhelming fear, feelings of dread. I was diagnosed with anxiety years before this ever happened, and never felt a thing like this until I had my first panic attack. I was so concerned with my feelings from that day that I had to see my doctor about it. It's really amazing how simple nervousness can manifest itself.Edit:  I read this again and noticed you said you were specifically afraid of the man, not the situation. It still sounds like an anxiety issue to me. It can manifest differently for every person and every attack is different. I've had more than a few where I've been afraid of one person in particular. I had one, once, where I had an overwhelming fear that I was going to kill myself. I didn't want to kill myself, I had never been suicidal, but I was still so scared that I was going to be compelled to kill myself that I put all the knives in our pantry and went for a walk, just to get away from them.I'm not saying that something paranormal didn't happen to you, 'cause I obviously wasn't there. But if it were me, I would honestly just chalk it up to anxiety. [info] None [info] 1520715536
babykittiesyay [info] So I'm coming into this from maybe a different background, I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and "severe major depressive disorder" (yes, that's actually what's on my charts, lol). I'm also a FTM.The anxiety has been way worse than I've experienced before. Partly, I think it's that my emotions are turned up to 11 from all the hormones, which might continue for the whole pregnancy but definitely not past that. This is probably the first thing to remind yourself of, this is temporary. It's also good to remind yourself of all the people you know of who are parents. Are they all perfect? Humans have been making it through all this for millennia. Make sure to check in with yourself about the effects these worries are having on you. Are they keeping you from getting things done, taking up a lot of time, messing with your breathing or heart rate significantly? If yes, it's time to chat with your doctor. It's very normal to be nervous, it's also pretty common to develop anxiety disorders in pregnancy, between the hormones, the information overload, and the huge responsibility. Getting care sooner will hep prevent any temporary issue from becoming long-term. We can do this! [info] None [info] 1546283184
Violinchan [info] Idek if I have disassociation or anxiety anymore I was diagnosed with anxiety, but as long as I can remember there are sudden periods on random days where I feel extremely uncomfortable (like baddd) because I feel detached from people I normally know. For example, I could be sitting in the living room and suddenly I would feel so horrible being and talking with my parents because they felt like strangers and everything felt fake. I also saw the world from the view of “space” sometimes as a child. Right now I also have the weird, weird feeling. Like I’m dreaming and not exactly in my surroundings, but also extremely anxious. Point is, I’m confused. [info] None [info] 1565673427
-partlycloudy- [info] And if you absolutely have to check if that weird feeling in a particular body part is really just caused by anxiety, include the literal word “anxiety” in your search.

YeahXynni [info] 19/M/EST (Up late nights) Looking to binge games/anime with someone :) &amp;#x200B;Hey everyone, I'm Drew and I live in Massachusetts. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I'm self-employed and intend to be for the rest of my life. A few years ago I streamed World of Warcraft full-time, and played semi-professionally in the eSports scene for WoW, Heroes of the Storm, Smash Brawl/Melee (Shiek Main) and Rocket League. After quitting streaming due to anxiety I spent a long time figuring out exactly what I wanted to do. I'm diagnosed with anxiety and currently medicated to great success. I started taking courses online for marketing analytics and I currently self-employ myself as a stock/currency trader. I'm very new to the process, but have seen great returns and aspire to do even better to help pay off my mothers' car and my grandparents' house.&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I'm posting on Reddit because I'm lonely at times. As someone who lives with anxiety, it's not likely that I'll often go out of my way to meet people in the real world. The majority of the friends I've made throughout the years are from WoW. This is an issue because I finally decided to quit the game a few months ago after playing for nearly 15 years. My friends solely play WoW, so I won't be interacting with them as much. &amp;#x200B;I'm looking to find chill people who have time to hang out regularly. I'm a chill, outgoing person, but I have a dark sense of humor and I'm very honest and upfront with my thoughts. If you're the type to be offended by jokes or whatnot, I'm not your guy. Since I work from home and have diagnosed insomnia, I'm active A LOT. &amp;#x200B;I love to invest time into large projects with a person. Whether this be starting a new game from scratch and playing the entire thing out, or binge watching a Netflix/Anime series, etc.  &amp;#x200B;To explain what exactly I'm looking for in a **perfect world** :\-  Someone who has a generous amount of free time.\-  Someone who loves video games. \-  Someone who enjoys anime and/or watching shows and movies together. \-  Someone who doesn't get offended.\-  Someone who loves playing video games with a partner. \-  Someone who isn't picky on what type of game they play.\-  Someone who has a voice for themselves.\-  Someone who is outgoing. &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Here's some random extra information about me :&amp;#x200B;\-  When I played WoW during a competitive raid season, I would be investing up to 18 hours a night. When I wasn't raiding, I was preparing other characters and grinding the game more.&amp;#x200B;\-  Because of how often I played WoW, I had little to no time to play anything else. This was an ongoing trend throughout my entire history of the game. Because of this, there are TONS of games that I haven't had the time to play up until recently quitting. From the span of 04' to 18', I never got the chance to play games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher, Divinity, all of the Fallouts', etc. &amp;#x200B;\-  When it comes to playing video games, one of my primary goals is to fully complete the game. Side-quests, hidden shit, DLC, collectibles, etc. On top of this, I want to \*fully complete\* Every game on the steam Marketplace. I'm sure you can tell I have a lot of spare time.  &amp;#x200B;\- I'm clingy, but I can take a hint. (*Not retarded*)&amp;#x200B;\-  I have a pretty deep voice.\-  I've played with members of Midwinter, Method, TSM, Cloud9 and Limit.\-  I have a western terrier named Max, and two orange tabbies that hate each other.\-  Sometimes I prefer no beard, sometimes I prefer a beard.\-  I binge a lot of shit. Anime, random games, Netflix.&amp;#x200B;\-  I started watching anime on-and-off about a year ago, I've seen about a dozen series; the most basic recommended ones such as DB, Attack on Titan, SAO, but it gets boring watching em alone. I have a big list of anime I plan on watching.&amp;#x200B;\-  I have consoles, but I play on PC most of the time.\-  I play piano, guitar, bass, drums and used to sing in chorus. (bass/low bari)\-  I'm great with money, I keep numerous notepads on my financial analytics and track my growth. \-  One of my personal goals in life is to own every steam game / DLC on one account.\-  I want to be fully retired in a paid off estate before I'm 30.\-  I own contacts, but I prefer to wear glasses most times. Doesn't matter too much to what I use.\-  I'm currently grinding Black Ops 4, but I'm down to play whatever with people.\-  I would love to start a Baldur's Gate playthrough with someone.&amp;#x200B;\-  If you want to know what games I play, I'd be happy to share my library/steam accounts. I have a ton of games and wouldn't mind buying one to play with someone if I like the game.PM me if you're interested :D&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;\-Drew&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B; [info] None [info] 1540438753
AgitatedBrilliant [info] I'm not sure who I am anymore or how I got here but here I come So, a few days ago I was diagnosed with anxiety.

I get it sometimes when I go to grocery stores, and when i'm around a lot of unfamiliar or only-slightly-familiar people in a scenario where there isn't a really specific prescribed sort of action-we're-supposed-to-do (e.g. parties w/ like 20-30 people are often bad, but audiences with like 200-300 people are fine).I'm not real clear on where the neurotypicality line is, heh.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and agoraphobia and am terrified of getting a job. My parents know this, but that doesn't stop my grandparents and other family members constantly asking when I'm getting a job.  My grandparents constantly tut at me because I'm "wasting my potential". Because I'm the most "academic" and "the smartest" of my cousins, they see me as a disappointment.

Ethanyolo1999 [info] Lots of strange things I have been feeling for a while I have been diagnosed with anxiety and am unsure if this list of strange symptoms are related or something else. Something I have experienced for a long time is very strange, the first experience was when I was say 5, I feel extremely uncomfortable with the inferred transmitters on tv remotes pointing at my body and it is phisicaly uncomfortable to the point where I have to move it, I get funny about lots of these small things and it gets really bad if I can’t stop it. One that bothers me constantly is the fear of cutting of circulation, where I cannot wear tight clothing or even put my wrist over the edge of the table. Another strange thing recently is that my surroundings seem to change, such as distance changing and objects changing size and visual clarity seems to change too, none of these are really distorting or changing anything and don’t effect balance or depth perception. An example of this is is when using my phone it can seem to be closer to my face and and then seem to get further away with like tunnel vision and can appear allmost like HD sometimes (best way I can describe it). It makes it seem as if common things such as rooms I am familiar with seem to be bigger or smaller for no reason. Also maybe not mental health but I experience bad vertigo often, where I allmost lose vision at times just from standing up from the couch. I have spent lots of time in hospital and my blood pressure and heart is healthy and normal.Thankyou in advance for any insight! [info] None [info] 1556448169
hurtstobealive [info] I get the point of this post but I don’t think it’s right to downplay someone’s mental illness because you think you have it worse. It’s kind of like a spectrum, sure everyone has anxiety (as long as you have a nervous system) but everyone’s is different in terms of strength and in different situations. Social anxiety can also make a person rude or defensive because when ur anxious ur body is literally in defensive mode so I also disagree with your point there. I am diagnosed with anxiety but I knew I had anxiety way before I was ever diagnosed so I don’t think a diagnoses really matters. I mean it’s not like doctors really do anything special to diagnose you they just ask you like a few questions. Lots of mentally ill people can’t afford doctors or even know that they need help.

Morphiadz [info] Sleep apnea or anxiety? I am female and I am 19 years old. I am not diagnosed with sleep apnea. The doctor sent me for a sleep study which is happening in November or December, or possibly January.I am diagnosed with anxiety. Here is the issue. I am not anxious about anything anymore. My anxiety is pretty much entirely gone. My doctor passes off all symptoms as anxiety. I continue to explain I literally have no anxiety, and I am very happy and calm.My symptoms are as follows:- dry mouth, especially in the morning- very very bad fatigue, all day long- cannot focus, cannot get anything done, just too tired to push myself- bad vision, somewhat blurry vision- sometimes waking with sore throats, quite bad- palpitations (never had them even when I had bad anxiety years ago)I am reluctant to try a medication because I don't want to be on a medication for anxiety when I honestly do not think this is anxiety. I could just try it and see, but it is a long process (takes a month or more to kick in) and the first few weeks are always full of horrible symptoms until your body gets used to it. I don't want to go through this at a time when I need to be focusing (I am a student). I don't feel any anxiety. I don't know what to do about how fatigued I am constantly. Also, I have hypothyroidism and I am on a medication. I don't believe this is related to that as my TSH is under 1. [info] None [info] 1505248781

Think of that split second feeling, but imagine that it lasts way way longer than a split second. Now think of trying to anything never the less playing a football game in front of tons of people. Glad he was able to get diagnosed. Before I figured it was fucking horrible.  [info]  [info] 1481769645

billbobb1 [info] So once you have anxiety, does it ever go away? I had my first anxiety attack, in my mid thirties, five years ago. I was diagnosed with anxiety soon after. I dived right into therapy, doing all the work I was told to by my therapist. I had successfull results.  I thought I was fine. Then had another anxiety attack two years ago while swimming. I just had my third anxiety attack driving across a bridge that I have driven over at least 100 times throughout the years.  I was with my family and in laws and it was humiliating. As my mother in law is old school Peruvian and no considers me as less of a man and calls me a scaredy-cat. We’ve never had the best relationship. I am use to living an active life. Before this happened, I was studying to get my pilots license, now I’m heartbroken and afraid to follow through with my training because I’m afraid of what might happen in the air. My point being, once you have an anxiety attack is it just a matter of time before another one hits?  Once you have anxiety, do you always have it?  For the rest of my life, is it just about managing anxiety?  Does anxiety ever completely go away? [info] None [info] 1514868267
zekobunny [info] Had a serious anxiety attack last night Hello guys, I think this is an appropriate place to post.Some info about me. I am diagnosed with anxiety and deppression and take SSRI meds daily. I also enjoy smoking a joint every few days and never considered myself as someone who has a problem with weed.Last night, after a one week long t break, I decided that I shall smoke a joint before bed and chill a little bit. It all went well, I listened to some music, everything was nice and all. At one point I decided to go to bed and try and sleep, so I did.I successfully fell asleep but at about 5 in the morning I was woken up by the most dreadful feeling of fear, panic, shaking... I felt like I am the only person in World feeling like this and that I am fucked. The feeling is very hard to describe but it used to happen to me when I was younger (back when I wasn't even smoking). This time it felt serious though, my body felt like it was in grave danger but I knew there was no reason to feel like that, I was shaking head to toe and was seriously afraid for my life. I guess this is what they call an actual anxiety or panic attack.At the end I had to tell my dad I was feeling bad just so I could have someone comfort me and tell me that I would be alright. I decided to take my perscribed Lorazepam and tried going back to sleep, later the feeling went away. I don't know if weed triggered it somehow, I've never had problem with weed before. Maybe it's the combinaton of SSRIs and weed and even some caffeine. What are your thoughts, this was seriously a scary experience that I really want to avoid in the future.

hushxx18 [info] Tips for anxiety? I been having really bad anxiety for the past two weeks. It feels like I’m going crazy (when I’m not) Some background info; I have been diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 14. I’m almost 20 now. I have these rough periods every couple years but usually I’m okay. I haven’t had anxiety in over a year- maybe two, so it hit me really hard. It’s the same old same old, cant breathe, intrusive thoughts/ thoughts that don’t make sense, can’t sleep, feels like I’m going crazy, but the newest one is derealization, where it feels like I’m not in control of my body. I don’t have many friends so I can’t do things or talk to people to get my mind off. And my family is extremely abusive and won’t be much of a help to speak to. Advice would be welcomed [info] None [info] 1559624660
ZT20 [info] 5 visits to the ER later: Healthy EKG, Blood Test, and X-ray indicating no heart problem... But my palpatations are now occasionally waking me up, and this morning I felt a non-painful but paralyzing sensation in my chest for about 2 seconds. (31/M) Height: 6'0" Weight: 302 lb Race: WhiteSo this is something I am continuing to battle, I had previously posted about this before but its continuing to worry me. This morning at around 7 AM I woke up to a single, noticeable heart palpatation but no other signs or symptoms of anything. I felt fine, and quickly calmed down. Since I was wide awake, I went on with my morning as normal before deciding to lay back down around 10 AM. After drifting in and out of consciousness multiple times and having a number of very brief "dreams" of getting up or talking to my roommate (which I quickly realized was a dream as I came to), I finally had this weird feeling, almost like a very pronounced tingling in most of my chest. I couldn't move or say anything for about two seconds, and then it passed completely. Heart rate after both incidents seems normal, though the wave pattern on my heart monitor app is occasionally weird looking when I hold it for 60 seconds (I have no idea if this is normal or not). I feel absolutely fine now, a few hours past, and as I said in the title above, the ER has run 4 EKG which all indicate no abnormalities, 2 blood tests that didn't pick up anything, and an X-ray that showed no signs of heart damage. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and given  0.5mg Lorazepam for it, which I've been taking irregularly because they only gave me 20 pills and was instructed to take "as needed".Again, I feel completely normal now, and had several days where I felt fine all day, but when this happened I was quite shook, to say the least. Could anxiety induce some kind of sleep paralysis or anything of the sort that could feel like this? [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1572627395
AverageRedditorMaybe [info] Dunno if 1 in a million but here goes. When I was 13 I smoked some spice not sure how much a little over a bowl of it. This is the same shit that killed otherwise healthy adults. I was born with Marfan syndrome so I have heart issues. Now immediately after smoking it this time I noticed something was way wrong compared to the other 10 or so times I’ve smoked it. Not sure what it was as I don’t completely remember but I rushed home and said I need to go to the hospital and told my mom everything. My uncle said to sleep I was having a bad trip I’ll be okay. Mom took me to the hospital where they rushed me in put me on an iv and oxygen to purge stuff out of my system everyone was clambering around and I remember taking a look at the heart monitor thingy. I saw my bpm rising 140,150,170,180,190 I started to think my heart was gonna give out completely at that moment and just flipped my shit. I managed to calm down due to this cool nurse talking me through it. At the time I was completely detached from reality and felt like I was in a dream. No exaggerations everything felt fabricated. My hearing felt distorted and had a ring to it. My vision was cloudy and tunneled. I pulled through when 10 mins later a cop came in to ask me some questions. He told me “yknow you got really lucky, when they called me down here they told me I would be here to arrest your mother and I wouldn’t be able to ask you any questions” implying that the doctors thought I wasn’t gonna survive. Still alive today with ptsd related toward any drugs. Took me 2 or so years to recover from that dreamy state. Imagine 2 years of feeling like you’re still in a dream. After that I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder but at least  I’m still alive. [info] None [info] 1550745655

oddestowl [info] Yes!I have been diagnosed with anxiety because I actually was anxious. I felt wrong and I knew it was stemming from my mind. It was absolutely a mental issue because I was worrying about things for no reason and I couldn’t stop it. I have also been to the doctors and said “I feel anxious, I am not anxious, but these sensations are anxiety. I am a fairly self aware person and I do not feel anxious in my head, these feelings are stemming from my body it is happening symptom first what is going on?” and I was told I was just suffering from anxiety and was not actually self aware enough to be making that call, my head and body were tricking me. I didn’t really think it was true but I am really used to being brushed off by doctors so I sort of went with it. But those sensations make me anxious through association with anxiety and make me feel like maybe something is horribly wrong with me and doctors are ignoring it because anxiety is such an easy diagnosis (especially once it’s already in your records). Since being diagnosed with hEDS this yearI suspect it is POTS or something because I have a lot of symptoms and I am currently awaiting referrals so we shall see! [info] hEDS [info] 1571647708

cant-fall-asleep-247 [info] Finally cried to my mom, felt nice I've been having a rough week. Ever since I stopped drinking, I've been feeling incredibly intense emotions, mainly sadness. I'm diagnosed with anxiety (both social and general) and I realized that my drinking was actually used as a crutch. I ended up having an anxiety attack during class this week, left early and cried in my car. I felt so overwhelmed. I have not had an anxiety attack for a while. I felt that I couldn't handle anything. Coming home didn't make me feel better. I woke up this morning feeling so dejected. When my mom started to talk to me about my moving day (I'm moving to my college campus in a couple weeks), I rudely snapped at her. I then started to cry because I just felt so alone and helpless. I finally told her about my struggles and how I stopped drinking (which she was surprisingly proud of). The thing is that my mom and I were never that close. We always have had our differences. I never thought that I would be divulging things about myself to her nor cry to her. It felt really nice to be comforted. [info] 161 days [info] 1576136678

thechikinguy [info] Any solution for severe grinding/clenching beyond mouth guards? I've been aware of my teeth grinding/clenching for about six years now, and have been wearing a mouth guard at night off and on, consistently in the last year as I've noticed my gums are receding. I find myself clenching during the day, and though I try to catch myself, it happens often and subconsciously. Despite using a mouth guard, my gums have still been receding. At this point my teeth feel more sensitive and I'm worried I'm getting near the root/nerve. After tearing up a boil-at-home mouthguard with a six-month warranty in less than three weeks, I decided to make a doctor's appointment.I'm pretty wary of consulting a doctor on this; I mentioned this problem during my last physical, and the doctor only suggested tensing up all my face muscles regularly to relax them. My dentist offered to custom-fit a mouth guard, but it would cost more than $1,000, and I simply do not have that money. Now I have no dental plan, so I had to go to my family doctor.Already from the get-go, I got a bad vibe off the doctor. The nurse weighed me and asked about the problem and suggested a mouth guard. I told her I chewed the last one up, and explained how I've cut down on caffeine, changed pillows, tried to get more sleep, exercise more to try and reduce stress, do yoga weekly, everything. She just said "it looks like you're doing everything right!" laughed, and left.So then the doctor comes in with his laptop, barely looks in my mouth, and tells me I should get a mouth guard."You can get one at a sporting goods store," which seemed very suspect, as I imagine there's a difference between a mouth guard for grinding and a mouth guard for field hockey. When I told him I've been using mouth guards consistently, they're not working my gums are still receding, and I don't want to buy a new one every month for the rest of forever, he just said he'd call a dentist friend and call me the next day.He also asked if I've been diagnosed with anxiety. I haven't, but I'm a very anxious person. I fret about everything. But he just asked if my job was stressful, and I said no, and he dropped the subject.I've heard muscle relaxers are an option, and brought that up, but he gave me a very dubious look. I felt like a chump.So he's supposed to call me today and tell me what brand of mouth guard to buy as though that will solve this. Is there anything I should do? Should I be following this anxiety thing further? I'm super cautious with my insurance and don't know what I'm covered for; once I got charged $100 on top of a copay because I had to take my shirt off for the doctor to look at my bacne.

snowfarts [info] I had the exact same symptoms when I got diagnosed this year. I was honest with my doctor and told her I had tried adderall, and it worked well when I did. My therapist is also in the same office so it helped. I am diagnosed with anxiety as well, and we were all concerned it would worsen my anxiety. I told them that no matter what the outcome was, I didn’t want to try anxiety meds and I’m willing to risk my anxiety being worse. If I know what’s causing it, it’s typically not an issue anyway. My therapist also said it was worth a try because either my anxiety was caused by my ADD, or they were two different things. I’ve been on it for 3 or 4 months now and my life is completely changed for the better. My anxiety was 100% caused by my ADD. I don’t get overwhelmed with all of the shit I have to do, and I’m actually able to do it instead of procrastinate. My doctor keeps me on a low dose, and I no longer get the feeling you experience at first (at first I was sad but then realized I cannot want to feel that ‘high’ feeling). I just feel like a normal person, which is weird because I thought I felt like that before. Except before it felt like I was living life with clouds in my brain and eyes, making me sleepy and unable to care about anything. I also have insomnia and it hasn’t affected it, if it does your dose is too strong. For a while I could NOT sleep and surprise, it was because of my anxiety. My therapist told me I was so worried about my sleep I was making myself unable to do so. Now I just lay down and if I’m laying for a minute, I don’t care. I just lay there. I’ll take melatonin every once in a while.Sorry for this literal essay.. I still have add, its just managed. [info] None [info] 1566853854
Ukiyo-Ikigai [info] I quit my job.I worked at an education dept at the time so I had a job where I was looking after a team of 9 senior peoples diaries, booking meetings and organising 40 different courses all at once. I was dubbed as the 'headless chicken' by my department because I was running around everywhere. Obviously I was stressed being the only person doing this for my team. When I asked for support my team especially my manager became vindictive and started micromanaging me (to the point I had to tell them when I was going to the toilet - no joke). It was the straw that broke the camel's back. I quit my job and went to my doctor for some support because I didn't wanna go to work anymore, was crying every day and then some - I was diagnosed with anxiety and low mood and went to therapy for a period of time. Eventually I found a part time job that was less stressful and was luckily in a team that was so supportive, they were the best team I've had to date. However, I still deal with anxiety over how I was treated in my previous role but learnt coping techniques from therapy which helps me be calm and put things into perspective.

DeathZombi [info] I keep thinking I have brain cancer even though I'm also pretty sure it's anxiety I've been having ice pick headaches as of late. This already got the anxiety going about why it's hurting. I've also had trouble with my memory, though this only started soon after I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.The thing that sent me into total panic was when I was pouring milk in a jug into a glass cup. I went to put the milk jug away, but as I was about to open the refrigerator I snapped and realized that I was about to put the glass cup into the fridge, not the milk jug. It's probably because I was just kind of dazed and not paying attention, but now I'm totally convinced I have some sort of brain disease and that I'm slowly dying and doing nothing about it.

Bunny_Larvae [info] I feel overwhelmed I have had problems with anxiety for years but lately it’s crippling. I was diagnosed with anxiety years ago during my husband’s first tour in Iraq. Which is so absurd he was the one in actual danger but I fell apart. I was afraid to answer the phone, the door and eventually go outside. I got treatment and a puppy. It helped. Over the years I had bouts of anxiety again but never so overwhelming until now.  Three-ish years ago I had a son, he almost died when he was born. He’s everything you could want in a child; loving cheerful, and confident. I feel like my anxiety is going to ruin his life. I’ve started smoking again, I feel so much shame. I need to get him into school but the idea of leaving him with someone else makes me feel like I can’t breathe. We’ve had to move repeatedly over the last several years (multiple continents type moving) for my husbands work; I’ve lost my support system. I’m lonely and isolated and I don’t want that for my son.  I don’t want him to have a mother he’s ashamed of.  I don’t to be burden to my husband and I know I am. I can’t sleep at night, I’m tired and scared all the time lately.I need to do some things that scare me today.

Freshman50000 [info] I told my boyfriend Last night I finally told my boyfriend that I’m almost positive that I have OCD. I was diagnosed with anxiety and Tourette’s, but I’ve suspected for a while that I really have OCD. After research, reading (the book “because we are bad” by Lily Bailey is amazing) and combing through this subreddit, I’m sure, and looking at next steps. So last night, I finally told him. I told him that when I said I’m anxious, that’s not even the half of it. I tried to explain intrusive thoughts, which is hard because I wanted to get across to him how seriously they affect me, but I didn’t want to scare him- and I didn’t want to make them seem like normal intrusive thoughts that people without OCD have. I talked about how I worry all day that the gate is open and my dog is gone, or that when I don’t finish a conversation with “I love you” I see my parents getting hit by a car, and that I’m nauseous constantly worrying about this stuff and it never goes away. I was so scared, but when I explained it all...he hugged me 😊 He was so surprised, he kept saying “holy shit, no wonder you’re always so tired,” and hugging me and reassuring me that he understood and that he’s glad he finally gets it. We were a bit stoned so I really hope he remembers all of this today because it was an insanely good moment in a time where I haven’t had many 😊 [info] None [info] 1558207032
Younce-Davis [info] Oh gosh! I had that problem with some neighbors a few years ago. The guy would literally beat his wife on the front lawn! Luckily they moved. My neighbor is considered lower middle class— but it is full of retired folk and starter families. It’s not a friendly neighborhood since everyone is moving in and out constantly. I was raised by boomers— the pick yourself up by the bootstraps mentally is still very prevalent in my society. It’s not realistic. When I was diagnosed with anxiety and had to go on meds it shattered my parents world 😭. Luckily they are very understanding. I used to make morbid jokes out of situations. My bf is from the Philippines and over there, people who aren’t optimistic and see the joy in life usually lose hope and don’t make it. It’s a poor country so starvation is widespread. After I stopped making morbid jokes, I became more optimistic. That only happened a few months after meds though. It was a rough transition. It’s good your friends can read you well. Curious, are you a high school or college student? Or working? If you are an adult, that will probably open up more treatment options for you since you won’t need your parents permission to receive it. If you are an adult, that will also give you the possibility of moving out and into a better environment. Trade school, if you do not have the resources for college, can get you some very nice jobs— look at welding— salary of $100,000 USD. Edit: background info on me. Biomedical engineering student at a University. I live in a mixed cultural neighborhood. There are the conservative folk here and the more liberal. My family tends to be more conservative. I am more liberal/ moderate.  [info] None [info] 1554504669
rough_lovely [info] I have been using CBD for about a year. I was diagnosed with anxiety, panic attacks and major depressive disorder after my husband passed from brain cancer at a very young age. It has worked better for me than all of the prescribed pills combined. It gives me an overall sence of calm and I sleep immensely better, which allows my body to recover.  I am not longer taking my prescriptions and let me say..the fog has lifted and I am overall feeling like I can tackle (most) everyday. The only downfall seems to be the high price of the oil.

Last I checked this feeling didn't fit the palpitations description.Thank you in advance. [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1587578901

laurandisorder [info] I used to get this so badly as a child - starting very young and it lasted well into adulthood. As an adult I was diagnosed with anxiety, but this was a different sensation. An overwhelming urge to be with my cat (sorry parents), my things (books)’and in my room. It was a physical, gut wrenching pull for the familiar. I could only overcome it through distraction. Boy, did my folks get sick of picking me up early from sleepovers and camps! [info] None [info] 1514373802
aquaboyh20 [info] [this is Gus](https://i.imgur.com/vn6SkRI.jpg). He is a plott hound and was a rescue from a pit bull breading and fighting house. They pulled a few of his front teeth. So eating is a challenge and messy. He is the sweetest boy though. My kids climb all over him. Me 1 year old pulls all over his ears and lips. All he does is lick her face and walk away. He typically chooses which one of the older girls he wants to cuddle with at night.He became my ESA dog back in December when we rescued him, as I was diagnosed with anxiety and a few other things. He is about to go to training to be a service dog. He loves all people and he'd rather be with me than be home by himself. He loves to run in the open field behind our home and be a turd and jump the fence and run off for a few minutes, then come back proud of himself.Upon request I can upload more pictures. He's a very serious dog. Rarely smiles lol. Except when he's running off in a field or riding in the van [info] http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2B4KFFIWZZWC [info] 1550984241
tuxedolux [info] If it’s not absolutely something you have to take then you can ask them for other alternatives. I did this when I was diagnosed with anxiety and was immediately prescribed Xanax. However, In my opinion, therapy should be done in place of medication. Therapy gives you the tools to handle what’s causing the problems in your mental state. It can be scary to go that deep into yourself but once you learn to deal with things it gets better. If it’s too scary though there is also group therapy.

Or even things I'm not touching, I feel like I have to feel them or do something to get that feeling to stop. These have been present for the majority of my life and my dad has major ocd and anxiety.

OliveWildly [info] YTA. People are looking at her and making comments about her behavior -- not yours. It's easy to assume that people are judging you when you have anxiety (which it sounds like you have a dose of), but if she's the one creating sound and movement, they're not looking at you.I was diagnosed with anxiety several years ago, and I can see where your frustration would come from. Here's something that changed my entire outlook (from my therapist) *"People are inherently selfish."* We approach every situation thinking more about ourselves than about the people around us. So all of that embarrassing stuff? Most people don't even notice it because they're too busy thinking about themselves.She also pointed out that it's **instinct** to look at something/someone when they create movement or noise (e.g. walk into a room) but it doesn't mean anything. We do it because (even tho we've evolved) we are still hardwired to notice changes in our environment and check to see if we're still safe. So when you walk into a room and 20 heads turn to look... or when your GF starts dancing in the grocery store... they're just checking the change in environment. They don't care as much about what she's doing as you do.I'm calling YTA because your anxiety is YOURS to own and deal with. When you push her to alter her behavior to placate your anxiety, you are making HER deal with your anxiety. Recognize that it's yours to learn how to manage. It's okay! There are plenty of us out here still figuring it out. [info] None [info] 1558476318

I've been diagnosed with anxiety every doc I've been to, with off the chart scores of anxiety and have never understood why, I never "feel" anxiety and I have an unusually low BPM (45-55)One of my doctors theorised it's because I've spent so long in a highly volatile environment growing up that having constant anxiety in the background has been essential for survival, but boyyyy is it useless when working in an office.

CandyceCox [info] I, too, became a "maniacal bitch" and was even diagnosed bi-polar 6 or 7 years into our marriage. I was diagnosed with anxiety and was on meds when we met....I wonder if I'll be off the bi-polar once he's no longer a part of my life....I was/am/always have been "the problem". If it were not for my fits of rage that are "abusive" and "psychologically damaging" to him and our children, he would be more attracted to me and want to have sex with me....at first I thought he could be right. After all, psychological disorders run in my family on both sides...well, same for him. I did scratch the shit out of his neck that one time and his co-worker and ex commented on it......in response to him breaking my pinkie. But what about when I pushed him?...oh yeah, I was trying to keep him from peeing on me.....the whole in the wall? Wait! That was him! I ducked in time. ....... He trained me to react with rage because I expected physical abuse from him. However, now he's made me look like the narcissist because he will remain calm or finally yell back once I've verbally hit below the belt. I shared all of it with my therapist and she is the one who pointed out that I respond/react to him in this manner as a defense as I autopilot my offense at the hint that a defense is needed. It's just so sick and fucked up. Now I'm "crazy". I'm the "narc" yada yada...this ALL a planned and strategic part of the narc's "grand cycle scheme". Now that I recognize it, he is having to push even harder to elicit a response out of me.....ugh! And more often than I like to admit, I engage but it's getting easier and easier to let it roll off because his mask will be torn off in court. ... You're not a narcissist! He wants you to think you are so he can play the victim. You're not the only one. [info] None [info] 1550496224

t4mmi [info] It’s different for everyone, and can manifest differently for individuals at different times so I can only tell you how I experience it. I am diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I am a rational person and I know my “concerns” are nonsense but something in the back of my mind just overrides all sense. I fret about everything and overanalyse situations thinking of every possible thing that might go wrong. “But what if...” is my brain’s absolute favourite. I catastrophise. Minor things feel much worse than they are. This all causes me to take extreme and irrational precautions against unrealistic threats as well as to avoid ...  a lot.As far as panic attacks... For me, sometimes I feel like I need to hide (at times I literally have) for no good reason or escape. Sometimes I am paralysed with it and just freeze. I cry. Sometimes I have difficulty breathing, my heart races, I have excruciating pain in different parts of my body (usually my neck), pressure in my head, sometimes dizziness. Basically all the things you might imagine being an appropriate reaction to immediate extreme danger with either minimal or no stimulus to justify it. See a therapist, it helps. ETA see a therapist sooner rather than later, I know the money and time is an issue but it is really, really important. I wish I had addressed my anxiety sooner, not doing so led me to habits and thought patterns that made it much worse.  [info] None [info] 1543285006
ODB247 [info] Female. The doc was male. It’s pretty typical for me to be diagnosed as having anxiety first and then I have to convince the doctor to test me for things. I was diagnosed with anxiety but it turned out to be cardiac issues -occasional arrhythmias. Same diagnosis when I lost my period for 9 months and then had bleeding for 6 months straight. That turned out to be a polyp. Same when I had insane dizziness for a few years. That one was actually a Chiari malformation. I don’t make up symptoms and I don’t present as panicking or looking for medication. I just want to know what is going on. I’m not sure if my symptoms are ignored because I’m female, because I look healthy, or maybe because the doctors are all just overworked snd pressed for time. It’s really frustrating. I rarely go to the doctor for anything because it sucks to be dismissed and told I’m making it up when I know something is wrong.  [info] None [info] 1536801216
srqnewbie [info] Agree!  My only documentation for my anxiety was the doctor visit recaps for the past 5 years (they pulled it up for me at the doc office, no appointment necessary) that basically just state your vitals and any meds you're on.  Nothing I gave DocMJ stated WHY or WHEN I was diagnosed with anxiety, just that my doc was continuing the anxiety med prescription I've been on forever.  I saw Dr. Glider at DocMJ in Bradenton and was in and out in 2 hot seconds.  Good luck and I agree that their refund policy is the only way to go on the off chance that you don't get approved.

DavidSmithies [info] Does anyone else not quite believe its anxiety? So, I've been diagnosed with anxiety. Specifically health anxiety. I've had it for 21 years now, since I was 15.It changes over time. I've gone from being scared of being sick in front of people, to thinking I had bowel cancer to heart attacks, to obviously, now Covid and specifically having breathing problems. I know I'm a naturally anxious person, and always think I'm ill.But there's an odd thing I struggle with. Like I said, I know I'm a naturally anxious person but I have a hard time accepting that all my problems are down to anxiety.I don't get panic attacks. I don't hyperventilate. I'm quite a confident person at work. I can give speeches. I'm not scared of large groups. I don't shake, go pale or faint. I don't have OCD, or come across as a worrier, to other people.I guess I'm not a stereotypical anxiety sufferer.My symptoms are also subtle, and they change daily. One day I could have chest tightness, the next I'll have sweats and shivers. I don't have a known trigger. It can literally come out of nowhere, for no apparent reason.It makes me think that the symptoms must be because of a genuine physical reason. The doctors have checked me and can't find anything.I guess, in summary, my biggest struggle is - how can this be anxiety when I get random symptoms at times of low anxiety!!Does anyone else have trouble identifying a trigger, or have problems fully accepting it is anxiety?

HellaUwU [info] Heart palpitations after exercising on 0 calorie intake for 2 days? Hi there, 19F, 100kg, non smoker, non drinker, only medications I take are inhalers for asthma.Hi there, I've eaten absolutely nothing for the past 2 days, I've only drank fizzy flavoured water. After doing some very mild exercise (40 squats and 30 sit ups) I started to get really bad heart palpitations, it lasted for about 3 minutes and then calmed down. I have had palpitations before as I'm diagnosed with anxiety. Is me being overweight having too much strain on my heart? Will this go away when I lose weight? Should I just power through the palpitations? Should I wait until the palpitations pass then carry on? Do I need to stop altogether?Just to be clear, I am aware that eating nothing for days at a time isnt great, but I am currently in a position where I can't eat.

BlackOmegaPsi [info] Found myself in a career trap I landed myself in a really shitty spot concerning my career, so this is going to be long post.&amp;#x200B;I’ve had a successful journalism/PR career of over 10 years. Started as a journalist, then an editor, then transferred to working as a press relations officer in a large IT company, where I’ve worked for almost 5 years. I was in charge of all press-related communications, did some branding work, a lot of copywriting. I had a great boss, and was the public figure of my company. We had free gym, the commuting was nice, and I had friend there.The only downsides - no room for promotion, and the pay could’ve been better. I’ve a small credit, but it still entails monthly payments. In November, I was approached by another IT company with an offer of almost 2 times my salary at the last place and the position of a PR Director. I was to manage all of the company’s PR as a lead. This other company belongs to a much more prestigious holding than my last one, I was promised interesting press and brand strategy projects, so, with a heavy heart, I took the offer.See, my mother is battling a serious illness, and even though me and my family (father and mother) are financially independent, I figured it’d be better if I had additional security just in case. Well, the job turned nothing like was promised. I’m not a lead - there’s no PR team, and the tasks are on a level, if not lower, as with on my previous place. I’ve risen the question of the team, and I was met with a resounding “no, we don’t have the capacity”. The worst part, is that this company’s PR slant is in a whole other direction - instead of press/branding, the company is focused on events and HR-related communications. I’m forced to do the full-spectrum work of a whole PR AND event-management department. I have to do a shitload of buying and coordinating purchases, something that was below my position and pay-grade at the other job.Ergo, there’s an overwhelming amount of entry-level, menial stuff, instead of the promised lead and creativity. My boss is chaotic, heaping an inordinate amount of tasks, forgetting to set deadlines for half of them, then demands accountability.The cherry on top? In 2011 I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, was successfully medicated. The next bout of the anxiety happened in 2015, that too, was successfully dealt with. I feel like the illness is returning - the combination of a lot of stress, surgery in late 2018, my mother’s problems, house renovations, etc, coming to all of this.Now, I feel horrible. I hate not only this new job and feel like it’s a mistake (I cry every day before and after work), I hate my career prospects and the whole profession as a whole. The mere thought of doing what I do makes me physically sick (I even had full-blown nausea and vomit over it). Even thinking that I somehow change and apply to a new, but similar job, gives me the same awful response. I dread every day, and what’s worse, I’m saddled with a huge amount of guilt:\- my parents were very happy with my new job. I’ve tried to talk to them about my feelings, and well, it amounted to “suck it up, everyone has to deal with not liking their job. What can you do other than PR for a respectable pay and your credit obligations? Nothing”.\- being unhappy about my career makes my sick mother unhappy as well, and I don’t want to contribute to any possible negativity my situation brings to here health.In 1 month my probation ends, and I almost want to fail. Sure it could hurt my reputation on the market, but thing is, I don’t want to do this anymore. I feel utterly trapped. [info] None [info] 1579499762

Mephistophellatio [info] Man, I can relate to this so well.  I'm at the very beginning steps of trying to build a reputation for myself in the art community.  As I eventually would like to be able to support myself with artwork.  No plans for anything extravagant, just want to pay the bills with it.  I'd like to think that having three bachelors degrees in various fine-art related subjects shows that I'm not a slacker, and that I'm both talented enough and capable enough to use my art to achieve something.  Even if that's just being able to pay my bills with it.The issue is that I have a full time job now.  And I love it.  Been with the company for almost three years, wonderful benefits, love the people I work with.  But it's like 50-60 hours of my week most of the time, accounting for commute and everything.  And the job itself is really fun, but I've found that I think it's fun because it uses the same...energy? that I use when I'm being creative.  But I don't get the same reward/satisfaction mentally from working as I do from finishing a piece.  So when I get home each night, or on a rare day off, I'm just mentally exhausted, and given that I average 6-8 miles of movement every day also pretty tired physically.  So there's so much desire to work on something productive.  To draw or paint or render something.  I want to do it so badly.  But when the time comes, I just feel like my brain is recharging from work and I have zero motivation or inspiration to complete anything useful.  So I do spend the sparse free time I have getting high and watching Netflix or playing video games.  It's frustrating.  Because ostensibly the answer is "Just stop doing what you're doing and do the other thing" but it isn't that simple.I don't know, maybe it's because I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depressive disorders so my wiring just isn't up to spec or something.  But even with medications, I haven't noticed much of a difference in how exhausted I am after work, or how much spare creative energy I have.And I would love to even just take fewer hours at work and have the spare time to work on personal stuff.  But I can barely make ends meet as is, so making less money and losing part of my benefits isn't an option, at least not until I'm making enough money from art to supplement the lost hours.  But you have to build that kind of clout.  And since for much of the past three years I've been producing a whopping 0 pieces a month, I'm obviously not going anywhere with that just yet.So I feel like it's a weird catch-22.  Like I can either lose the money for a while and not be able to pay my bills until I start making more money on my own.  Or I can give up on the dream that I've had since I was 8 and take a more lucrative, but entirely inflexible, position at my current employer.I don't know.  I'm sure that a comment on a 5 hour old r/quotesporn isn't the best place for me to vent about this, but whatever, it just struck me.If you've read this much, [here's a treat for you](https://www.instagram.com/snoopybabe/?hl=en) [info] None [info] 1471809696
hellohealthyliving_ [info] I've officially been un-diagnosed with binge eating disorder. My therapist told me my eating habits no longer qualify me as a binge eater and that I now fall into a "chronic overeater" category due to anxiety. Instead of working on improving my binges (which aren't binges anymore!), we're working on ways to better manage my anxiety so that the overeating happens less frequently (about once a week right now). I broke down in tears in her office yesterday, it just felt so liberating to officially be "cleared" from being a binge eater. Her and I agree, the switch to Keto played a huge part in the whole thing because I am no longer eating the foods that would have originally triggered me to binge.I thought this was something I would have to deal with for the rest of my life, but I feel as if I'm finally free of my emotional tie to food. (Edit: I worded this poorly. What I meant was having someone tell me that my eating habits no longer qualified me as someone who suffered from binge eating disorder made me feel free from the Black Cloud that is BED and has been hovering over my head for quite some time. I would feel guilty every time I took an extra spoonful of peanut butter out of the jar and ate it and every time I had a piece of candy because the BED that had consumed my life for so long told me that if I ate that stuff, it was bad and I was bad. My therapist broke down my last several “binges” and what I ate and she said to me “Just because you eat more than you should sometimes doesn’t qualify you as a binge eater anymore.” So to me, that is emotional freedom not from the food, but from the BED.)***EDIT: For those of you asking, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/86smg6/ive_officially_been_undiagnosed_with_binge_eating/dw7w6zt/) is the eating habits I was dealing with that originally got me my BED diagnosis. My most recent overeating sessions have stayed well under 4,000 calories at their worst (but that is absolute worst, usually now it's like eating a total of 2,000 calories in a day). No, I'm not diagnosed with "overeating while stressed" I'm diagnosed with anxiety right now and we are hoping to resolve it without any medication. Everyone copes with anxiety different. Some people don't sleep, some have panic attacks, some physically harm themselves, I overeat and by treating my anxiety and finding ways for me to cope with it, it should help reduce the amount of overeating that I do.I also noticed a lot of people writing and saying that it's something that they're struggling with as well, I'd just like to put out there that my therapist gave me [this](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/the-dialectical-behavior-therapy-skills-workbook-matthew-mckay/1008150072/2679449628496?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_DRS_New+Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&amp;2sid=Google_&amp;sourceId=PLGoP164997&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7tfVBRB0EiwAiSYGM6R-ME0VJ6Cd3vdgcVjroPeAmVXp6uA_joAfbsecLtRXqA8s5KIv3xoCi18QAvD_BwE) book and we have been working through it and talking about different coping mechanisms together to help me to regulate and better handle the overwhelming emotions I deal with when anxiety strikes that is not overeating.

ElenyaRevons [info] I’m always sick and I don’t know why. I am 22F. I am constantly getting sick. Like, if there’s a bug going around, I get it. If I get sick or even get allergies, I get a sinus infection. It’s affecting my relationships, my job (obviously), and I’m just really tired of being “that girl.” I eat pretty healthy, try to avoid sugar, I don’t do drugs or smoke, I don’t go to the gym but I’m pretty active in general, I’m a healthy weight (5,4”, 130lbs) I drink a lot of water. I take vitamin d, iron, and Zoloft. I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and ADHD.I’ve been to an allergist since I was very little (born early, asthma, mild allergies) and he just put me on Flonase to see if the sinus infections would stop. I had my adenoids removed when I was four because I was always sick, and until later in high school it wasn’t this bad. Anyway, I’m just really tired of this. I know I’m on thin ice with my boss because I’m frequently sick with fevers and symptoms that render me unable to work. Any advice or thoughts? [info] This user has not yet been verified.

Oniguri [info] What? It's not subjective, I have cysts scans from before my diet and a year after and the cysts on my ovaries are literally gone. It's insulin related so being ketogenic stops the progression, but carnivore put it into remission. I was diagnosed with anxiety by a practitioner, I'm not self-diagnosed, I know what it felt like and the fact you're telling me 'it's denial' shows a significant lack of empathy and bias on your side.Why are you so against people getting better? Who cares how it's done, lets just acknowledge something positive is happening and try and understand the mechanism. Maybe I'll die of CVD in 20 years, who knows? But at the moment I feel better than I ever have in my life and my mental clarity is something I thought I'd never achieve.Science is about seeking truth not your predisposed dogmas.  Also, what you don't seem to understand, I didn't do this diet first. This was literally my LAST course of action after trying every single diet that was supposed to improve symptoms, none of them helped. I didn't wake up one day and decide to eat lamb fat and rare liver lol, it was slow progression and following the things that made me feel good and lessened my symptoms. Digestion being the most impactful. [info] None [info] 1561388123
666bich [info] Hey, this is long... Just to warn. But if you don't want to read the whole things... Shut gets better but you have to let it get better and work at it to make it better. 'It' being whatever it is that's tying you down. So, first of [TRIGGER WARNING] this involves my sexual abuse as a child and how it affected and still affects my life.I was a happy kid. I wasn't perfect, my family weren't perfect. We were kinda poor, always struggled for food and to pay the bills. I never went on school trips and I always had holes in my clothes. I was picked on for being weird, having glasses and all round just not fitting in. However, this never really bothered me. I had my own fun and my own friends who liked me and a family who, dispute their troubles, loved me. And this part come in handy later on. I was eight when I was sexually abused and almost raped. It was by a family friends son who was 17 at the time. I trusted him. And his brother. I don't want to go into details because it still hurts to talk about but I shouls have spoken about it when it happened. He touched me (a girl) and hurt me and made my whole life begin to spiral out of control. I didn't speak to the police. They came to my house but I couldn't speak to them. I was ashamed and embarrassed and scared. They sent two male officers and I didn't even want to sit next to them. I started self harming almost instantly. I started having panic attack that got worse and worse. I was diagnosed with anxiety at ten. I felt so disconnected. I was at an age where I needed to be able to talk and share my feelings but, I couldn't, I didn't know how. By 11 I was acting out daily. I needed a way to get these emotions out of me. I got into fights at school. I caught with my parents and my siblings. I even tried smoking because I thought it'd make me look cool and I thought people would like me. When I was 12 my parents broke up. And I had been suffering a lot of the arguments and lashouts they were having. My self harm was daily by this point and somehow, nobody knew. Nobody asked. The cuts didn't really leave scars because I was just using sharp plastic or wire, things I could easily access. So nobody could even tell I was hurting myself. Thirteen to 16 were really, really hard. By now I was constantly hurting myself. Skipping school. I was sexually harassed by a boy from school and then again, forced against my will do give him oral sex. At the age of 14. And then things started going around school. I was a slag, a white, I was asking for it. People even found out about what happened when I was a kid and it tore me apart. Home life was horrible. School life was horrible. I had no friends, nobody to talk to. So when I was 16 I tried to hang myself. Again the details are hard to talk about. My sister saved my life and she never told anyone but she forever me to go to therapy. I did for about six weeks, then I started lying to her. I wasn't going anymore. I fell into a bad crowd with some even worse people who showed me drugs and alcohol and that giving a fuck was for idiots and people who had reason to. They were not my friends but they took my mind off of things. I started sleeping around, stealing, fighting... Again. But I liked it. I was happy for a while. I started dating a 19 year old (I was 16) and I thought he was the love of my life. I think I was addicted to MDMA at this time. The way it made me feel was amazing and I didn't have a comedown the next day. Oddly I was actually going to school. In my final year. Constantly smoking weed or high on MD. In school... I was an idiot. But I got my GCSEs. All but my maths and history. I decided I was going to fail them anyway so I studied harder on everything else and got mostly B's and A's. I was proud of myself for once. That happiness and that pried was quickly torn away though. My dad wasn't overly upset when he found out about my grades but he was fuming when he found out about my boyfriend and what we had been doing together. And all of this happened on the day of my final exam. For some stupid reason, after like six months of not hurting myself. That night I cut myself. And I didn't even intend for this to happen but, it did. I bled for an hour straight, no stoppage. I was using my bed sheets as a bandage and the blood had soaked them through. I stumbled down stairs and fell into a bookshelf. My dad rushed over to me. Asked me where I had cut myself, called my mum, called an ambulance and that's all I remember. I woke up in hospital that night and I just cried and cried and apologized to everyone. Even my nurses. This now meant that I was gonna be forced to get better. And I was glad. I kinda had that attention that I needed now. And no this isn't attention seeking. Well it is. But not how you know it to be. I wasn't doing these things for attention. I was doing them for help. And this was the help I needed. The months after were horrible. My "boyfriend" left me and my "friends" didn't even text me a get well soon. I was alone again. And I was in and out of hospital constantly. If not for check ups it was because I had hurt myself. If not that it was because I was under weight. If not that then something else. My therapists were shit. But two of them were amazing. They actually cared. And it was one on them who made me realise something. And don't get me wrong I was 18 when I realised this. That was like two and a half years of therapy and constant eyes watching me. He reminded me of something I told him in the begining. Something I said at the begining of this story. When I was a kid I was strong. Things were tough and things were shitty but I knew that people around me loved me and cared about me. And for so many years I had forgotten that. I didn't realise that what I was doing was hurting my family. Well I did but I guess I didn't care. I realised that maybe I had been selfish all those years. And maybe my fear had turned me into this defensive horrible person that could never see the light at the end of the tunnel. He told me things might not get better but they will even out. And he was right. Things were and are still hard and I still think about killing myself when things have been too much to handle. I haven't hurt myself in almost a year. I've spoken about my problems and I've helped others who have felt the same. I've been into schools and spoken to young girls (and the boys who wanted to be there) about rape and sexual abuse and where to go and who to talk to. I know that what happened to me wasn't my fault and I know now that punishing myself will never stop the cycle. Just make it stronger and harder to break. I live with my fiancé, he knows everything and he loves me all the same. And I only present myself to people who love me for who I am... Warts and all! Oh and my parents went on a date last month... That made me real happy. They still aren't together but they changed as people, for the better, and anyone else who is struggling can also change for the better. Not to be cringe but recovery starts with you. You have to accept help, ask for help, help others, do what makes you feel good!!! [info] None [info] 1568723000
Rhaski [info] I hope I can help you a little here. Your experience sounds almost identical to my first year, and even now in my second year those feelings have come and gone. I discovered that the issue is not the career, or my ability to do the job, rather, it was more to do with how I deal with stress and my unrealistic expectations of myself. I ended seeing a therapist. I was diagnosed with anxiety, which is something I am now working on and making a lot of progress with managing stress. I would recommend is seeing a therapist about what you're feeling. Stress is part of the job, but it isn't normal to feel dread, fear and panic. This doesn't necessarily mean you also have anxiety, but it's clear that something is not right in the way you handle stress. You have worked hard to academically and professionally prepare yourself for this career so don't pull the trigger on leaving it behind too readily, give yourself a real chance first. Seek advice and tips from colleagues, mentors, etc as much as you can. Learn from them, find out how they deal with everything (I guarantee it doesn't involve them getting through every bit of work all the time). But seriously, book yourself in too see someone about how to handle your stress levels, and give yourself some credit. This is not an easy job,   it if you stick with it, it WILL get easier as you learn the tricks and everything stops being so new. In the meantime, acknowledge the progress that you HAVE made, and stop being so hard on yourself for not being a veteran in your first year [info] None [info] 1512435908
curiouscat1092 [info] I set up my first appointment with a therapist! For context, I'm a twenty-six year old young woman living in Upstate NY. I was diagnosed with anxiety and borderline personality disorder when I was twenty-two. I got out of a three-ish year long abusive relationship almost three years ago and have been rebuilding my life ever since. I spent almost a year single. Got a new job. Paid down debts. Spent time practicing self care.In February of '17, I met a wonderful young man who decided to join me on this journey we called life. We've been through A LOT together in these two plus years: his dad had two heart attacks, his mom has a history of breast cancer and has had other complications as a result. His little sister has had multiple dance related injuries. My grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer. My brother underwent bariatric surgery. I say all this because the other day, I realized how stressed I've become. I realize that for the sake of my sanity and the health of my relationship, I need a healthy outlet to process my feelings. A place to go to work through my ish. So, I put together a list of therapists in my area, talked with my insurance, sent some emails, and waited. As luck would have it, there is a therapist who's practice is nearby me. So, we've tentatively scheduled a first session for a week from today!&amp;#x200B;Is there anyone else who, like me, took a look at their life and said, "Woah. I'm going to need get some help and get myself in order!"? (I mean, I know there are, it would just be nice to not feel so alone.) Besides seeking professional help, what else did you do to take care of your mental health and well-being? [info] None [info] 1559745308

mikachuu [info] This all sounds like really wonderful advice.  I just don't know if I'm able to do it.  I'm in my (technically) last year of college, and I'm the biggest procrastinator.  I've not been diagnosed with ADHD, but I do feel like so many of my thoughts/actions are out of control, even though I seem very calm on the outside.  I have been diagnosed with anxiety big time, but basically my GPA is a 2.3 and I don't think I have enough time to even raise it up over a 3.0.  I feel like I'm too far gone, and it's definitely the electronics.  I'm surrounded by them.  Like you said, they can eat up hours at a time and you don't even notice until it's too late.  With me, I do notice and I mess around on my laptop or phone anyway.  So it all comes down to willpower, which I don't have any left.  The only way I've made it this far is by forcing myself to wait until the last minute and then cramming everything in while I'm at school.  That needs to stop ASAP, but I just can't break the cycle.  Sorry for rambling, but your post just really made me think about where I am in actuality, not where everyone thinks I am.  I tell people all the time that I'm just a fraud, but they laugh it off.  They don't know how difficult it is... or maybe they do and don't believe me.  Either way, I know I need help and there's too much standing in my way to even start.   [info] None [info] 1396268185
Karmagirl1 [info] You’re an amazing parent, screw the hatersMine are 5 and 7 and I call those days mental health days. Sometimes kids, like adults need a day to recollect themselves and especially if the day prior was a bad stressful day for them. My mom forced me to go when when I was diagnosed with anxiety. I don’t remember learning anything those days just remember the torment of having to be there. I promised I’d be kinder to my own children.

I still clench my pelvic floor sometimes during times of high stress (&amp; I am diagnosed with anxiety as well), but I’m able to notice that it’s happening and try to implement skills and therapies to relax it again (and to also try to de-escalate the anxiety in general).

pobalita [info] Was this a panic attack or did someone drug me? TLDR:  Ended up in the ER last weekend.  Not sure if it was a panic attack or something put something in my drink.&amp;#x200B;Background:I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder about 30 years ago following the death of a parent.  I have minor and manageble panic attacks which happen maybe once or twice a month.  Most of them are caused by something obvious; however, sometimes they come out of nowhere.   I take a few xanax per month as needed.  I've been on longer-term meds a few times in the past 30 years when anxiety is super high (divorce, family death, job changes...big stuff) and causes 4 or 5 panic attacks per day.  I'm not on meds now and have not had any panic attack other than the one discussed below in around a month.  My panic attacks are always pretty much the same - a blast of adrenaline and then crying for a few minutes as the feeling subsides.&amp;#x200B;The story:Last week SO and I went to a bar.  I ordered 2 martinis over the course of about 4 hours.  After about half of the second drink, I went to use the restroom and on the way back everything around me started spinning.  I became very disoriented and had a hard time making it back to the bar.  When I got there, I put my head on SO's shoulder and I noticed that I was mildly hyperventilating.  SO asked me what was wrong and I couldn't answer.  I threw up in an ice bucket and when I tried to sit up, I passed out.&amp;#x200B;SO took me to the lobby where I kept blacking out over and over and had a very hard time breathing.  I felt like I didn't want to breathe and every inhalation was an effort.  I remember thinking that I was most definitely dying.  When emergency help came, I could hear them ask the bartender if anyone had tampered with my drink and asking SO if I'd taken any drugs before taking me to the ER.  All vitals good, blood sugar fine. I threw up again in the ER.  They didn't do much after they found out that I have anxiety disorder other than let me rest.  I fell asleep for a little bit and when I woke up, I had what I would consider a very typical and recognizable panic attack.  I was given a valium for it and discharged shortly after.  My release papers said that I'd been brought in for a panic attack.&amp;#x200B;Does what happened to me in the bar sound like a panic attack??  I had only 1.5 drinks which should not cause me to throw up or pass out from drunkeness.  In fact, I felt fine until I tried to return from the restroom and became disoriented.   I am wondering if it's more likely that someone put something in my second drink?  Something wierd did happen: when I started feeling disoriented, the stranger sitting next to me (we'd been talking him for a while) asked for the rest of my drink and took it.  I don't know if he drank it.  Who asks for the rest of a strangers' drink at a bar?&amp;#x200B;While I don't want to believe that I was drugged, I'm even more afraid to believe that was a panic attack because it was really scary and I don't ever want it to happen again.  No panic attack has ever left me disoriented or vomiting or passing out.  Not ever.  Also, this was absolutely out of the blue - nothing had upset me or scared me.  In fact, we had been having a really fun evening.  Nothing about it was familiar: no adrenaline, no shaking, no crying.  Just fading to black and back.  No panic attacks since the ER visit either.&amp;#x200B;Has anyone else had a panic attack remotely like this before or does it sound like something else?  I'm not sure how to cope with the feeling that this could randomly happen to me again.  Any advice appreciated.&amp;#x200B;edited to add:  the period of time that I was blacking out and vomiting was about 3 hours. [info] None [info] 1550105174
ChocolateFixesAll [info] \*hugs if you want them\* I can totally see how that image would set you off. A good mom wouldn't rely on a stupid meme to "apologize" for making mistakes. She'd be in front of you, doing it for real and trying to actively change to make things better. &amp;#x200B;Are moms going to make mistakes? Yup. Do real moms feel guilt for that and try to do better? AbsoFUCKinglutely. My kids are 8 and 12 and I apologize to them when I make mistakes or when I mess something up. I am diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and it's been a rollercoaster. I hate that my kids are having to see me struggle with this and that my anxiety messes things up for them sometimes. Having your 12yr old daughter find you in the kitchen in the middle of a panic attack is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to me and yo know what she did? She put her arms around me and hugged me until the attack was over. That's not something I ever wanted my daughter to have to do,but she did and I apologized to her for it and I apologized for how messed up I've been and that I've been trying to do better. She told me she could tell.&amp;#x200B;If your mom had ever apologized and worked on fixing things, things would be different. But she didn't. So I am here to tell you that you are NOT worthless. You are a wonderful person who deserves to be happy. You are worthy of being cared and loved and I, an internet stranger, care about you.

FrankieJoe15 [info] Experiences with psychological assessment? Hi everyone! First time posting so a little bit nervous. I’m based in the UK so I’m aware some information may be a little bit different from other places.Basically, I have struggled with my mental health for a long time, some pretty traumatic things have happened to me and I’m basically fighting everyday to keep strong for my daughter. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 12 and PTSD after my daughters birth in 2014, I wasn’t actually offered any help for these things other than pills that I never really took. I referred myself to the NHS Well-being service where you can refer yourself for psychological help. I have my first appointment in the morning and the letter states it will be a psychological assessment. I’m a little bit unsure of what to expect and would like some advice/experiences of what other people have had! I’m also very proud of myself for finally speaking out and admitting I might need a little bit of help, I want to be the very best version of myself for my little girl, I don’t want her to grow up like I did. Thank you for reading and any advice you may be able to offer. Best wishes guys! [info] None [info] 1537723926
Aloha456 [info] How I realised my own nmum was a narcissist. I'm on mobile so formatting might be slightly off I guess.I'm 17 and currently still living with my nmum. I've been aware of her being an N for around two years. The thing that really kicked it off was when my brother a year younger than me kinda broke from her tactics and ruined his life. He was a 14 year old kid smoking weed and not coming home at night. We never knew where he was, and our nmum roped me into helping her, he ended up hating me after it. During that time I realised that some of the things she was doing to try and keep him under her were a little extreme. She began getting the police to escort him around, she tried keeping him locked in our room (at the time I shared with him and one of our other younger brothers.) Eventually, he moved out to live with my dad and I thought that that part of my life was over and we'd go back to being a happy family or whatever.Of course, we didn't. Things got really difficult for me mentally and I couldn't keep up. I was aware of everything she was doing to me now and it hurt. The pressure of it caused me to break and I stopped going to school a lot. The previous year I'd missed a lot of school because I'd had a really bad bout with my asthma, so that year I'd pretended it had surfaced again because I was struggling to do anything that required any energy. Of course it didn't stop her, she'd still make me do everything for her. Clean the house, pick up my younger siblings from school, look after the siblings, put them to bed. And then she'd yell at me for never helping her, for being useless and not doing anything ever. The most fucked up part was I kept telling her that I loved her.What drove me to realise she was an N was that because I was aware of her shitty behaviour and suffering from it, I vented to my friends when I felt like I couldn't hold it in. First time I did, one of them immediately said that it was abuse and neglect that she was doing. I didn't believe her and began making excuses for my N. I said that my brother had broke her (funny, isn't it?), that she was still suffering from the death of my nana/her mum, that she was really a good person going through a bad time. This spell of me thinking that she used to be a good person didn't break for a long time, but me believing that she would get better did after my suicide attempt in march of last year.I'm keeping this part brief because I don't like talking about this. Last year everything got too much and I attempted suicide. Obviously, I survived and my nmum knew about my attempt. She took me to the gp who referred me to therapist. She made sure I went to the first appointment which is where I was diagnosed with anxiety. I thought originally that this had jolted my nmum into going back to the nice caring person I thought she was. I was wrong, she refused to take me to any of the follow up appointments. There was always an excuse, she needed a nap, I had to pick the kids up from school etc. The excuse that made me realise was when she chose a day trip to the seaside where my brother now lives over my appointment. I knew then that it wasn't getting any better.It wasn't until last September when I realised it had been abuse my entire life. I'd been in college for about a week or two at this point and we got into a particularly nasty argument. Me, my elder sister and my mum. I don't specifically remember why, we have so many that they often blur into one but this particular fight was one that made me and my sister say to each other that we never wanted to go back. We talked a lot around this time, and I mentioned my ideology of her going back to how she used to be. That's when my sister told me that she was never like that, I had just been manipulated into thinking that she was. I'd been the most open to this manipulation because I was the most dependent on her. I have autism, dyspraxia and asthma, I spent a lot of time as a kid in the hospital or needing help with school or every day things. When she stopped me from seeing my dad all the time it was for my health. When I wasn't allowed out with friends it was because my autism made it dangerous for me to be out without supervision. She made me think my dad had been abusive to her and that was why they split up. She told me worse things about my dad that I'm not going to say here in risk of trigger warnings.I'm going to tell you two stories. One is my memory of what happened, one is what actually happened. First, the memory.This one happened when I was around ten. My dad often picked us up from school and he would take us out for dinner and spend time with us. This particular day, my nmum was out with my younger siblings and told my dad that he was allowed to take us back to the house. She had given my sister the spare key for the day to let us in. For dinner that day my dad bought us pizza, but instead of anything big we got a ten inch pizza to share between the 3 of us. That's not a big pizza to start with, but between three kids it becomes even smaller. We were starving that day, and when my mum got back later all the other kids had been fed pretty well and she said that because it was late and we didn't have any food in she couldn't do anything for us. This was my dad's fault for being a cheapskate and not letting us eat anything big. What actually happened isn't too different except for one big thing: she told my dad to not buy us dinner at all because she woulf feed us when she got back. He still got us a little something to eat for a snack regardless when her intent had been to starve us so she could manipulate us into hating him.That's the sort of things I figured out that day, and it's when I made the decision to live at my dad's half time when not in college and on weekends.The point of this rant is that some days I still begin to believe she never did anything wrong and I needed to relive all of this to bring myself back to reality. She doesn't love me, she never did and never will. The things here don't even scratch the surface of what she did and still does but it was all that I needed to force myself to stop being a dipshit and reliving the time I thought she was a good person. Sorry if the post is a bit of a mess, as far as timelines go it isn't the neatest [info] None [info] 1560347221

NYCParis7 [info] Hi I've been through the same. Just a quick intro, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder when I was 16. I stayed home a lot, had 0 friends and felt unhappy and low all the time. And yes I totally understand how you are feeling now. First off, try considering medication for your anxiety. Because for me, my doctor told me that I have too much receptor cell in one of the parts of my brain, so I get super anxious over even the small stuff. So yea, the medication can calm you down and help u in your work and daily life.Next, your living situation. It seems to bother u a lot. So, start to work on it. Try to post more ads online on local forums, Craigslist, uni forum, etc. Maybe work extra hours or get an extra job. Further to that, start saving up. Yes I know u barely have enough to live by now, but just make sacrifices and save up a little every month. Why? For college/ emergency. It's already a good start that you want to go to college. 😃👍🏻 I know people say that degree is not the only way, but in many times, degree is the easier and safer way. Next, your job. But first let me tell you about my fear which caused my OCD, anxiety and agoraphobia. I was afraid of using the public bathroom. I fear people will judge me for doing number 2. I fear people will think that I'm abnormal and dirty. My main problem was MY FEAR OF HOW PEOPLE WILL THINK OF ME. In short, I gave too much sh** (lol nice pun). So yea bak to ur workplace, don't care so much. People do not think of u as much as u think they do, for real! Like kuroky said 'don't give a f**k!' If u really dislike ur existing job, it's time to look for a new one. Stay up, play less dota, and start looking for jobs. Try to attend as many interview as u can. You never know which job has the best opportunities for u until u get to compare them. Finally, I'm not sure if u have been through this. But for me, I do a lot of self-pity. I looked at my situation and started comparing myself against my friends who are doing better, then I start to feel very down and feel pitiful for myself. That same cycle happens so often, I didn't get to my problem and solve it, instead I was just there gloating and getting all sad about my problem. BUT I HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH AND OVER ALL THESE NOW. 7 years later, which is now, I'm 24, graduated, have a full time job, have a gf (which helped me alot in my shitty 😂 Problem). As my father always tells me, 'son, you just need a breakthrough, and things will change'. And it did! You can do it my friend, I wish u all the best. Nothing comes free in life. Treasure ur family members and friends. Help while you can, because u never know when u need the same. All the best, looking forward to seeing you overcome all these and make a post of your victorious breakthrough on DOTA 2 REDDIT. Best regards,Samuel.  [info]  [info] 1537316884
Fiyet [info] I would recommend it. I originally started stitching when I was 9 years old because my aunt would babysit me and she taught me how. I stopped stitching when I got a job when I was 16 and didn't take it back up until 2 years ago, when I was 30. I started stitching again after my brother-in-law died. He fell and it took 11 days for search and rescue to find his body. I was going crazy and my aunt, who I'm still very close to, overnighted me a kit. While I was still in a lot of pain keeping my hands and mind busy was very helpful. Cross stitching still helps me. I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and PTSD. So having something to focus on that keeps me busy but not too busy has been amazing for me. And when I'm done with a project I have a sense of accomplishment that makes me feel better about my life and my situation. Also they make great gifts and seeing someone get one of my cross stitches as a gift feels amazing because I'm lucky and my family appreciates the work behind the craft. What has also helped me was discovering the cross stitch community online. It is amazing! I've made some great friends through Facebook groups and Instagram. In fact one of my friends that I met through cross stitch literally lives down the street from me. it's fun to have in jokes with people about cross stitch and have people understand how it can get frustrating sometimes. There are a lot of great fun people and it elevated my craft from being fun to being part of my life. [info] None [info] 1540927510
swivel2369 [info] How do I know if my issue is anxiety or not? I've been to a couple doctors and told them I think I have anxiety bit they seem to think it's more of a small case of ocd instead. What medications would I be given if I was diagnosed with anxiety. Probably a mild case. I bite my nails constantly even while telling myself not to. I'm always driving myself crazy about being late to anywhere. Even if it doesnt matter what time I get there and I seem to have no patience at all. For anything. I always seem on edge. I can be in a great mood one minute and the second something goes wrong or didn't go exactly how I planned I'm almost in a rage. Internally anyway. Rarely do I ever explode by hitting something or throwing something but I get so tied up inside and get pissed sometimes in a split second. So I have anxiety or is it something else?

BCD195 [info] I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember and I can tell you this feels very similar to an anxiety attack (for me) but it feels slightly different, which makes me worry that it’s something worse. Last time something like this happened I stoped smoking for 2 months and it seemed to fix me but I don’t know what caused the issue to come back, or if this is even related to what I experienced about a year ago. Like I said it’s very similar but slightly different so I cannot tell if it’s related My best guess is the weed is making my anxiety get worse for some reason (or in your case, making it so you notice your anxiety) but it’s never safe to assume and move on I’d much prefer to know the cause For future reference I use nicotine, caffeine, and weed on a daily basis (wow, shocker I have bad anxiety huh?) I occasionally use cocaine when I’m drinking which isn’t that often about once every three months or so. And I drink on average 1 time a week. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and am prescribed Wellbutrin for it (for some fucking reason) Cross reference that ^ to your day to day life, if you see a lot of similarities I’d say we’re having the same issue and it’s most likely panic attacks brought on by smoking weed.

Also was diagnosed with benign twitching syndrome at age 14. I tried an early recovery group aa, naltrexone. Couldn’t stay sober more than five days. Now thanks to my family and another dose of pancreatitis. Yes another. I am at day 10 and am finally feeling normal again. Still some night sweats but the anxiety and twitching I masked with alcohol, the rebound was always worst making me drink again soon after work. It feels good, and you are all an inspiration.

sparklingicekiwistra [info] Health anxiety I’ll start off by stating that I have been diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago, but am currently not taking any medication. My anxiety has been terrible the last few months. I started having panic attacks which I’d never really suffered with them before. I’ve been skipping classes because I become so anxious when I have to sit still for too long and I start to think too much and stress. Recently I’ve been extremely hyper sensitive to anything that I feel physically. My head has had so much pressure in it and My muscles have been twitching. (Mostly in my toes and sometimes my head jolts) so this made me believe I was going to have a seizure.  earlier this week I left school with a terrible headache which later resulted to me pulling over on the side of the road to vomit. Now I am convinced i have a brain tumor.... I’m just so mentally exhausted from not just being like “oh the pollen count is extremely high I prob had a sinus headache which made me feel sick.” But my thoughts are more like “I have a brain tumor the cancer has probably spread through my entire body and I’ll be dead in 6 months” [info] None [info] 1553787117

djmor [info] Great post, thank you very much for your explanation.What about "fun" things? When you're doing something you find enjoyable, are you able to focus? When I went to college in Biotech, I absolutely loved it. I loved being in the lab, I always memorized every step of everything I needed to do. However, when it came time to writing down lab reports, english papers, math, it would take hours to get a few pages done, even if I did nothing but sit in front of the work. I'd start thinking and writing, and then my imagination would just slip in and start singing music, or slideshows of what I did in the lab, or play situations over and over in my mind and before I realize it ten minutes passed by and I'm only a sentence further. I've been diagnosed with anxiety issues, and I hear that those are often symptoms. Unfortunately, my anxiety meds that would quiet the voices would also cause me to become incredibly lethargic, enough that my creativity was stifled and I was unable to write anything other than short robotic sentences.I find it quite insulting that people would claim you had "an easy button" for work. But that's the nature of humans, they don't normally understand something without living it themselves. Mental disorders are horrible and complex things, and being "lucky" enough to have to take ritalin, or in my case valium, is a common thought for people who have no qualms abusing prescription drugs. In a way, it's also unfortunate that the drugs are so good at what they do that those that don't need it feel they want it. [info] None [info] 1402318091
Vermacian55 [info] Just diagnosed with NOT having ADHD, what now? I have been speculating for the past 3 years whether or not I have ADHD, and after half a year of sessions with a psychiatrist I am diagnosed with anxiety (and maybe avoidant personality disorder if I was older). While I definitely have anxiety, I do not feel like it is the reason for my lack of focus. I am currently in 2 year of university and am now two subjects behind. I have been self-medicating with nicotine with some success, and am basically only able to learn the subjects close to the exam date.I do not really know what to do now, as I have been kinda fixated on getting adhd medication to see if they help me. I am sort of planning on quitting nicotine and then basically see if I am even able to study in the next semester. Sort of like "I told you I had ADHD, look at me failing all these subjects!", but at the same time that feels stupid and is self-destructive.I do not know why I am writing this, as you guys can't really diagnose me... I just needed to talk about it with someone... [info] None [info] 1545067579
LupeTheKiller [info] [HELP] Understanding purpose of medicine: Geodon and Lamictal I went to the doctor today and I've been diagnosed with anxiety and obsessive and delusional thoughts. I was on Seroquel but I asked to switch cause of the weight gain. He told me that seroquel is the only medicine certified to treat the ups and downs, so I need to take two medicines. He said to think of it like an Oreo. I need medicine controlling my highs and lows in order to meet in the perfect middle. He prescribed me geodon, which I've read is the best for weight gain, and lamictal. He was kinda frustrated about my request and didn't believe seroquel effects metabolism. Anyways, can anyone explain the time of the two medicines in simple terms. Does one help lift my mood, while another control my mood/thoughts from spiraling out of control?

bk513 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was about 14. I’m sure I do have anxiety, but it took until my senior year of high school for a doctor to say i might have ADHD. I’ve had trouble with time management and focusing since I was 6 years old, but I was always led to believe I was just a “slow worker.” I’ve never had problems with hyperactivity and I had good grades, so I guess that made it harder to see. Most of my anxiety stems from issues that have been caused by ADHD this whole time. Sometimes I wonder if I would have anxiety at all if I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid.

thatsnuckinfutz [info] Any advice on trying to gain a lil bit of weight? Ok so let me start by saying I have not officially been diagnosed with ARFID reasoning is because my therapist is trying to give me a chance to get my eating (or lack thereof in my case) under control before sending me to an ED therapist. She agrees I definitely have it but that's not her specialty. I'm in therapy as part of a rehab program due to an injury unrelated to my eating habits however it came up as a concern since I've lost weight due to me restricting my food. I'm already slim so dropping more than 10lbs is very noticeable on me.Here's the issue, I have been diagnosed with anxiety and the more anxious I am the less likely I am to eat anything. For ex: I was stressed about my day so all I had was iced tea and 2 cookies for the day. I'm a vegetarian and also very picky, it's getting worse oddly enough. Is there any suggestions that those of you who are managing this better might have for me? I know it's not an easy fix but idk I don't really know where to start and I don't know anyone who struggles with these type of things. I'm trying to plan my meals but it's not going well lol [info] None [info] 1564006534

kawaiiyummycum [info] You're home alone and you hear a sound, you feel that sinking feeling. You're afraid, you try to calm yourself down, because its all in your head. Right? but you grab onto the closest hard object and listen closer just incase. Your heart pounds and so does your head in unison. It's that feeling but it crawls up on you with no reason. Anxiety is being afraid of nothing, your brain creating chemicals it does not need, your heart beats fast and you feel sick, you sweat and you can't think properly. It's crippling, it's so hard to deal with day in day out. The worst part is few people understand so when you start crying or hyperventilating, people just leave you and point and say things. It's hard, it feels like they are all against you during that small moment. I was diagnosed with anxiety 4 years ago, the medication did not suit my brain chemistry. So I just deal with it. It's difficult, it won't change or go away because I'm sick. It's just who I am.  [info] None [info] 1521952436
gateface970 [info] Getting ready to do something I never thought I was capable of! Ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 12, it’s ruled my life in one way or another. As a young teen, I had a hard time going out to eat, as I was terrified at the thought of my food not being properly prepared. Traveling was always really difficult, and I’d almost always have panic attacks on the way to the airport, as well as on the first morning of my trip. As a high schooler, I didn’t ever consider going to college out of state, as the idea of being more than three hours from home was too much to handle. In college, studying abroad was always something I dreamed of doing, but I was too afraid to go to another country all alone. I failed a lot in college too- my anxiety stopped me from admitting that I was struggling, even though I knew that I would do better if I just asked for help. I’m 22 now, and in less than seven weeks, I will be packing up my car, driving 1,100 miles away from home, and starting my dream internship. I’ll be living in a new house, in a new state, with people I’ve only talked to a handful of times. I’ll be away from my family, my friends, and my pets for three months. I’m leaving everything I’ve ever known behind, and I couldn’t be more excited! If you told me four years ago that I’d be doing this, I would have laughed. Never in a million years did I think my anxiety would allow me to do something like this! When I received the email offering me this position, I started crying, because I was so proud of myself for the progress I’ve made. I know I’ll still have my anxiety when I’m down there, and I know it won’t be easy, but I refuse to let it rule my life anymore! [info] None [info] 1574241252

HaxusPrime [info] Hake taken Wellbutrin/Bupropione for 3 days So I haven't been diagnosed as ADHD yet but will next appointment. I had to fill out a questionaire in order for me to be diagnosed. So I was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed wellbutrin. The wellbutrin has helped with anxiety, hyperactivity and focus. However, I feel like a zombie on this stuff. I feel tired and don't have the increase in motivation that I think adderall might give me. Due to me feeling and becoming a zombie. My dad literally said I was a ghost or zombie when I took it. I was initially surprised that wellbutrin would help adhd symptoms because I never even heard of it nor it isnt officially an adhd medication. However, it is designed to work on the same exact neurotransmitters as adderall! Norepinephrine and Dopamine! Also, studies show that wellbutrin works just as well as adderall for adult adhd! I was excited when I heard this.At the end of the day though I don't want to feel like a zombie and feel tired yet not feel the need to actually sleep. So I stopped it 4th day in. I believe from my results, adderall will be a better alternative giving me all wellbutrins benefits plus giving me the awake feeling that wellbutrin doesn't give me. [info] None [info] 1526773124

I was in nursing school when I had my injury but I look back and am like "why the hell would I want to be a nurse. I'm a jerk" lol but there are things I want to do, but I don't really know what I'm capable of doing.&gt;I'm just a completely different person than I was then. Although I still relate to a lot of nurses and nursing students.&gt;Secondly, my friends all either graduated college or moved away. I've tried reaching out but I just don't feel relatable with them anymore and they most likely feel the same about me. I'll be real.&gt;There just feels like a whole lot of bs in my way and I don't know how to fix it.Six years ago I was in a sort of similar spot as you, so I'm going to post my story. It's really long so you don't have to read it. I'm hoping you can glean something out of it if you do read it. All I want to do is help, maybe provide some advice because when I was going through my ordeal, I wish there was someone who could have been at my side for me. Anyway, I was in my 3th year of undergrad as a microbiology major. My goal was to get to medical school but I wasn't feeling it. All of my life my parents and family (I'm Korean-American) told me I had to become a doctor so it was ingrained inside of my mind that I needed to become a doctor. Becoming a doctor also resonated with my love for helping people. At the time my ultimate goal was to work establish a Doctor's Without Borders presence in North Korea (where I'm pretty sure lost parts of my family still reside, they were separated during the Korean War). From age 13 to 21 I dedicated my life to taking pre-med classes (like chem, calc, physics, ALL the Biology), making pre-med students (yes even in HS). I read books on becoming a doctor, watched TV shows on doctors, etc. When I began undergrad this feeling started to wear off. I hated all of my pre-med classes, I didn't know why I had to slave through them. I began to fail all of them. My pre-med friends were soaring through these classes and I didn't understand how they were doing it. My pre-med friends somehow got jobs at biology labs and were excelling at them (some even got published as early as their junior year). I began to ask myself "do I really want to become a doctor? Or was it something forced on me? If I don't become a doctor, then what can I do? I'm not good at anything else? What's the point of life if I cannot become a doctor?" At this point I had also ruled out other medical professional fields like becoming a pharmacist, dentist, or nurse. I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on Citalopram that year.The hard part was, I could still mostly relate to my pre-med friends and friends in med-school. Like them, I wanted to use science to help people and make a difference in the world. But my drive to become a doctor had fizzled out. I tried reaching out to them but I discovered that I couldn't relate to them any more. If I asked for advice all they told me were variations of: Oh you're just hitting a rough spot, you'll get through it, I know I did; maybe take some time off?; just man up, we're all suffering here, just do it; maybe become a pharmacist, dentist or nurse. They just didn't get what I was going through. The worst part was, no one told me something like "maybe becoming a Doctor isn't for you, maybe look at another thing to go into? Here let's take a look at other options outside of medicine." So at this point I didn't know what else I was capable of and there was a lot of BS in my way and I didn't know how to fix it. A part of me still wanted to become a doctor, but I didn't want to do it anymore. On top of all this, I had ALOT of parental and family pressure from home to become a doctor. Anything else would have literally brought shame to the family. I'm not kidding about this, I know it's very stereotypical of Asian American families, but I was from one of those stereotypical Asian American families. I can go on-and-on about this, but that's another story. Anyway, I had been lying to my family about my grades. All they wanted from me was to get to med school. To tell my family I was failing my pre-med courses and/or losing my desire for med school would have devastated my them, they would most likely yell at me for hours over the phone, humiliate me, tell me I was hurting them, tell me I was selfish, I'm a failure at life, I'll die homeless and poor, just guilt trip me into oblivion. The summer before my 3rd year and the following fall semester was when I just gave up on becoming a doctor. I stopped going to all of classes, I slept all day, played board games with friends, played ALOT of video games, did anything that wasn't academic related. Maybe I had cracked? I don't know. I felt like I was only living one day at a time with no plans for the future. I was like this until March of my 3rd year in college. I went on a volunteer summer break trip to a state park in Virginia where I helped construct dams using rocks on the Potomac River and other labor intensive landscaping stuff. Being able to work with the earth while being surrounded by it helped me (yes this will sound super corny) connect to our planet for the first time in 15 years. I say 15 years because the last time I felt this way was when I was 6, that summer my parents took me to the Chicago Field Museum where I fell in love with the volcano and geology exhibits (there was a dark room with a glowing Hawaiian lava flow exhibit that frightened me at first, but I slowly become fascinated by it). Later that summer I took my first nature walk at forest preserve. Flash forward 15 years, back at the state park in Virginia, there were some other volunteers from my school who were geology majors. I overheard them talking about river delta systems while we sat on a bridge that over looked a small sandy river delta emptying out into the Potomac. I was drawn to their conversation as my memories of falling in love with geology and volcano exhibits from age 6. After talking with these geology students I became hooked. When I got back to school I scheduled a visit with the geology dept at my school. All of the professors I talked to were kind and saw in my eyes a passion for rocks slowly reigniting. Switching into geology was easy to do. But psychologically it was difficult. All of my friends told me I was crazy and stupid for changing to a completely different major during the spring semester of my 3rd year. People told me things like "just suck it up and finish your degree, you only have 1 more year", "it'll be a waste of your parents' money", and the worst "how selfish of you to waste your education like that, if you wanted to do geology you should have started as a freshman!". I also knew I had to tell my parents what I was about to do, and they would not take it kindly. Remember all of the things I wrote earlier on what I thought my family would do if I told them I had lost interest in becoming a doctor? Well it all happened on a Sunday in April when I finally made the call. I didn't talk to my family for 2 months. But at that point I had already decided to become a geologist no matter what anyone else told me, I had to right to be selfish about my life by that point because my passion to become something had been re lit. Now this didn't mean things got easier for me. From then until now things have been difficult. I barely finished my geology degree, wasn't sure what geology subfield I wanted to get into, had to suffer the reality of student loans, deal with the BS my family gave me for giving up becoming a medical professional, took 3 years off and worked for AmeriCorps, then finally somehow got into grad school for geology where I am now. Currently I am stressed beyond belief about my grad program, but I know I have the drive to force myself through the stress because I'm passionate about it. So long story short, it takes a lot of time for someone to discover a new passion for something when their old passion fizzles out. My story is vastly different from yours because I never had a severe brain injury that completely changed my life. But our stories are also related because I went through a phase of confusion and disillusionment and I wanted you to know you're not alone. I read you loved hiking and snowboarding with friends. Keep on doing that. If you love it and makes you happy, don't stop. Life is more than just having a career. I know that's a corny phrase, but it's true. And I deeply wish one day society will change where life experiences are valued over how much money someone can make. Finally, a little shameless pitch for you to consider pursuing geology. You seem like someone who loves the outdoors. Ever wonder how the mountains you snowboard on formed, study geology. Ever wonder why some mountains are volcanic and some are not, study geology. Ask any question about how a natural vista formed and geology will be able to provide fascinating answers. Come drop by /r/geology if you're interested. Lot's of nice people there who can answer any questions. And if any one is a jerk to you there, they'll be met with angry geologists armed with rock hammers, dynamite, and bottles of acid (we drop acid on limestone to see if it fizzes, helps us determine if a rock is limestone or not). I hope all of this helped. If you want any advice or have questions (about anything, us geologists do more than just look at rocks all day), feel free to reply to this comment or PM me.

Butthole_Berserker [info] Anxiety and Adderall I was diagnosed with anxiety over 12 years ago, in my mid 20s.  Recently ive finally started visiting a psychologist.  One night i was up and couldnt sleep so i made a list of all the things that make me anxious.  Turns out 90% of them are the same as ADHD symptoms.  Anyway, after 12+ years on lexapro/xanax they want to try adderall and im extremely anxious about being put on a stimulant.  Is it possible to have both GAD and ADHD?  Do any of you have experince with anything similar?  Thanks! [info] None [info] 1486520845
obladi- [info] To completely simplify the whole situation and get down to the basics: you should never be with someone who doesn’t want you to feel your absolute best at all times.I was diagnosed with anxiety long before I started dating my boyfriend. He doesn’t suffer from any mental health issues whatsoever and sometimes has difficulty in understanding how I’m feeling when I’m at my worst, but he is ALWAYS supportive and does anything he can to be present and sympathetic when I need him. Everybody deserves that. You deserve that, OP. If you’re struggling and there’s an option for you that could potentially improve your health and quality of life, fuck whoever wants to keep you from going down that path.

jesssrhee [info] I think I have tinnitus? Hi everyone, I’m 21 and am in college rn. Just as a background before I get into things: I was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago, but it’s been a lot worse these last two months. It’s always the worst when I go to bed because I have an irrational fear that something bad will happen while I’m sleeping. Over the last two months, random aches and pains in my body set off my anxiety into thinking there was something wrong with me, when in fact there was not. So, this brings me to last Sunday when I heard a faint ringing noise in my left ear as I was trying to fall asleep. This immediately set off my anxiety, and I became paranoid about what I was hearing. Suddenly I felt as if I was hearing a faint ringing noise. Eventually I was able to fall asleep and when I woke up I didn’t hear the ringing. As the week progressed, it felt like every night when I tried to go to sleep, the silence was too loud. Last night, I only got about 1.5 hours of sleep, because it seemed that the ringing was louder. I don’t know if it’s my mind playing tricks on me since my anxiety tends to do that, or if I do have tinnitus. The ringing seems to be very noticeable at night. During the day I can only hear it if it’s quiet and I’m focusing on the sound.I’m starting to freak out that it might be tinnitus. I recently started taking anxiety medication and have a fear that may have caused it. Also, I’ve abused the volume on my earbuds/headphones for way too long now, and am thinking that may have caused this.I’m mostly just writing this for sanity lol, but also to get some insight from others in this group. I plan on meeting with my doctor to get things checked out.Thanks so much for reading! [info] None [info] 1581768729

AggravatingCupcake0 [info] I've definitely experienced some of the same issues as your wife. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, and my PCP and I suspect I may have ADD although my psychiatrist refused to formally diagnose me with it for stupid reasons. What happens is, you have a task or two to do. Then one day you don't get anything done because you went on a trip into the city, or had a day out with friends, etc. Then the task or two has doubled and now you suddenly have four tasks. Ok, so you try to tackle the four tasks in a day, but you only manage to get one done. The next day comes, now you have five tasks. And very quickly, it reaches a point where you have so much to do that it's overwhelming and through flawed logic you figure it's better to do nothing at all than try to plow your way through this mountain of tasks that lie before you because you'll never finish them anyway. I suspect that maybe your wife is going through this as well? So, on to solutions: I went to a therapist for a while, and while I don't do this all the time it does help when I do - he told me to schedule out my days in advance. As in, make an hour-by-hour list of things to do, and give a finite amount of time to each task. For example, your wife can say "Ok, tomorrow I'm going to pack my Etsy sales for two hours. At the end of two hours, that's it. I move on to the next task that I have scheduled." This way, she gets stuff done - it may not be as much as she hoped, but it's something, and makes things more manageable and less daunting than going "Ok, I have to get ALL these Etsy items packed TODAY" and feeling exhausted and defeated after four hours of packing and having gotten nothing else done. It also puts pressure on her to finish her tasks in a timely manner. Perhaps you guys can work out a schedule for her like this? I know that when I employ this method I'm like "Oh shit, I got five things done in two hours instead of the one thing I would have normally gotten done."  [info] None [info] 1543320419
anasasis0321 [info] Is it normal to pretend that the worst possible outcome is happening/has happened even though there are no real signs of it being true? I’ve noticed that I work myself up, thinking about the worst possible outcomes of situations. For example, I pretend my mom is dying/dead, like she passed in a terrible way, and believe it’s true for a few moments and end up crying for a while. It’s like I’m preparing myself so I won’t grieve as much when it actually DOES happen, and I won’t be totally surprised. Its like I catastrophize everything. I think about my boyfriend leaving me, although our relationship is very calm and comfortable. We communicate extremely well, and there’s no “red flags” that indicate even in the slightest way, that our relationship is headed down a bad path. I think that isn’t a very good thing to do, because it means I’m telling myself lies, and I’m not paying attention to reality, and I don’t want my fears to dictate how I really act in real life. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, so maybe this is normal because of that? I have no idea, I’m just wondering if anybody else does the same. [info] None [info] 1553704167

ThatGuyNoOneRemember [info] Vision problems Age: 20 Sex: Male Height: 5'9 Weight: 160 Ethnicity: Hispanic For a little context, this problem started about two weeks ago. I spent the past year (since last August) worrying, obsessing, fearing over my health. And just recently have I been able to finally accept that I don't have certain ailments that I convinced myself were overlooked or missed by my doctors. I've previously gone to my primary doctor(s) and hospital multiple times, done different tests--x-rays, blood tests, urine tests, ekg's--and it's always coming back negative, which includes blood pressure and blood sugar. I was diagnosed with anxiety and vitamin D deficiency. I thought for almost a year that I had diabetes, but after so much denial I come to terms that I don't have diabetes. Whenever I stand up it feels like my vision is going black and I'm about to pass out, I see these white floating stars and like a blue dot in the corner of my eye or a streak if I stare too long at a light source. Sometimes it feels like my heartbeat is nonexistent but when I calm down, stand up and feel my chest, my heart is beating like normal.My diet is poor. I just barely started eating again, and when I do it's usually a burger or chips. But I'm eating sandwiches now, and soup and drinking almond milk. I drink plenty of water, but I don't work out or exercise. Please help. [info] None [info] 1564632889

beesbeme [info] Hello! I am not a doctor, but I have been diagnosed with anxiety for most of my life now. What you are describing sounds like a panic attack. You don't necessarily need a specific trigger to have a panic attack. Sometimes it's just the expulsion of pent-up stress, or maybe you do have a trigger but you haven't noticed it. Panic attacks always happen for a reason, but sometimes that reason isn't very clear. Try to remember how you were feeling, what you were doing, and where you were before and during each panic attack. If there are any similarities between each situation then that might be the cause!In my experience, some of my panic attacks come from not breathing enough and having lots of tension, which is something that I've only realized very recently. When I'm stressed or concentrating very hard I tend to take slow and short breaths. The body goes 'woah, that's not enough oxygen,' so it makes you panic. So, whenever I feel a panic attack coming on, I force myself to take a step back from what I'm doing and breathe. A great and easy to remember breathing exercise is to breath in as much as you can, hold for a second, before breathing out slowly. It works 9/10, if I catch it fast enough. Of course, all of that is my personal experience and there's no telling if it will work for you. The best advice I cam give you is to talk to a psychiatrist. Seriously, they will help a lot, even if this is a rare thing. Panic attacks are scary enough without having a support structure. Good luck! [info] None [info] 1536995447
Lalaloey [info] I'm terrified. I never thought, I would have to post something like this. First up, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I have never thought of school as a good place, but honestly, now, it's not hatred, it's fear. I am afraid to go back to damn school. That's something, that really shows what are earth is coming too. Of May 2018, there was 23 fucking school shootings. I honestly, have a genuine fear, someone will burst into my school, aim a gun and shoot. Sure, I've never been the most full of life and all, but this is not how i would want to go. There hasn't been a school shooting in my state....yet. 21 weeks into 2018, and on average there would be 1 school shooting a week. My only question, is what is the president doing about this? Oh, no sorry. NOTHING. Should I be scared for my life going to a place where I am supposedly supposed to learn and grow? Honestly, If a school shooting does happen, and someone I care about, dies because our fucking government isn't doing anything, I'm not sure i'll be able to live anymore. I'm so scared...and honestly, August, 26th, yes so recently, there was a mass shooting in florida, what the hell is america coming too? I might be dead before, I even get to college, or sooner.

NCTrumpFan [info] Does anyone else use desipramine? Hi. I was diagnosed with anxiety with obsessional features (after getting diagnosed with IBS-mixed). My new PCP gave me 25mg desipramine (once a day before bed). I've had an easier time getting out of bed in the morning and getting on with my day, but I've also been getting constipated. I'm also still my usual self (agonized over a $9 meal at McDonald's, finally ordered, then chickened out after they took so long to get to me, and walked all the way to Dairy Queen). Does anyone else use desipramine? If so, what are your experiences with it? [info] None [info] 1571514412
Merchanting [info] I've tried it, and wouldn't recommend it. I've been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, and had tried 1mg k-pins and propranolol prescribed for me. The only one that really helped me during high anxiety times was the k-pins, so I pursued other benzos when my doctor got stingy on the prescriptions.I bought 80x 4mg bars because they were cheap af, less than 150 for all. My intentions were 1mg a few times a week, for some chilling and some high anxiety situations. I lost that regimine basically the day I got them. Day one I took a quarter before school. It was nice for my anxiety, and didn't have me fiending for more. Still, when I got home I wanted another quarter for relaxing and sleeping. When I woke up the next day, I was still a bit unrestrained and decided to take another quarter before school again. This cycle of lowering inhibitions and taking even more kept happening. Within a week I was taking halves and skipping class. This ended in me sleeping in late one day, only about a week after buying the bars. I walked in half way through class, and it was a fucking test I had forgot about. Sat outside and filled with social/school anxiety and so I took more bar. I got really depressed and no longer had control of my drug use because I was too emotional. I took a cocktail of drugs/alcohol and ended up getting sent to the drunk tank when I refused an ambulance. This doesn't happen to everyone, but it's not super uncommon either. Xanax is too much too fast for most people. It worked for anxiety, but it's easier than you think to get addicted. Almost a year later and my anxiety is a lot better. Not sure what clicked, but it wasn't from continued benzo use.  [info] None [info] 1541101472
JLeww69 [info] Earlier this year I was diagnosed with anxiety after a long conversation with my parents. After two therapy sessions I met with a doctor to discuss what my options were. I explained to her that a few of my friends have anxiety and that they've gone through a variety of different medications with no avail. They were finally prescribed gabapentin which worked the best out of all the medications they had tried. I told her that after researching all of my options I decided that gabapentin would be the best choice for me since I didn't want anything addicting like a benzo or a ssri because of the wd horror stories. She acted like she had never heard of gabapentin before and prescribed me propranolol which doesn't seem to work at all. Prop's main use is to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety such as rapid heartbeat and sweating which I never even reported experiencing with my therapist prior to the meeting with the doctor... The whole spiel about my friends getting prescribed gabapentin was a lie but I truly did believe gabapentin would be the best option for me. Plus I knew it would be useful for the kratom addiction I had at the time. Oh well. I just had to get all of that off my chest.  [info] None [info] 1506879015

ItIs430Am [info] I would say go to the DAV, yes. If someone wants to chime in and correct me, by all means, but the DAV is literally there for helping veterans with disability claims. In all facets. At first I was worried about making the switch, but they've made it so much easier. My first representative was the American Legion and my first claim went through pretty fast, but since I moved and was told about the DAV, I have done everything through them. Got my appointments set up and everything has been easy. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD and the psychologist who did my evaluation basically confirmed it. With PTSD, I'm sure you will get the correct diagnosis. They wont look at you and think "oh they're lying." Itll be taken very seriously. On that note, and remember this, the evaluation does not mean you will be treated. For disability, you are getting evaluated to confirm your condition. You need to either get referred to or see the VA psychiatrist/therapist (I see the VA ones). They will work with you to determine how often you need to go and what you need to do to be successful down the road.  [info] None [info] 1523117839

CuteThingsAndLove [info] Is it really bad to be addicted to xanax? My doctor and family were all very concerned about me when I was diagnosed with anxiety many years ago, and my doctor did give me a prescription of xanax, but made sure my dad didnt give me any unless I absolutely needed it (in full panic attack mode, basically).Now that I'm older, I'm just thinking about it more. When I take the xanax, I feel a type of calmness I never have had in my normal life, its very peaceful. So I always said, I can see why people would become addicted to this, I would take it every day if that wasn't an issue. The bottle of 60 pills he prescribed me at 16/17 is still on my desk at age 22.My question is, how bad is it to become addicted to xanax? What are the side effects of it, is it dangerous, and what are the withdrawal symptoms? Do you become immune to the effects after a while and need to make the dosage larger, or do the effects stay the same?Hopefully someone with first hand experience on it sees this question. I would post this in a medical sub but I much prefer this sub as I feel less embarrassed asking on here.Edit: Thank you everyone for the answers. I wasn't planning on getting addicted to xanax, I was just wondering about the side effects as the people in my life were always very nervous about it without ever really explaining it to me, so I was simply curious. There is addiction in my family so they were incredibly cautious with me. But again, I only very rarely take it.Thank you again! [info] None [info] 1506090986

MrsNacho8000 [info] Do you guys think there's something wrong? Hi internet parents,I lost my mom last year and I've been having a really rough time lately. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and sometimes I see a therapist, but I'm starting to wonder if maybe something else is wrong.It's a struggle for me to get up in the morning. My alarm will wake me up but I just lay in bed and have no motivation...I wait til the very last second to get up for work, and I do that reluctantly. Every day I consider calling out of work and don't care about getting in trouble.I'm a big girl and I've recently lost 60 lbs, only to put it all back on. I hate myself for it.I used to love going out and doing things, anything really. Now I cancel plans to sit at home in my pajamas.I'm turning 32 next month so I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just getting older. Can any internet parents weigh in here? [info] None [info] 1583750246

EclipseAnon3 [info] Would this qualify for FMLA? Ended up in ER. Due to work stress and outside life factors the past few weeks have been horrible for me. It progressed from going to urgent care, to primary care, and yesterday I ended up in the ER. I've been at my job for several years and while it has it's stressful moments it's taking a toll on my mental health over the years. Last week I woke up with respiratory issues and went to work the following day. The breathing issues got worse at work and I had to go to urgent care. This had not happened before. Urgent care said tests were normal. I was given an inhaler. Then I went to my doctor and he couldn't find anything physically wrong either. Tests came back normal. I don't have allergies or asthma. I'm relatively healthy, work out a few times a week, watch what I eat. The respiratory issue never really went away and I had a trip planned. On the plane I was having a very hard time breathing, gasping at some points but trying to stay calm while I was freaking out on the inside. But as soon as I walked off I was very fatigued and gasping for air. My ride took me to the ER and they ran all the tests including a CT scan. Could not find anything physically wrong which was frustrating. While at the ER I was diagnosed with anxiety attacks. They said I was hyperventilating from all the stress. I have never had panic or anxiety attacks so this was news to me. I'm dreading going back to work and feel like my mental and physical health are at risk now. How do I proceed with FMLA or do I just suck it up? [info] None [info] 1567139241

ChaviChavChop [info] Having heart palpitations when relaxed or laying down. Happens every five minutes or so. Literally just came from the doctor and they ran several tests and all was fine. The doc saw some PAC/PVCs on the monitor but said it wasn’t anything to worry about. But they still happen. Any advice? 23, male, 250lbs, 6 ft tall. Propranolol 10mg, Buspirone 5mgSo, yeah, I was diagnosed with anxiety and I was taking Celexa 40mg but my doc said prolonged use of Celexa can have some side effects she did not like, so she wanted me off it. I was getting tremendously better anyways. Earlier I went to the ER because my heart was “skipping beats” like once a minute. I know it’s not actually skipping beats, PAC/PVCs are really extra beats and twitches of the heart muscle. But you know. Anyway, doc does a short ECG, attaches me to a love heart monitor, does a chest X-ray, and a blood panel. He comes back and says everything’s fine. But while I waited, I got some palpitations and PAC/PVCs and could see them on the heart monitor. Big, pronounced heartbeat lines and they are kinda squiggly instead of sharp and even. The doc said he saw them too, but wasn’t concerned. He told me you can have up to 30 palpitations per hour before it starts to get worrisome (he did say that of course a cardiologist may say 10 per day, let alone per hour, is worrisome for certain people, but my tests are good and my heart is healthy, that’s not worrisome for me.)So he said it’s all in my head, all because of my anxiety. It calmed me down a lot, and the rest of the day was good. I have an appointment with my family doc on Monday, and she’s going to take a look at the test results. But I’m still left wondering. These PAC/PVCs (I say both because I don’t know which they actually are, may not even be those could be something else) but anyway they feel so weird and disconcerting. But my doctor swears I’m fine, and I’m inclined to believe him and my family doc both. But, why are these heart palpitations occurring?Does anxiety really have the ability to cause stuff like this when you’re otherwise fit as a fiddle?Are there medicines I could ask my doc about that could reduce the occurrence of these palpitations?I know I’m not at risk of any serious issues now, but it’s still annoying. Especially when I get an episode of them where it’s like one every other minute. Also, it seems to happen the most when I’m relaxed, or trying to lay down and sleep. What gives?

lonelyanxiousfreak [info] It will be difficult to type me since my medical condition influences my emotions and hobbies. It is a mobility-challenged related disability. And my other medical condition gives me self esteem issues as a female physically.• How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.I am a 17 year old soon to be 18 girl. I play video games, read on science, and love human anatomy.• Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. And my disability (condition) makes me bitter toward abled people.• Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?I was abused as an infant, my feet tied together and never given toys or talked to, only when I needed food and water (poor orphanage). When I was adopted at age 2, I became part of a Catholic family. We rarely practice and only pray on holidays. I personally don’t believe in a higher being.• What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?I have none.• If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?I would be refreshed despite wanting friends for once. I need my alone time often since I am energetic in public or am overwhelmed by crowds, smell, touch, sounds, etc• What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?I like video games and drawing but due to neck pain they are burning out fast. I want to like sports, but am banned from the ones I’ve always wanted to try (why I resent those who play them). I would love outdoor walks if my skin wasn’t hypersensitive. But for now I am an indoor person due to medical reasons. I love music though. Music sparks my vivid imagination and distracts me from my pain.• How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?Let’s just say people are extremely annoyed by me because I ask “why” to everything. And I do have more ideas than I can execute. My curiosities are why people are being nice, ask how I am, how the universe works, how animals relate to each other, etc.. My ideas are conceptual and about the universe and the far future of it and earth.• Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?No. But yes, I think I would be fairly okay. I first would assign a task for each person and expect them to do it regardless of circumstances unless physical problem.• Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?I seem to get into arguments a lot, so probably not. And I enjoy playing with clay. It makes my sensitive skin feel nice. Ceramics or simple clay is the activity.• Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.I used to be very artistic but am not anymore. I draw my original character, a transgender shapeshifter trying to fit into a human society.• What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?I think of the past and future too much. I hate thinking about the past and can never move on until I get closure. And I think about the far future because it’s fun and you get to make up depressing scenarios of the earth ending. The present is fine but I believe in those who are competent should be alive and anyone who fails constantly should be discarded. If I was a ruler I would be like the government in the Harrison Bergeron short story.• How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?I hate when others ask for my help. It’s not my problem. I do it anyway to appear good or expect something in return.• Do you need logical consistency in your life?Yes. Dear god.• How important is efficiency and productivity to you?It is not that important unless I was a leader of a company.• Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that?I correct people or point out flaws, but that’s as far as I go unless someone’s incompetent in-game sensitivity is pissing me off because it’s too high.• What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?I play video games, draw, and read online. I honestly don’t like them that much besides video games. It’s painful to do pretty much anything except breathing, so video games are the least painful hobby therefore I’ll do it.• What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?I memorize. I am too stupid to truly understand a concept. Math, I struggle with a lot and hate. Numbers shift or disappear in my head, even like simple 5+7 I can’t solve in my head unless I use my fingers. I prefer classes that use memorization and logic like biology, chemistry, physics, any science or history related class. People say I have an abnormally good memory for my academics or trivial facts.• How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go?I am good at it but never take action using it. I break up projects according to what I think I can do in a certain period of time. This is for school only. For my own projects I improvise.• What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally?I want to be a radiologist! I find anatomy fascinating. And personally I want to be happy and true to myself.• What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?A lot. Tardigrades, spiders, ants, etc.. But seriously, those who are younger than me and smarter, abled people, girls (have another medical condition that makes me kind of jealous of “normal” girls), and anyone who makes me look handicapped or stupid. I heavily rely on what my mind is capable of since my body is useless. I hate fake people who just smile to be nice. I want a damn conversation where someone replies with something other than “okay” or “cool.” And who won’t mind my partial hearing loss and repeat something maybe four times.• What do the "highs" in your life look like?Video game victories unfortunately and also overcoming 17 surgeries. In general though, figuring on my own what medical condition someone has from an image alone, getting a math problem right because of possible dyscalculia, and being called “smart” to boost my nonexistent self-esteem.• What do the "lows" in your life look like?I never talk about negative emotions. At worst I talk about anger. I have never discussed deep sadness with anyone in my life. I put emotional walls up and bottle up my feelings since I don’t think crying is rational. And I get annoyed by those who cry anyway (could be projecting). I would prefer to keep my funny, outgoing, friendly and happy image alive.• How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so?I am attached to it fairly well, but only due to hypersensitivity and easy distraction externally. If I wasn’t then I would be daydreaming endlessly. I wear music for sound sensitivity and usually I start daydreaming. And I am aware of my surroundings usually. But I get startled if someone touches me while I daydream.• Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?When will we all be killed and what will our dystopian civilization look like?How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?If important, a few days. And usually I change my mind and have endless alternatives I worry about.• How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?I do not process them. I reject any hint of sadness and put it in the back of my head. I hate emotions. But if a subject intrigues me I will be grinning the entire time shouting about it.• Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why?Never. It’s not my problem if you disagree. I will argue until I get closure like a good discussion and conclusion or am declared right.• Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why?No. They should not be challenged usually. If I do break rules, I want to experience what others do on a daily basis like doing sports I am not supposed to do (basketball or dodgeball are examples). Or I break rules ironically to do academic work like homework during school mass in the bathroom secretly. Hey, free hour and a half study hall, okay?• What is the ideal life, in your opinion?The ability to exercise and play sports without pain, middle or higher financial class, having friends but also mainly being a loner, and being happy in your own skin.

paralogisme [info] Anxiety from wearing my spiffy new back brace So today I finally received [my back brace](https://www.orliman.com/en/product/semi-rigid-lumbar-back-support-2/) for 2 disc hernias and peraminal stenosis. I of course expected to be uncomfortable for a second, I wore corsets in my uni days. But what I got was unexpected. I put on the brace (well, the medical professional did, but I also did it myself few times) and half an hour in, terrible anxiety kicks in. Now I am diagnosed with anxiety and all that jazz, but this was horrible. I started shaking, nausea, extreme discomfort in limbs, a full size anxiety attack. I've tried it 2 today for half an hour and basically rage quit at some point on the verge of tears and even took a Valium to calm the heck down. I just took it down 10 minutes ago and I am still dizzy. I'm so unwell that I am actually worried that it's not just anxiety but a consequence of a tight brace pressing on lungs or something.Does this routinely happen with new brace wearers, something that I have to slowly get used to or could this be a case of a brace that doesn't fit and I should ask for a refitting?I was very excited about getting this brace because I am in a lot of pain and want to get off painkillers, so I'm really sad that this is my reaction to it.

I think you’re absolutely right about the circumstances surrounding our births. Every story is different. My first, was traumatic and I had no help. My mother left for a different province 16 hours away, 4 hours after I gave birth. My in laws created an embarrassing scene, just impacting my trauma even more.

cuebabies [info] I’m 25, just diagnosed with anxiety disorder, unsure if symptoms are all related to anxiety. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder just 2 months ago. In short I had a massive panic attack after smoking some weed 2 years ago since then I’ve been very anxious when I feel a symptom similar to the attack. Fast heart rate, dizziness, chest pains, and muscle spasms all get me thinking something bad is about to happen. I notice in the onset of an attack my bowels get loose as well. I’ve come to accept this is anxiety, a couple of doctors have told me the same.1 week ago I woke up with a headache and it’s been on and off until today, sometimes it’s intense other times it’s just barely noticeable.  Also I’ll feel pins and needles on my chest and what feels like the heart. Does anyone know if this is also related to anxiety?? [info] None [info] 1546571281
45MinutesOfRoadHead [info] Anxiety. When I was in college I would start driving to campus, get to campus, and wind up walking into the student center for coffee and stay there instead of going to class. I never understood why I would do this. I knew I should go to class, and when it came time to actually go I would divert and go somewhere else. I still can't pinpoint exactly what about going to class freaked me out so much, because I like people and I'm a very social person. I wound up withdrawing.It wasn't until I had a nervous breakdown that I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on zoloft. Zoloft helped, and while it kept me from freaking out, it kept me from getting excited at the same time. I eventually came off of it and now live unmedicated, but I still experience invasive thoughts of doom daily. I've decided I won't have more than one child because I don't think I could handle worrying that much. I'm always assuming my son is going to die from anything at any second, and I can't imagine what it'd be like if I had another.Also, I have ADHD. That goes like "The dishes need to be done, start dishes, but wait! There's something sticky on the counter, stop the dishes and wipe the counter. Did I lock the door? Gotta check. Hold up, do the cats have food in their bowl? Go check food, then put the laundry in the dryer. Hold on, you have to pee. The counter is cluttered. Start putting things away. Oh yeah! Dishes!

CaterpillarRage [info] This hits me so hard. I went to a doctor's appointment a few months ago and I just made a mention that my anxiety was making it hard for me to sleep recently and that could be why my headaches have gotten so bad and the doctor totally dismissed me. She started saying that she doesn't think I actually have anxiety (even though I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 19). This was the second time I ever saw this doctor and she didn't take me seriously until I started to cry and defend myself. It was ridiculous. This isn't the first time that this has happened to me and makes me so angry.

roselove122 [info] Initially I was diagnosed with anxiety, which she did help with. I felt a lot better when I went. I pretty much had a mental break down and could barely function. I was then diagnosed with ptsd, or cptsd. Which perhaps is not something she's able to help me with as the sessions kept getting worse and worse. I would come home and need to sleep for hours to relieve them. I also started getting more depressed and getting worse thoughts. I did bring it up with her, but in our last session I felt like she's turned it around on me saying that I didn't practise the coping skills enough which is why I'm unable to help myself. I honestly don't know if she's right or not. But my gut feeling just said no. Because of some events that happened to me when I was really young, I had really big issues with telling people how I feel. Sometimes I just shut down and nothing comes out. Like my response is just to freeze instead of flight or fight. That's one of the reasons why I'm feeling like I need a break from therapy as I've never really talked to anyone about most of the stuff from my childhood and bringing it up is making my adult life worse as I feel like I can't function.

macmoosie [info] One night, being a Good Samaritan almost killed me. “Do you think you could give me a ride home?”It was that innocent and seemingly innocuous question that damn near brought me to Death’s doorstep. It wasn’t a hitchhiker on the side of the road or a straggler outside of a gas station. It was a stranger, sure, but it was one who was fairly close to my circle of friends, and I never saw it coming. My best friend always told me that my kindness would be the death of me. I’ve forgiven cheating ex-boyfriends, abusive friends, and betraying family members. I’ve given friends rides to and from and I’ve stayed up all night to talk an acquaintance out of suicide. I ordered a pizza for someone who’d just lost their job and couldn’t afford a meal. I was always blessed growing up and one day, finally having realized the magnitude of my blessings, decided to start paying it forward whenever I was physically and financially able.The incident occurred about four or five years ago on a quiet Friday night. I’d opted for a night in with Netflix and snacks rather than going out for drinks and karaoke. I was living with my parents at the time and my mother was visiting my grandmother, so it was just my father, the pets, and I in the house. I found myself curled up in bed having a little Guy Ritchie marathon, since my dad was sprawled out on the couch watching some classic Batman films from the golden era. I was about twenty minutes into Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels when I heard the familiar sound of a Facebook Messenger notification chiming on my phone.I reached over and opened the message, seeing it was from someone I knew of, but had never actually met before; his name was Alan. We had a moderate handful of mutual friends and despite never seeing him before in my life, I’d accepted the friend request he sent a few weeks back. He seemed to talk to some people I knew on a regular basis, so I figured he just wanted to expand his circle. He posted some rather funny memes and the often relatable millennial joke posts here and there. I’d never actually talked to him before, but we’ve mutually liked each other’s content. I was a little surprised to actually receive a message from him, especially around 10pm on a random Friday night.“Hey.”Simple and innocent enough, I supposed.“Hey man, how’s it going?” I replied, keeping it chill and casual, plopping my phone back on the bed and resuming my movie.He responded almost immediately. “Good. Hey, listen, I’m at my friend’s house and everyone is drunk and shit. Do you think you could give me a ride home?”Weird. I literally didn’t know this guy whatsoever other than having mutual friends and completely out of the blue, he messages me, of all people, to ask for a ride. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little annoyed at the idea of having to leave the house, but more so for someone who’d have the…audacity…for lack of a better word, to ask me to.On the other hand, it was kind of late and fairly cold outside, buses had already stopped running, Uber and Lyft weren’t a thing in my town back then, and getting a taxi could be expensive.“Where are you?”“55 Spring Road. I live at 93 Juliet Street.”With a quick search on Apple Maps, I saw that he wasn’t too far away and surprisingly lived a couple of miles north of me. I figured it wouldn’t take all that long to do him the favor, and at least he wouldn’t have to walk in the cold or get a ride from someone who’d been drinking and endanger both of their lives.“Give me a few minutes to get dressed and I’ll let you know when I’m there.”“Awesome, thanks!”I had a weird feeling in the pit of my stomach, but I was diagnosed with anxiety and it always made a point to resurface when it came to meeting someone new. I threw on a pair of jeans and a hoodie, slipped into my “going wherever, I need shoes” pair of sneakers, and collected my wallet, phone, and keys before heading into the living room to announce my departure. Despite being an adult, I always made a point out of mutual respect, to inform my parents where I was going and for what reason.As I climbed into the cabin of my SUV, the feeling in my stomach grew stronger and I couldn’t figure out why my internal monologue was telling me to abort mission, go back upstairs, ignore any messages Alan sent, and apologize in the morning saying I fell asleep. I shook the thought and started the commute.When I pulled up to the house and parked across the street, I noticed that the only source of light was coming from one of the windows on the third floor. Even with my windows closed, I could hear the unmistakable sound of drunken youthful banter. I messaged Alan to let him know I arrived and a moment later, a figure appeared in the window and seemed to be looking down at me. In that moment, I was thankful that my windows were tinted as dark as legally possible, so there was no way whoever that was could have seen me staring back, trying to make out his features.A few minutes went by before Alan finally responded saying he was on his way down, but the man at the window hadn’t moved a muscle whatsoever. Eventually, the front door opened and there was Alan, easily recognizable in the now illuminated porch light — probably motion sensors — looking exactly like he does in his Facebook pictures. He hopped down the steps, backpack over his shoulder, and made his way over to me, having been inside the only vehicle on the street with its headlights on.He opened the door and climbed into the passenger seat, dropping his backpack between his feet. He greeted me with an oddly enthusiastic hello and leaned over to give me a hug. Weird, but my masculinity isn’t so fragile as to decline a hug from another guy. I started to drive off and glanced up at the third floor window again to find the man still watching. The fight or flight feeling in my stomach came back twice as hard.“Thanks for the ride, man, I really appreciate it.”“Yeah, no problem,” I replied, forcing a smile.I kept the radio at a low volume and kept an eye on Alan in my peripheral vision. He would occasionally look out of the window, glance at me, and go back to the window. His right leg was bouncing up and down, as if he was nervous about something, and I noticed he kept scratching his thigh. In hindsight, they were obvious signs of nervousness or anxiety, but I had no idea why at the present moment.“Nice car, by the way. What is it, a brand new X5?”I nodded. “Yeah, it is. I just got it a few months ago.”Alan whistled. “Damn, must have been expensive.”I didn’t acknowledge the question. There was something about his tone and the implication of the statement that rubbed me the wrong way. It wasn’t unusual for people to question the cost of the BMW, but there was just something about how he said it that made me think he’d drive off in it given the opportunity.I really wanted to ask him why he reached out to me, of all people, to give him a ride home, but I kept my mouth shut for a majority of the ride. His presence made me incredibly uncomfortable and I couldn’t wait to get him home and get myself home.“I really appreciate you doing this, man,” he said, breaking the silence. “I really didn’t want to have to walk home.”“It’s cool, no worries.”“Do you do this often?” he laughed. “Give rides to strangers, I mean.”I shook my head. “Not usually, no.”Alan laughed again. “Probably for the best. You know, there’s a lot of crazies out here,” he said, in a dramatic, Joker-esque, sing-song manner. It made my stomach turn.Without skipping a beat, I retorted, “Yeah, you’re right. That’s why I keep a gun under my seat. You never know.”I looked at him in my peripheral vision and his expression was emotionless. He looked out of the window and remained quiet the entire remainder of the ride and didn’t look back at me once. As I neared his neighborhood, he pointed out an empty spot a few houses down from his.“You can just drop me off here, man, it’s cool,” he said, hurriedly.I obliged and threw the SUV in park. Alan immediately collected his backpack, said a quick thanks, and practically power-walked toward his house, disappearing into the driveway. I immediately shifted into gear and high-tailed it home.The moment I left his neighborhood, I felt this overwhelming sense of relief. I don’t think he caught on that I was bluffing about having a gun under the seat, but something tells me that the comment deterred him from whatever it was he originally planned to do.A few weeks later, I came home from work and my parents were watching the news. Alan’s mugshot was on Channel 6. He was arrested for brutally murdering a girl in our town after she’d picked him up and gave him a ride home. The girl, Allison, left her Facebook logged in on her laptop and her mother checked it when Allison wasn’t responding to text messages or phone calls. The police went to Alan’s house and found Allison’s grey Toyota, with her body in the trunk. Alan was arrested immediately, with Allison’s blood on his clothes and his hands. Inside Allison’s car on the passenger side was Alan’s backpack, which contained miscellaneous drugs and a bloody machete.I went to the bathroom and barely made it before I vomited. My entire life flashed before my eyes as I was collapsed over the toilet. I didn’t dare tell my parents that he was the “friend” I gave a ride to a few weeks prior. I did send an anonymous tip to the police about the occupants of the third floor apartment of 55 Spring Road, which led to the arrest of a handful of men and a collection of controlled substances.I can’t say what would have happened to me if I didn’t lie to Alan about having a gun under the seat of my car. What I can say is the fact that since that night, I do carry a gun now, and I’ve never given a ride to anyone I didn’t personally know. [info] None [info] 1581023115
Macca_321 [info] I'm on the very first day of giving up alcohol for good I've always had a bit of a tough relationship with alcohol. I would drink habitually and often, because I convinced myself it was my only way to relax. When I was with my ex boyfriend, we would often drink a bottle of wine each on a week night, and continue drinking when we got to the weekend. It wasn't healthy or right, but it was our way to 'relax'. But now, some years later, this has been wearing very thin for me. I was diagnosed with anxiety when my ex and I split, and since then, alcohol has only made me feel stressed, down and ill. So now, with a wonderfully positive boyfriend, I have decided to quit drinking. Last night was, frankly, the straw that broke the camels back, when I sat in a toilet cubicle silently crying to myself, after a boozy brunch with the girls. It doesn't make me feel like me. And I want to be properly happy again. Support would be appreciated, as I know it'll be a bumpy ride! [info] None [info] 1554633741

maq0r [info] Former blue badge here: no I didn't. Worked in retail, on the tech side of things. It was a ruthless environment where only whites and Asians would thrive and create their fiefdoms and kingdoms to go for that L6, L7+. Further, frugality is fine when you need to be conscious about resources you use, is another thing when SLU is being rebuilt from the ground up with 40 story high buildings and not one gym for the employees or subsidized food. "There's plenty of options around town" said Bezos during an all hands, but what they don't say is that most of the gyms and restaurants around campus are owned by Amazon execs so of course they're not going to offer anything for free. It felt too mining town for me. Also, crying under the desk? Yep, checked here, 11 hr days, sev2s (like FIX IT NOW tickets) left and right. I did NOT have a good time. "oh but it depends on team" sure, but the gym/food story isn't team dependant. I left a year ago when I was diagnosed with anxiety due to work. Can't recommend.  [info] None [info] 1528870578
RandomGenericName4 [info] I worked through an anxiety attack all on my own! I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back and even though I see a therapist I've struggled with it a lot since then especially when it comes to school. Today in class I guess the stress finally got to me and I got that feeling I usually do when I'm about to have an attack, so I excused myself to the bathroom (it was empty too!) and managed to calm down. Typically I have to be picked up early and my mom has to help me relax when I have my attacks (which I realise I need to grow out of) but this time I did it completely alone! Not as spectacular as others but I'm proud of myself for once. [info] None [info] 1569900060

kyaanureeves [info] I didn’t crack under pressure and cry today! It was my first day of high school EVER and I’m a very nervous person. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back and that hasn’t helped when it comes to meeting new people and trying to make it to class on time, speak in front of everyone, etc.I was SO prepared to cry that I packed tissues in my bag. But all of my worries were irrational. “What if I don’t make it to class on time?” I got to all of my classes with no issue. “What if I forget my locker combo?” I got in all four times with NO ISSUE!I was super glad to find that I could get through something really stressful without my natural response-fetal position, crying. I’m really proud of myself, which is rare for me. But hey, I could do it and that got me a lot more self-confidence. [info] None [info] 1567564139

AsaKurai [info] Hey, not that you're an expert, but is feeling "foggy" also a symptom? I definitely feel like insomnia, heart palpitations and feeling bloated have been prominent since I first felt like I was diagnosed with anxiety and I guess those symptoms come and go depending on when I take Xanax, but this foggy feeling has been persistent for weeks now. Almost feels like i'm tipsy or have done an all-nighter, but I kinda push through and go about my day anyway. I'm assuming it's because of my sleep? But I try at least on the weekends to catch up on that, just wondering if it's a symptom people go through... [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1535173681

becausepuppies [info] When I was about 17 my anxiety got really bad seemingly out of nowhere and I struggled really bad, in pretty much the same type of way you described.  Here's the good piece of advice that my mom told me: if you have the capability to think that you're going crazy, you're not going crazy.  People who actually "go crazy" aren't mentally capable of differentiating the way they're acting and what's actually normal.   You thinking you're going crazy is scary, I know because I've thought the same thing many times, but rest assured that it's just anxiety, not something more severe. Before I was diagnosed with anxiety I saw about a zillion different doctors because I just felt "weird" and I knew something was wrong but I couldn't describe it, that was the scariest part.  Once I was finally diagnosed with anxiety, I was able to educate myself and find ways to help myself.I won't lie, I struggled for years, some worse than others.  But my best advice is to educate yourself on anxiety, it's symptoms, and treatments as much as humanly possible and keep advocating yourself.  Don't let people tell you you're being dramatic or it's all in your head, and  most importantly DO NOT BE ASHAMED. You will get better, you will learn to manage the anxiety, and hopefully along the way you'll learn what I did - that more people than you realize struggle with anxiety in some form, and most people are willing to help you out if you just ask. You may have to go through a few therapists who you don't get any help from, but you will eventually find one that works for you.  Also, don't be afraid of medication--it's what really helped me out.   [info] None [info] 1471628038
LivingMeme101 [info] Anxiety, Passive, and Lack of Confidence.. Which should I fix first? Some things about myself that I have noticed lately is, when I'm in a situation that I'm in and should stand up for myself in some way, I don't do it. I just let the situation pass because I don't like confrontation. I've always had a lack of self confidence, ever since I was a kid. To make matters worse I've been diagnosed with anxiety since a very young age. I don't make decisions on something until I am 100% sure they are the right one. Well, that's what I tell myself I think, just so I don't have to deal with the situation. I also over think/overanalyze just about every situation. One example is this girl hung out with me before classes ended a few weeks ago.. Lets just say that she was into me and I didnt listen to my gut, which resulted in her moving on  after that and kind of ghosted me. I've been over thinking the situation since then, some days it won't even be a thought, other days it messes with me. Its something that happens to me every time an opportunity comes to me and I just let it pass.  I tend to beat myself up for stuff like this. I avoid making mistakes constantly, or try too.Anyways, what stuff would you guys try to fix first ? Felt like I was a little scattered with my writing. All of these problems seem to interconnect so I don't know exactly how to nip it in the bud. Thanks to everyone ahead of time! [info] None [info] 1527025716

"I  have had anxiety for 10 years"..Well maybe by then you should be trying to manage it / making a difference vs "I was diagnosed with anxiety in my 2nd year and as you can see by my transcript I've been improving my management of it".

Caliboy50124 [info] I'm kind of similar. Last year, I really enjoyed weed, then one day the day after smoking, I felt Dr. Thing was it didn't go away.  Months later I still "think " I have Dr, but only when I think about it. When I do things I never consider it there.  I've also thought I'm just paranoid and I convinced myself I had it ( I'm diagnosed with anxiety and I am the type of person to think he has a fatal disease from the slightest pain). Anyways I started smoking slowly a few months after and I'm fine. But I know how dp/Dr feels and I don't want anyone to experience it, especially the months I did. The only thing I can say is, and this worked for me, start smoking with a small amount, in a good environment, and if possible not alone. For me, getting high with friends takes away most of my paranoia and bad times during my high because you are having more fun and having a  conversation. Anyways, good luck, and if you do start smoking again, don't rush into it. Baby steps. [info] None [info] 1514349307
GiraffeJaf [info] HIPAA violation? Recently I went to a dermatologist for acne treatment. I ended up just seeing his RN, who wanted to put me on Accutane. After I agreed to it she got started on the process was asking me medical history questions, including mental health. I told her I was diagnosed with anxiety in the past. She then paused and told me I needed to see my psychiatrist and get permission from her before starting Accutane.  I complied and my psychiatrist told me it was fine. I thought that the nurse wanted my psych to send a note to the dermatology dept but then I found out that she instead went through my psychiatric health information to check if my doctor wrote anything down that would indicate if it was okay or not for me to take Accutane. Is it a violation of HIPAA for a nurse to access my medical records like this? I don’t feel comfortable having a derm nurse looking through my psych notes, but I’m not sure if it’s an actual violation.EDIT: I am located in California! [info] None [info] 1571161547

PaperCats4 [info] Finally went to see a doctor. I have celexa questions I thought the way I was feeling would go away on its own. I've never been depressed before but I've always been someone who is anxious. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder as a teenager. But, for the past two months it's like I've been living in a nightmare. I'm always tired. I feel numb most of the time but when I do feel emotion its irritability or intense hopelessness and fears of being stuck like this forever. I feel heavy and like I can't do anything I enjoy. Lately, even making and eating food has become a huge chore and I'm eat a lot less. I can't do my research or my writing and I fear what will happen when the semester starts, I go back to teaching, and I can barely get out of bed. People told me not to see a doctor. They said medications aren't the solution and that it will just mask my problems. Some have said that the meds change who you are as a person and that you become addicted. But, I feel so miserable that I finally bit the bullet and went to see someone. Herbs, essential oils, and yoga don't help. Someone told me to take up a hobby to cure my sadness but the thing is that this isn't sadness. I'm aware that I have a pretty good life. I have a career that I love and it pays well. I have a supportive and loving spouse, a house of my own, and three amazing cats. I have hobbies and friends. It's just that I can't enjoy any of these things lately.   Anyway, the doctor referred me to psychotherapy which I will definitely do. She also prescribed Celexa. I'm starting on 5mg per day for 2 weeks, then 10mg per day for 2 weeks, and then 20mg. However, I've sort of scared myself looking at side effects. I've read that it can cause fatal heart conditions, liver disease, libido loss, low salt levels in the blood, seizures, etc. How common are these side effects?   Also, my doctor said I can expect to notice some change at 4 weeks. Does that sound correct? What do I do until then? [info] None [info] 1564441808

corialis [info] Anyone else have major life changes as a trigger? I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of 9 after a big change (well, for a kid, anyway!) - I spent the summer at the babysitter's with 2 toddlers who wouldn't leave me alone when I was an only child and not used to kids at all. It was like my brain just short-circuited when confronted with such a drastic change.So far in my life I've had 2 more major meltdowns, one after I graduated high school and one when I moved to a brand new city for a brand new job. If I'm unprepared for such huge change it's even worse. The anxiety just takes over my life and I can't think of anything else! I'm okay with smaller changes, like when there was a semester change in high school or being moved to a new room at work. I'm moving this week for a new job, but the job is on another team in the same department, I've lived in that city before and I'm moving in my friend's apartment building. Hopefully I won't have a huge meltdown, but I still feel like this is consuming my life and I can't think about anything else. Bonus rant: So the last time I had a meltdown, a psychiatrist prescribed me clonazepam and quetiapine temporarily (I'm on Paxil maintenance) to help me make it through until I acclimatized. Those were life-savers! Anyway, this time around I was proactive in getting the prescriptions, but the psychiatrist would not give me clonazepam because I was moving and he wouldn't be able to monitor me. He told me that if I need it, go to a walk-in clinic. Seriously? I'm asking for the benzos to *prevent* a meltdown.  I would have lost my job last time if my boss wasn't so great. Why yes, let's tell the person with an anxiety disorder triggered by changes that she can't plan ahead to mitigate the change, that'll help! [info] None [info] 1439860454
rooroo999 [info] I feel like I've finally moved on from a girl that I tried and failed to start a relationship with. So I started talking to an old classmate that I had a minor crush on in high school. We made plans to go see a movie one night last week. I stayed up till eleven and never heard from her, and now she's avoiding me. On top of that, I'm getting tired of my current job in retail, but I can't find anything in my town that would be any better. I can't really afford to make a big move to another town though or to go to college without going into debt. On top of that, I think I have the onset of either thyroid problems or anemia, and I've been diagnosed with anxiety problems in the past.  My current insurance is crap, and l can't afford to pay out of pocket to see a doctor about it. I just kinda feel like I'm stuck. Like I graduated high school and am ready to move on in life, but I can't really get out of my current situation. My health is going downhill. My job is going nowhere. I'm 20, and I've never had a serious relationship. I just feel worthless right now... I don't feel like I'm living my life; I feel like I'm just waiting for it to end.  [info] None [info] 1537475852

address-unknown [info] I’m so sorry you’re going through this. This isn’t really advice, just an anecdote. I was diagnosed with anxiety as a very young teenager and took various benzodiazepines pretty regularly (never more or more frequently than prescribed) until I was in my early 20s. I went off of them due to headaches that gradually developed after taking them for several years. My dosage hadn’t increased, and it was consistent between Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin. Without fail, as soon as the effect of the benzo ended, I would get a CRUSHING headache. My GP and psychiatrist both insisted it wasn’t the benzos but were happy to help me get off of them. Immediate relief. I still get migraines but after that medication change and identifying a few triggers they’ve dropped from 1-3 per week to once a month. I still have an Ativan prescription because sometimes the beastly headache is better than the panic attack but I take it extremely sparingly.  [info] None [info] 1554311432

Omars-comin [info] Curious..did your doctor(s) specifically tell you that the reason they are skeptical of you is because they have so many other people claiming to have POTS/dysautonomia? Personally, I may have never gotten an official diagnosis if it hadn’t been for my own research and some level of self diagnosing. I’m actually shocked to see that some people have gotten diagnosed quickly/easily because that couldn’t be further from the case for me. I’ve been highly symptomatic since I was 11 years old, but I had no idea that POTS even existed until a few years ago (I’m currently 30). I had a fainting episode and wound up in the ER because I hit my head on my tile floor. I noticed that every time I went from lying down to sitting up in the hospital bed, the heart rate monitor started going off to alert the doctors that my hear rate had gone above 120bpm (no one checked on me). The next day, I typed in “tachycardia upon sitting up” into google, and POTS was the first thing to come up. I have since been diagnosed with EDS and POTS, nearly 20 years after becoming symptomatic. One issue is a lot of doctors aren’t referring people to get the proper testing done. I didn’t have any ANS testing done until I got insurance that doesn’t require referrals to specialists. I was never referred to anyone by my GP. I quite literally was my own doctor and referred myself and demanded the tests that I felt I needed. It’s not *our* job as patients to request specific referrals/tests based on our symptoms, but that’s the experience I had. My primary doctor(s) should have looked at my symptoms and told me **everything** I should get tested for based on those symptoms, but instead I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and sent on my way time after time. I feel that anxiety should only be diagnosed after tests are done to rule out any and all conditions (no matter how uncommon/unlikely said conditions are) that have similar physical symptoms. Unfortunately, that’s not typically how it goes. Anxiety is diagnosed despite no tests for other conditions being done. Actually, if I’m being honest, I don’t think primary care doctors should be diagnosing or treating anxiety anyway. Leave that to psychiatrists. I agree that people who have had *negative* testing should accept the fact that POTS/dysautonomia isn’t their issue and keep searching for other possibilities. I also agree that people shouldn’t necessarily be recommending specific medications to people who are undiagnosed, but at the end of the day, that person is going to have to see a doctor in order to obtain medication(s). I think the majority of POTS treatment is harmless and isn’t going to have any ill effects on people who don’t have POTS. There are *always* going to be illness fakers. There’s nothing that can be done about that. That doesn’t give ANY doctor the right to dismiss symptoms just because an illness is “trendy”. Doctors who are doing that need to be fired by the patient. Period. I actually think part of the reason this particular condition is so popular amongst fakers is because it is *known* to be misdiagnosed and get blown off by doctors. Perhaps if doctors took *everyone’s* symptoms seriously and did a better job at getting dysautonomia patients diagnosed in a timely manner, people would be less inclined to fake this condition.

Hexacorpus [info] [Help] Struggling with Anxiety &amp; Phobias I am 19 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety in late 2013, Asperger's in September 2014, and have gone through therapy for Emetophobia (which caused frequent anxiety/panic attacks and still affects me on a smaller scale after therapy).I'm due to see my therapist soon about Thanatophobia (fear of death) / Chronophobia (fear of the future - I don't think there's a better term?) / health anxiety.My therapist unofficially diagnosed me with health anxiety during my last therapy sessions, along with official diagnosis for social and GAD. My anxieties are contributing to and drawing from my Thanatophobia, Chronophobia, Emetophobia and God knows what.Since this is my first post, I thought I'd sort of introduce myself, because I'm not coping, at all, and I want to know if there are others with these phobias and mix of anxiety disorders.Does it get better?

Vadermaulkylo [info] Does this sound like a heart problem or a blood clot to any of you? So I’m 17, have always had a terrible diet, but am not overweight, and last month I noticed that the left side of my heat was hurting, so I freaked out. I went to the doctor and found that I had perfect blood pressure and pulse, so he sent me home. Two days later I felt a slight pain in my arm and panicked, so then sure enough I started having pains that shot down my left arm into my pinky, just like with a heart problem and rushed back to the doctor, where he did an EKG and found it to be “perfect” , so I was diagnosed with anxiety. Some time has gone by and it’s gotten worse and I’m feeling other symptoms, such as back pain, abdominal pain, extremely hard heart beats, fast heart beats, the pains I described before, and the main vein in my left hand is hurting very very bad, but it only started that when I noticed the vein slightly bulged a little(which I’m pretty sure it always has). I’ve had all those symptoms for weeks on in now. Then the other my parents called the doctors office and told them to test blood I had taken 4 months ago(another story there) and they did and found it to be normal, which I don’t think blood from 4 months ago would pick up on a heart problem or blood clot I may have gotten since, but oh well, my parents says it can. Now that hand pain I described earlier is hurting extremely badly and I’m worried it that I have a clot in that arm and that’s caused it to hurt right where that vein is. I went to a physical therapist who found a rib on the left side of my chest was poked out and she said that probably caused the pain to begin with and my anxiety made me start feeling all this other stuff, but that sill didn’t convince me. What do you guys think of this, I’m beyond scared and want to have an updated blood test but my parents are NOT happy, as the EKG was already pricey and came back just fine. It might just be very bad anxiety but you can never be too careful! [info] None [info] 1528465252

fuckthisthat [info] I HATED the call center. Gave me the worst anxiety ever. (This was Before I was diagnosed with anxiety and was on meds so it made it even worse.)I remember a lady I talked to. Can’t remember if it was inbound or outbound. She said that her dad screened and recorded every call made in the house and he would listen to them. It sounded like she was a prisoner in her own home. She had to go and asked if I’d be there when she called back. I had to tell her my “shift” was ending and I wouldn’t be speaking to her again.  [info] Satan's Victory [info] 1542835254
midget9 [info] Thanks for the reply1) Just had an MRI, waiting on results2) Each one varies slightly, but I'll walk you through the worst one I can remember.  I was driving when I felt it coming on, so I pulled off to a state park to go for a run and try to relax.  After running for about 10 or 20 minutes, I stop and am overlooking some water with my phone in my hand trying to take a picture.  Then I snapped my phone in half, threw it in the water, ran to my car, and drove till I was in the next state over.  My memory of it is spotty, but I do remember coming out of it about 4 hours away from home, and I turn around and a second wave hit me as I was driving back.  The only thoughts I had were "I want this to stop" and I ended up driving to my mother's house in hopes of her being able to talk me down, but as always no luck, so I drove to a hospital, checked myself in, and they put me in a room where I sat on the ground shaking for about 2 hours until the doctor comes in and diagnoses me with anxiety, injects me with something they say is stronger than xanax(I do now know what it is), and send me on my way. I guess the closest thing I could relate one of these at the peak of its severity is the incredible Hulk, as frustration/anger can bring it on, and I can't really stop it when it's going and sometimes I am filled with pure rage.  I remember having many thoughts and strong pulls to drive my car into oncoming, to stab myself, and pretty much any other opportunity I saw to end my life, which is not characteristic of me at all outside of these episodes.  I do have enough sense in these to resist these urges, however, as I am smart enough to realize that it will pass.  I apologize for the disorganized story, I'm not the best at formatting.3) I have not. The one I am in now has been spent in bed.4) I have been diagnosed with anxiety, mayo clinic diagnosed me with constipation, one therapist considered a weird form of schitzophrenia, other doctors have attempted to diagnose me with ADD, ADHD, Bipolar Disorder,  and currently epilepsy.  5) I usually smoked whatever strain I could get my hands on, but the best I remember was called Blue Dream. Others included Black Widow, Pineapple, and Purple Diesel.  Again, thank you for taking the time to read/reply to my post. [info] None [info] 1417557247
cheekybrat [info] Is it anxiety or just plain old worry? I’m going to try to make this quick as I’ve just taken a sleeping pill and I’ll start hallucinating soon.Both of my parents are in the hospital.  My dad, 83, had pneumonia.  My mom, 68, can’t take care of herself.I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 26, and am now 38.  I am on 15mgs of cipralex and have been for the last two years.I am experiencing more anxiety now due to my parents being in the hospital.  Some days are better than others.  Sometimes I feel good.  Sometimes I have a pit in my stomach but try to stay positive.  Sometimes I’m so anxious I can’t eat and have trouble sleeping.I’m seeing my doctor next week and will discuss this with her.  I don’t want to increase the dosage because I feel like this anxiety is warranted.  My mind isn’t blowing it out of proportion.  But if I did increase, would that gnawing sensation in my stomach go away?  Would I still worry, but not wallow?  What can I do otherwise to minimize the anxiety, without medication?

ferdous12345 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety by my general physician, but I was 14/15 and it was mostly about my stress level and my constant worrying. He said that I should look into non-medicinal relievers, like showering. Needless to say, it hasn't helped in the long run. I kinda just want to try medications. I know it sounds bad, because medication isn't magic or whatever, but I'd like to at least try to feel normal. Deep breathing doesn't always work. I can't leave class and take a shower. I can't stop in the middle of the road to meditate. I just want a chance to feel like a functional human who doesn't need to go through a list of techniques to alleviate 1/5 of my anxiety. But maybe it's selfish of me, and I know medication isn't a walk in the park. I know it can take months to find the right dosage. I know the side effects could be worse than the symptoms.

Stell2020 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety as a child, you sound similar to me study wise, I had to work so much more than my peers to achieve the same grades (I did well but man I worked and worked). Hit my mid 20’s and life became too much (maintaining a home, sustaining a job, attempting to cook every night, exercise, then have enough energy and motivation to socialise or at least be pleasant and intimate with my husband). I went to a therapist because I was sure I was depressed, she suggested adhd (to which I laughed, come on I wasn’t that hyperactive kid who was always in trouble and failing school), saw a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with adhd, started stimulant medication (to which I was worried would increase my anxiety) and within 2 months my anxiety had all but gone! Treat the adhd, so I’m organised, can prioritise, and enjoy life, bye bye anxiety! (It does still effect me when I’m overly stressed/ busy but so much better than before). There is success either way you go, just depends what you and your therapist believe is having the bigger impact on your life.  [info] None [info] 1553320770

tragicinsecurities [info] Geppetto is out of state for work and I made JYDad cry Anytime Geppetto goes out of state or town for work, I call my JYDad a few times during the leave so he’s less lonely and we can talk one on one since Geppetto never shares my news with him. This won’t be a long post as I haven’t had any new drama with her and I’ve been feeling too raw to do more background posts while I’m already stressing over work and personal issues every day. After reading some of my old posts, j started feeling guilty about writing about my mother’s abuse towards me for some reason? Like I know I’m just chronicling the abuse I endured but I also feel bad telling a bunch of strangers on the internet about it bc despite the abuse, I had a relatively good(?) childhood despite the abuse and enmeshment.Anyways. So I was talking to dad about everything in my life, the good and bad, when I told him I’m getting a medical cannabis card. Cue jealousy and a short story of how my mom wouldn’t let him buy an edible when they were on vacation in Europe and also how the hell do I qualify for my medical card but he with arthritis can’t. So I told him I was diagnosed with anxiety and ptsd. Cue confusion. Where did I get my ptsd? Well from mom of course.My poor dad had to relive all the abuse he had no idea about bc after the first incident when she slammed my head on the glass dining room table over spilled spaghetti, he told her if she ever touched me again, she was out of his house(not that he would do that bc that meant she’d take me with me; at this point of the glass table story, I was 5 and a fresh immigrant and my dad was not married to my mom and had no legal claim to me bc he wasn’t my birth father although he is the only father figure I recognize and acknowledge). So my mother, not one to bow down to anyone telling her what to do, started her abuse behind his back.I didn’t tell him every time she hit me or even the gravity of the things she said to me, bc I’m pretty sure if I told him about the abortion comment now, he’d die of a stroke. So he got very upset and telling me he was sorry for not stepping up and doing better. I told him I did not blame him for any of it and that he was doing the best he could under the shrouded circumstances. Then he told me something that shocked me - ever since the children left the nest, their relationship has gotten better. My mom still has her anger issues but he doesn’t give a shit and ignores her so it doesn’t impact him as much whereas when we lived with our parents, her anger and frustrations she would take out on us. So I asked my dad, well what changed? His answer deadass was: we no longer have to fight over parenting styles.Glad my brother and I were literal punching bags bc mom couldn’t figure out how to parent without abusing us. I suspect her own childhood trauma and undiagnosed PPDs played a much larger role in how she raised us but quite frankly I’m not in a position to ask her because I haven’t forgiven her yet for what she put us through.

daisiesandink [info] After nearly 2 years NC, a letter came in the mail... I've been NC with my parents since early 2017. After a lot of self-reflection and therapy, I've grown to now finally be able to call what they put me through abuse (in all senses of the word). I've been diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD over everything, but despite this, have been functioning to the best of my ability to pick my life back up again and move forward. In my last conversation with them I told them the reasons for NC, and informed them to stop contacting my husband and I.Over the years my mother has sent cards filled with money. She used to do the same to me and my siblings with previous attempts at NC- it was her way of trying to bribe me back into her life. In these cards she never wrote anything malicious (she's too clever for that)- just a simple "miss you". It used to really bother me, but now not as much. Once I donated the cash to a child abuse charity. Another year I went on a Christmas shopping spree. But deep down I knew, I'd get ["the letter"](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/3wlz3t/how_to_deal_with_the_dreaded_letter_what_it/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=u_daisiesandink) one day. Today was that day.I more-so would like to just share it and get feedback on the ridiculousness of the letter. It's left me shaken, annoyed, angry, depressed, anxious, and somewhat questioning myself, even though I logically know I shouldn't. Here it is (shortened and names excluded for anonymity):&gt;I hope this letter finds you well. I really do hope so. It's been so long since I've spoken to you.  &gt;  &gt;I wanted to let you know the news before you hear it from anyone else. We've decided to move out of state. How can we do that while I'm still working? In June of last year I injured my shoulder and have been out of work since then. ***(I shortened this drastically! My mother spent 5 paragraphs explaining how this injury occurred.)***  &gt;  &gt;Dad and I have been traveling to the doctor and it seems his cancer has gotten worse. He's no longer eligible for the medical treatment he used to get, so we were hoping he'd be eligible for a new drug. Unfortunately, he wasn't, but he seems pretty optimistic about another new medication he's being put on. When we move, the doctors at this new medical treatment center will be taking on his treatment, so we're looking forward to that.  &gt;  &gt;As far as the move goes, we've found a piece of property in XYZ ***(omitted location for anonymity)*** and are having a house build. We'd found a house elsewhere, but it would have a lot of traffic. The contractor says the house will be complete in 2019, so we'll be putting our current house up for sale soon. We wanted to keep the house and let you guys live in it. Let us know if you'd like to do this. ***(WTF?)***  &gt;  &gt;Also, I just wanted to let you know that I put a stop on last year's Christmas check. ***(She sent check instead of cash- I shredded it)*** I was worried it would be stolen last year and didn't want to risk it, so that's why I chose not to send cash. Since it hasn't been cashed, I don't know if you received it or not. So I'm enclosing cash in this letter to replace it, and decided to send this with tracking so I'll know you've received it. ***(I may be reading into it too much, but this creeps me out)*** I'm also enclosing this year's Christmas card and money.  &gt;  &gt;Also, I have massages on my account at the spa. I'm not using them, so I had them transfer them over to your account. ***(I don't have an account anymore so I'm not sure how she did this, if she did it at all)*** If your husband would like some, I can transfer some to him too. Just let me know.  &gt;  &gt;I think about you and miss you. I respect your wishes to keep my distance, however, I hope someday you show up on my doorstep to give me a hug.The things I've taken away from this so-far:* No apologies, no acknowledgements of the abuse* She's putting the burden on me to make amends and rectify the situation (which I don't want- I just want her to stop contacting me)* She says she respects my wishes for her to keep her distance, but if she did then she wouldn't be sending me the letter in the first place&amp;#x200B; [info] ACoN | NC with both parents since 2017 [info] 1540500873

InnerMattDemons [info] Contrast:I have been diagnosed with anxiety for around 11 years by now. I've been working on managing it for all those 11 years, with mixed effect.I know I'm "wrong" - in that I'm unable to do a lot of things that should be simple. I hate myself for this. Truly, deep down inside hate myself, for being unable to do so many basic things. I don't want to bother people, so when it's bad I have a really hard time reaching out. I just isolate myself and feel lonely, wishing I could get away from the constant bombardment of thoughts about how awful I am, and how many things I cannot do.So, I'm working on trying to accept myself more. Not hate myself for my flaws and limitations. Not hit myself in the head with all the simple things I cannot get myself to do.Stuff isn't always easy to fix. God knows I'd love to not feel this way; I go to weekly therapy, have listened to innumerable audiobooks, lectures, YouTube videos, ... about it.I'd love to be able to fix it that easily. I haven't managed in 11 years.So, I'm sorry for trying to embrace it and not hate myself for once. No one wants to feel this way, and it isn't always easy to fix.---More constructively: If you see someone who is clearly holding themself in a destructive or dysfunctional pattern, perhaps they don't know how to break it. Perhaps they just don't know how to do it in a better way. Perhaps they get overwhelmed by trying to change it. There can be a myriad of reasons.Rather than look down on them for not fixing it, you might consider talking to them about it. Perhaps even offer to help them with it. That way lies progress; not in judging someone for the things they have a hard time with. [info] None [info] 1556531824
JoyfulStingray [info] Yes.  I had one and found a different workplace.For 3 years, I had a job in a very high paced environment with a bunch of military guys.  If they told you that they needed that product in 3 hours, you had better have it done in 2.5 and NOT BE LATE.That kind of anxiety to give a worthwhile product in such short amount of time was crippling.  I went to the bathroom and just cried or tried to calm down from a panic attack.I started medication when my SO said that I wasn't like myself and I was diagnosed with anxiety.  Medication helped, but finding a slower paced work environment worked wonders.

ghghyrtrtr [info] Same here with the faking being sick. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, acid reflux (get my first endoscopy this year to determine the damage due to years of no treatment, it was so bad when I first had it diagnosed in my early 20s the doctor thought I had asthma because of the wheezing), anemia (woohoo for headaches caused by lack of blood), severely allgeric animals (grew up with constant hives to the point I of bruising and trouble breathing but never taken to a doctor, I really thought it was normal to pop benadryl  when your kneck and face were swelling up). I was always just being dramatic!! Oh and when I really needed medical treatment- why didn't I say something? They seriously didn't take me to the dentist until I refused to eat. I had told them when I chipped the tooth, gone through two tubes of numbing stuff that they bought because of tooth pain, had had a headache for two weeks that I told them about. Hmmm how is that not speaking up. Complaining about pain for a month. Then they made me feel guilty about having a $300 filling that was done with minimal novacaine because they refused to pay extra to take me to the pediatric dentist. The dentist was apologetic because he thought I really should have pain meds but he couldn't prescribe them. My tooth needed to be treated or I'd end up loosing it through surgery because it wasn't grown in all the way. He drilled all the way to the root, cleaned the root and filled. He said he didn't know if it would grow in and need a root canal or just need to be pulled out via surgery.  When my dentist I went to as an adult saw it he was horrified to hear that I wasn't on pain meds and only novicain when they did the work. When I was referred to a specialist for the root canal he was horrified too. This was after both had looked at the X-ray and assumed I had been put out for it. Nope white knuckled through the pain. Feeling guilty for costing so much money and knowing if I couldn't handle it I'd have to go get surgery to have the tooth pulled and my parents' didn't have the money. [info] None [info] 1533784822

DrunkenMechanic [info] getting PA medical card Looking to get the medical card in Pennsylvania but have some questions. I guess the first one would be will they even give it to me? I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2015 and was prescribed medications for about a year then I couldn't afford the doctor anymore. I also really didn't like the medications I was on as I had many side effects. So I haven't been to a doctor for that in a while so I don't know if that would count. I also over the past year or so have had pretty bad back pain that comes and goes. I threw out my back pretty bad last year I went to an urgicare for it but they just sent me home with something like ibuprofin. My boss paid for me to go see a chiropractor a few times which got me back to being able to function again but my back still hurts often and has not been right since then. Would either of these be good enough to get my card?  Also I see you can apply online, someone on here recommended [quickmedcards.com](https://quickmedcards.com) but can you really get it through there? i see the card cost is $50 but how much does it cost through them I don't see that anywhere?

CSnare [info] Apparently I have anxiety So I was enrolling for university and I had to send them my immunization records. On my health record they list that, plus some “ongoing issues.” And one of these ongoing issues was apparently anxiety disorder.So that’s been there since 2016, but no one bothered to tell me I had been diagnosed with anxiety? I had NO idea, for real.I’ve never had a panic attack, but I do worry a lot. I thought the worrying thing was normal. Even the not being able to get out of bed at night out of fear there would be an intruder standing outside my door kind of worrying.Not even my parents bothered to tell me I was diagnosed with anxiety. But I’m not surprised to be fair, my dad doesn’t like the stigma of mental disorders, every time I bring it up he shoots it down.That’s all I really have to say lol.TL;DR I was diagnosed with anxiety and had no idea, and I thought the amount of worrying I did was completely normal.

totoro_7 [info] Thanks a lot for your interest in my case!&gt;I don't think there's mucus in the stool but I never checked properly. &gt; Almost all episodes (except one) have happened at nighttime, after I'd eaten dinner and was already lying in bed. &gt;Never tried keeping a food journal. Episodes have happened after eating big and small meals, with and without lactosis, with and without gluten, etc. They once happened straight after eating just a soy yoghurt.&gt;No accid reflux but excessive fatigue is definitely present. I need 9-10 hours of sleep in order to feel rested (and still sometimes don't). I have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder about 8 years ago. &gt;Episodes are very irregular and unpredictable. Last year, I had about 6 episodes over the course of 10 weeks. Then they were completely gone for over a year. Had an episode last May, nothing since. &gt; No weight loss, abdominal pain is only present during episodes, blood in stool happened twice, the morning after an episode. &gt; I had my stool tested six months ago, but I'm not sure what they tested for. I remember the only positive thing was Escheria Coli. The test was done shorly after an episode and after a week of taking Flagyl and Oflocet. &gt; No fevers, no eye redness, no joint pains, some mouth ulcers but not often. &gt; Stool looks solid and brow, not greasy. Frequent gassiness, frequent bloating, frequent gurgling sounds. &gt; I have had iron deficiency anemia twice before, it was attributed to my vegetarian diet. &gt; Haven't tried completely eliminating lactose not gluten nor sorbitol. Doctor said he didn't think it was food-related. &gt; Still have my gallbladder. &gt; No swollen lymph nodes (that I notice).&gt; Never travelled outside of Europe.&gt; No HIV.&gt; No stool incontinence.&gt; No history of bowel disease in the family. &gt; No known thyroid issues. &gt; They did biopsies during the colonoscopies. I don't know the results.  [info] This user has not yet been verified. [info] 1511881166
jeremyfirth [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADD. My doctor prescribed wellbutrin to see if it would help with both. It helped a lot with the anxiety, but not so much with the ADD. after a month of that, I talked to my doctor about it and he kept me on wellbutrin, but added methylphenidate ER for the ADD. i think I've lucked out and found a really effective treatment on our first try. My life is considerably less frenetic and overwhelming. I feel so much better, and I feel so much more control over myself. It's very empowering. [info] None [info] 1410625435

xrked [info] How do you deal with RSD? I’ve recently been learning more about RSD and how it’s affected me since I was a young child. To put a background on it- I had such severe anxiety about rejection and social situations even though I was extroverted that I was diagnosed with anxiety.Looking back I think the symptom could have been treated better by understanding it was a side effect of ADHD.I’m now an adult and really looking for other ways to help myself realize that my brain is hypersensitive to these issues [info] None [info] 1553002247

divinecore [info] Physical appearance, usually. And yes, I do get worried that I might owe them something or that I’m leading them on simply by being nice to them :( or that they have ulterior motives. It makes me want to go home and lie down. I have been diagnosed with anxiety before. Not sure if I just don’t like that kind of attention. I’m fine with attention if it’s because I’m being funny, though. I get scared that people might get too close to me. It just makes me sad for a reason I can’t explain! [info] None [info] 1528085283
ChickenPupper [info] I'm a POS HLM My SO has denied me sex for a year since I don't clean everyday or earn as much as her. I don't have a drivers licence and I'm unemployed. She says her friends tell her that it's understandable that she withholds sex and tell her to leave me. She also today said that I'm mentally abusive.She's a person that thinks that problems in relationship lead to no sex, while I think that no sex leads to problems in relationship. She is depressed also.Now the reasons for these things comes from the beginning. I stayed a lot at her place when we didn't live together and she wanted me to clean there or pay rent. I was diagnosed with anxiety that year. I didn't want to pay rent since I didn't live there amd she wanted me there, but cleaning was tough since coping with anxiety wasn't easy Also we did have sex then and my anxiety medicine made me LL and she really made me feel bad about it, so I stopped taking the medication to regain libido.Then she found a place really far out in a small town, which was affordable and had space for us. So I decided to move there to make her happier. Now I didn't have a license and getting one is difficult while having anxiety. The busses have poor connections over here. Now it's really hard to get work without having a car out here. I'm in a program where I do carpentry and sorts for 5 hours a day from wed to fri. I get paid for this and I pay half the rent and the internet. It's still only half of what she earns. She pays her half and also our home insurance. But she feels that I don't appreciate her enough and don't do enough around the house. This is why she doesn't have sex with me and doesn't desire me. Now I have tried to reach terms and do as she asks but I can only keep it up (no pun intended) for a week or two and she won't have sex with me ever. It was my birthday yesterday and the last time I had sex was last year on my birthday. I tried to ask her to have sex with me to make me feel like 10x better and maybe that would motivate me to keep the pace up and hopefully fix our db. But she just won't do it.When I do get stuff done she rewards me with not fighting and arguing as much and hugging or being near me.The reason why she called me mentally abusive was today while arguing with her, I said that maybe I'll have to take advice from this subreddit and leave her. She said it sounded like blackmail and it is abusive to say.Now I really don't know if I actually am a POS or does she just make me out to be one. Right now I feel like crap and don't know if I should apologize to her for saying that I might take your advice or what...Thanks if you read all this and sorry for no tl;dr.EDIT: I also wanted to mention that me moving away from my friends and family to near her family and friends means nothing to her since I did it myself and wasn't forced with a gun to my head.EDIT 2: Forgot to tell that I cheated on my SO by kissing a girl and texting with said girl. This made my SO not want sex even more. [info] None [info] 1530660757
Leopandas [info] As an adult, I've been diagnosed with ASD. Very mild. As a child I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Not to dismiss people on the ASD spectrum but having been in classes with children on the severe side of the spectrum.. as we were all grouped in the same class... what used to be called classic autism is nothing like the disabilities I had/have and they dealt with a lot more severe issues. That said, mild autism isn't a joy ride either as I still have meltdowns but sometimes I think classifying both as the same makes people not understand 'autism' has always been around and aspergers or mild autism isn't the worst thing that can happen to your child.

Willow_Queen [info] I (18f) is away from home for 2 weeks staying with boyfriend’s (22m) family and need help managing my anxiety from being away from home Hello everyone! I guess I should start with some back story to give you a better picture. (Also sorry for and grammar issues as English was never my strong point in school even though it’s my first language)Anyways I was diagnosed with anxiety about 2 years ago but had it ever since I was a child. I’m taking medication for my anxiety but it doesn’t seem to help too much. I also have disability called dystonia which came on at the age of 5; it basically renders my right side completely useless. My family life isn’t amazing either as my dad has narcissistic tendency. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 3 months now and we drove up to Idaho from California to stay with his dad’s side of the family for Christmas and New Years. I’ve met his dad and step mom once before this so I am nervous about staying with them especially so far away from home. Last time I traveled far away from home was to my long distance boyfriend(now ex) who lived in Florida for my 18th birthday and that didn’t go so well as his family was very mean to me and I just didn’t feel welcomed. My current boyfriend is really understanding about all this which I’m thankful for but I do want to him proud of me by not freezing up when someone asks me a basic question like “what do want to eat?” How can I get through these 2 weeks and be as social as I can without breaking down? Anything helps. Thanks in advance! [info] None [info] 1577118531

orangemochafrap17 [info] Like I said, I don't think the two are exclusive, but anxiety should be treated with therapy, it's not a personality trait, it's an illness that holds you back. Not wanting to interact is far different to being **afraid** to interact.As much as introverts like alone time, humans are social animals, we need it to SOME extent, no matter how slight. You're talking about a minority of introverts who actually need that much alone time, compared to a large number of people with anxiety, that again, gets mixed up with introversion on this sub a lot.I don't think it's perfectly understandable for **anyone** to have no friends at all, it's in our nature to want human contact to SOME extent. Very few people are that introverted that they can't have friends, I'm going off the majority here.It's not that they shouldn't be in this community, it's that they mightnt actually be introverted, if they are solely fearing social interactions, they might very well be extraverted but have anxiety.I thought I was very introverted for years, but then I was diagnosed with anxiety, as I learned to manage it I realised I actually enjoyed social events sometimes, but I did still need to be alone most of the time. A lot of people mix the two up, or conflate them together like they come hand in hand, they don't, you're not stuck with anxiety, thats why I tell people if I think they actually have it, because I don't want to think of them going they're whole lives misattributing anxiety as some uncontrollable part of their personality.

lbart00 [info] I [19f] am constantly feeling like I'm annoying my boyfriend [19m] of two months. I apologize all the time, and it is affecting us. Help? TL;DR I ask my boyfriend if I'm annoying all the time, and that's what's actually annoying. I don't know how to stop. It's multiple times within the hour, very frequently.Disclaimer as well: I've been diagnosed with anxiety, so I know it stems from that, so no need to let me know. EDIT: I am not looking for professional help or otherwise lengthy psychological assistance. I would just like some advice or encouragement, or to know if someone has been through this. I know it's a personal insecurity issue I need to work on, but I don't know what to do about it in the everyday.My boyfriend is a great man, and treats me better than I ever have been before. Maybe that's why I'm so insecure about our relationship? I care about him greatly and treasure my time with him. But I always ruin it with my *incessant apologizing*. I've been in some (a lot) of abusive relationships and toxic relationships in the past, so I have some (a lot) of baggage. One ex who particularly messed me up had me constantly saying sorry for the way I said things, the way I did things, the way I unintentionally made him feel, even apologizing for being upset myself. I once had to apologize for hours to *him* because I self harmed. When this ex gave me certain looks, texts, or behaviors I knew I was in trouble and I would start apologizing instantly. It was like when you did something wrong and your parents found out, except all the time if I did *anything*. This has impacted me greatly, likely for life.I've also been bullied in the past and was very suicidal in high school because people told me how shittily annoying I was. This, along with a few other situations and some past friendships, have me in a constant fear of being annoying or rude.I am saying "sorry"s all the time or asking my boyfriend if I'm being annoying (just by existing). I know it takes a pretty big toll on him and our relationship. Still, he is very kind and willing to validate me as he understands I've been abused in the past. He always says "if you were being annoying or I had an issue, I'd just tell you- I promise". I trust him, but I just get a... vibe. Or something. I don't know.I know it's unfair to him, but sometimes the residual fear from exes' "vibes" when they were mad at me think that when he acts that way he's annoyed. Hint: he's not. Sometimes he enjoys just listening, or he has ADHD so he's on his phone instead of looking at me and honestly doesn't know. I know that he is not my exes, but the behaviors that once caused automatic fear still do, even with someone else.What it basically is is that I *know* this is annoying, I *know* it could ruin our great relationship, I am *completely conscious* of me doing this toxic behavior, and I can't stop. It's obsessive sometimes. I apologize for doing things he hadn't even noticed me do, like stepping in front of him. I don't even know how to stop.I care about him so much and don't want to ruin our relationship. I am conscious of my behavior being toxic and unhealthy, I just have no idea how to stop it. I don't know how to believe he would "just tell me" if he doesn't want to be with me or is irritated by me. Help or experience with this is greatly appreciated. [info] None [info] 1553579547

ageekyninja [info] As someone with both disorders, ADD and anxiety have similarities but ADD doesnt cause you to be super nervous to the same extent anxiety disorder does. ADD causes nervousness and irritability for different reasons, especially if its sensory related. Anxiety itself is a bit of a different ballgame. Anxiety is just plain nervousness for no reason. ADD interacts with that in how it distracts me and how it effects me handling it but doesnt cause it. So its really a matter if your experience is something like that where you are irrationally nervous about a lot of things or if this is just one insecurity you have. If its just a matter of insecurity in relationships thats a different issue of course.Any time I was tested for ADD the doctor was only ever focused on what he was specifically testing for, not what other problems might exist. Like the doctor would suspect ADD and so he would just focus on if the test would confirm it. At least thats my experience. It wasnt until later that I was diagnosed with anxiety and that was after specifically asking the doctor about those specific symptoms. [info] None [info] 1523833300
georgialouisej [info] No, I wish he would have. I was very young and had (at the time) undiagnosed anxiety. Our relationship didn't start out terrible, at first he was lovely and all that but after a while he started to become controlling and manipulative which is awful anyway but worse for me at the time due to previously mentioned anxiety problems. After finding out he had cheated on me I tried to break up with him but he threatened to kill himself so I stayed. His behaviour then got worse by tenfold and he would openly do terrible things but I would stay because I thought that if I left and he killed himself it would be my fault. About 6 months before I broke up with him I was diagnosed with anxiety and started receiving treatment, we broke up after he did some extremely awful things and I finally realised that if he did kill himself, while that would be terrible, I am not responsible for his actions and it wouldn't be my fault.

tinybluesock [info] I made an appointment to see the doctor.. ...and I’m so scared.  All I feel is angry or scared or sad.  For over a month now.  Before that I had a period of feeling amazing...everything was spotless, I was up on all my reading, I hardly slept and got everything done!  I was productive!  Then... it just stopped.  I stayed in bed all day and skipped classes.  I yelled at my son.  I yelled at my SO, I yelled at myself.  I feel like I just cycle through “everything is awesome!  I am the most productive!” And “everything is shit, I fucking suck!”.  It’s been like that as long as I can remember.  My mother used to tell me I was such a drama queen and needed to grow up.  When I was in high school I was diagnosed with anxiety and possible ocd... but my treatment ended and I still had this flip-flop with no in between stage of “things are going well but I’m not insanely pumped”.  I’m never just... living, im always needing to do all the things, or none of the things.  I always believed that my mother was right and i was a crazy drama queen but I’m starting to think that if I know I’m a drama queen.. shouldn’t I be able to chill a little?  I feel like I don’t have any balance in my life... everything is one extreme or the other, never just...  the grey area?  I guess.. I don’t really know how to explain it and I’m worried my doctor won’t understand.  Or worse, he’ll confirm what my mother said and tell me to grow the fuck up... anyone else ever felt this way?  I feel like I’m crazy.  I feel like I’m realizing that all the things I’ve started and failed (in school mostly but also in relationships, sports...etc) always ends because I hit my “sad phase”.  My SO commented that he thought I should see a doctor, and I took one of those online tests from some Canadian psychology centre and it said I have like a really high chance of having some kind of mood issue so.... I’m kind of hoping I do.  I think it would be nice to be able to feel solid and to be able to function and succeed at stuff :/.  Then again, maybe I just need to work harder?  Sorry this is so long and rambley .... I’m just kind of freaking out, I feel like I’m just a big baby who needs to put on her big girl pants... but then again if I’ve tried that for well over a decade and it hasn’t helped maybe I do need to see the doctor?

vandalizmmm [info] Suffering from scruples again. I've suffered from scrupulosity for the past 11 or so years. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I have sought treatment and thought I was doing better, as I was able to space out my confessions and be more confident in deciding whether or not I should go to confession. However, today I panicked a little over something. I watched a YouTube video that critiqued a certain YouTuber for faking the use of an ouija board for clickbait. The video then showed clips of the aforementioned youtuber's clickbait video. It seemed like the whole thing was faked so I thought there wouldn't be any harm in me watching a silly YouTube critique, but now I'm questioning that. I stopped watching the video and didn't finish it.If I'm questioning whether or not I've sinned, it's a venial sin, right? Should I be super concerned about this? Or should I just try to stay calm and avoid these types of videos in the future? Most importantly, how can a scrupulous person like me overcome these types of "relapses"? I'm tired of being so stressed out over these types of things and would appreciate any help and advice. [info] None [info] 1557855952

faruins [info] Should I quit due to my anxiety worsening? I’m really at a loss here. I’ve been working casual hours (even though I’m technically hired as a part time RN) on an orthopaedic surgical floor for the last six months. During this time, I was diagnosed with anxiety and essentially just feel it getting worse and worse. My doctor has even said I appear to be worse and has since upped my medication and I’ve been coming back to check in with her every two weeks. A part of me knows that bedside nursing isn’t for me but because I’m a recent new grad, I know without gaining hospital bedside skills I won’t be able to apply to jobs outside of the hospital. Hence feeling so conflicted. I mean maybe bedside nursing could work for me but I’ve yet to find the right fit. The staff are nice and supportive on this floor, but I can’t see myself working there long term.I had a talk with my family and boyfriend and they’ve even suggested I quit my job now and just look for other positions. It kind of surprised me because they’ve been encouraging me to stick it out and to keep trying but I guess at this point, even to them I don’t seem to be improving and with the few shifts I work, I may be better off finding another job? I constantly feel ill and have GI issues, I don’t sleep through the night well and wake up a lot, I wake up with my heart racing, and the list goes on. It’s just affecting my daily living and I feel like a phoney. I keep being told how I feel is normal for a new nurse but I don’t know how much longer I can continue feeling like this. Because I work so few and far between, I’m a recognizable face on my floor but I don’t really know anyone and they don’t know me. I haven’t even met the new floor manager either so I feel like I can’t bring myself to let them know how I’ve been feeling. My sister who works in healthcare has said to not bother due her own personal experiences which have been negative. Any nurses with anxiety or anyone in general, if you can just give me advice.

hollywoodshowbox [info] Believe it or not I was diagnosed as being in a depressive state three weeks ago. I suffered from disordered eating habits (reading: anorexia &amp; bulimia, not at the same time) for four years (recovered now for a little over a year). I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder... last year? My motivation is to be the best possible version of myself (BPVoM), whatever that is. Sitting on my ass crying because life didn't work out the way I thought it would is *not* something the BPVoM would do. Moping about in an eternal grey is *not* something the BPVoM would do. It's really, really hard to develop this attitude and has taken a while to turn it into a habit -- but now that I've locked it in... it's just easier to cope with shit, you know? Find whatever works for you and go off of that. I was never a believer in the "one size/rule/belief fits all" thing. Discover a philosophy, mission, whathaveyou -- and make it your own. Good luck!

highestbird [info] Double vision occurs after pushups, during sex, morning Age: 30Sex: MHeight:  5'10''Weight:  148lbsRace: WhiteDuration:  1 yearMy health:  I have been diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks.  I used anti-anxiety medicine in the past but haven't for the past 5 years.  I remember 7 years ago I had weird blurry vision problems that wouldn't go away.  The blurry vision went away on its own.  I also had weird "circulation" issues in my legs, arms but apparently not a vascular problem.  It went away too 7 years ago.  I do sometimes feel chest pain which has been an on-going thing since I was 13.  I went to the ER a few times 5 years ago because of the chest pain, they did some tests, all normal.Symptoms: Double visionStory:I started drinking coffee regularly last year. Maybe about 2-3 cups a day for a month last Oct.  Mind you, I never was a coffee drinker before this.  After one month, I was sitting at my computer and all of a sudden I got double vision out of no where.  I immediately stopped drinking caffeine and it got better.  BUT, throughout the year, I would have a drink that has caffeine in it, and after 2 days the double vision would come back. I would stop again and it would go away.  Did this maybe 4-5 times last year and the same thing would happen.In Sept '15 there was a wedding I went to and had soda with caffeine in it along with alcohol. Since then I have been having double vision whenever I workout/push ups and even during sex.  Seems to happen when I do something strenuous.  After the double vision happens I usually have a headache afterwards.  My face/head feels really warm with pressure.  I'm already seeing a doctor and had my blood tested along with a CT scan.  Apparently they were all normal.Still trying to figure out what is wrong with me.Edit:  I don't smoke and I rarely drink alcohol.  I have been clean from caffeine for a month.

rcbarr94 [info] It’s possible that you have anxiety. I’m constantly obsessing over whether people actually like me or if they just pretend and then say rude/mean things behind my back. I was diagnosed with anxiety and started seeing a therapist and I’ve been working on it. It’s hard to let it go but you have to learn to let yourself be okay with people not liking you because not every person in the world is going to get along and that’s okay. There are people that I don’t like but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re bad people. So I try to think of the reverse. There are people who won’t like me but that doesn’t mean that I’m a bad person or that there’s anything wrong with me. Also some people ARE just mean spirited and it says more about them than it does about the people they’re being mean to/about.  [info] None [info] 1527474147

But, I started seeing someone when I had so much anxiety that I couldn't perform on exams (the LSAT, specifically) without having major panic attacks, and I simultaneously developed severe insomnia. I was diagnosed with anxiety as well as OCD in the form of perfectionism. I started taking zoloft and was prescribed klonopin (a take-as-needed) and it's helped quite a bit (though tbh only on week 6 of that, so take this w a grain of salt). So tl;dr: no, you're not making this up, and I would definitely recommend seeing someone and inquiring about SSRIs and maybe even a take-as-needed if you ever have panic attacks or insomnia. And feel free to reach out anytime if you need help or have questions &lt;3 we gotta stick together us high-functioning-high-anxiety-ers  [info] None [info] 1543779252

appa4494 [info] Getting anxious when weekends are almost over. But then I’m fine when they are. Hey all, first time posting, I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago, I declined any medication bc I’m in the National Guard. I wouldn’t say my anxiety is severe but it’s bad enough to where I cannot do any kind of public speaking.When my weekends are close to ending I can’t seem to do anything I enjoy, I constantly freak out that “I don’t have time for that”, “I can’t do that” I don’t really know how to explain it but it’s just a constant feeling of uncomfortableness and I feel bad. When I go back to work though I’m fine. Just curious if anyone else has this problem?It’s even worse when I have to go to drill, omg I have this constant feeling of dread like “goddammit, this and this is gonna happen” but when I get there I’m fine.

Ptolemy222 [info] Hi, I have felt this way (Although I was diagnosed with anxiety at 16). I have struggled with it for years. But from my perspective what’s happening here is that you have personal insecurities in yourself. You feel although if you were to start talking to someone you would be judged, ridiculed, labelled. THIS is a natural thing that some guys go through. (I have some evolutionary theories that back this up a bit).But this may come from different things. Like times where you feel like you shouldn’t step up. or you think that someone has an advantage over you and you are comparing yourself. Or what I personally went through was fear of talking to people. It’s really “The Ego” which you never want to threaten. Eckhart Tolle - The power of now, IS A GREAT BOOK FOR THIS. But I think overcoming things like this comes with that internal belief that who you are is valuable. What you believe is valuable. You can have confidence in almost any situation. You think what other people say is valuable, but interpret what people say to be truthful to yourself before accepting it as a fact. You need to think less that people are “Higher” or “Lower” than you, and start thinking that we’re all human on the same level, some people make really stupid mistakes, we get over it, and we’re all trying our best. This will come with time naturally because we grow into stronger people everyday if we move in that direction.Some stuff I did to get over my anxiety (Not necessarily what you have), was by taking weird challenges. Like Saying something stupid to see how someone will react. Start making conversations with strangers. Literally going out everyday through my anxiety and socially experimenting to figure out what are good things  and what are not good things to do. Socially experiment, have confidence in yourself.I’m not sure if this helped. But I am trying.  [info] None [info] 1510969498
Tophat_Benny [info] Did I have a panic attack? (ER story) I want to preface this that I have been diagnosed with anxiety but its "mostly" under control as I currently do not take usual anti anxiety meds, just a few for sleeping, trazadone, hydroxizine, CBD oil, though the one that feels does the most is CBD.  I also have been having breathing problems for the last year.  So far it's been mostly allergy related, I'm on a 1 a day control inhaler.  Even though later on my actual Asthma test came up negative, I still take the control because it does seem to help, cold air, dust, are triggers.  So when I woke up today with shortness of breath, dizzy, felt like passing out, I thought it was lung related.  My inhalers did nothing, I felt awful, so I had my wife drive me to the ER.  Blood tests came back normal.  Had a chest CT scan which showed no abnormalities.  My blood is circulating oxygen fine, my lungs are not wheezy.  So they basically sent me home and said to follow up with my primary.  I'm still tired, and little nauseous.  But I'm doing slightly better later in the day.  Is this all in my head?  I've had smaller attacks before but they felt way different, and once I realised I was anxious it went away. They were never debilitating as it was today. [info] None [info] 1579724428

Odysseus32 [info] Yes you absolutely would be screwed.I was talking to my boss the other day and he was telling me about the guy before me who would always have anxiety attacks.  and he said every couple of days they would flare up and he would need to go sit in his car for 20-30 minutes to calm down.  That made him a bad worker.I have been diagnosed with anxiety.  I have taken anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medicine and can't quite find the right one because the meds make my already terrible anxiety so bad before it starts working that I can't handle it.  I told them that anxiety was very real and that every once in a while I while have an attack during the day (most of mine are at night or when I'm sleeping) and they were like "oh he didnt really have anxiety he just wanted to not work" and I thought "how in the world could you possibly know that?"  If I have an attack it won't be apparent because I'm doing everything I can to control it until I can get somewhere private.US employers care about you showing up, and you working hard.  they don't care about anything else, unless you're with a local company with a very empathetic owner.

FlacOrGtfo [info] I switched from Vyvanse (40mg) to Evekeo (10mg x 2), since Vyvanse gave me side effects like some increased heartrate and anxiety, as well as agitating crashes and a little acid reflux.For me, Evekeo, which is instant release 50/50 d-amph/l-amph, kicks in after about 45 minutes, (gives me like 15 minutes of euphoria) and has about 1.5 or 2 hours of focus. Then I have a crash a few hours later and causes me to be perhaps worse than before. I actually have worse anxiety, longer periods of increased heartrate, and worse acid reflux. But the effects are going to vary a lot from person to person. Like, for me, I'm diagnosed with anxiety. At first, the crash effects made me feel sick like a cold or something and then settled down after a couple weeks.It is a temporary anti-depressant, I suppose. And it is energizing and helps me focus for a bit. But ultimately I want to find something else since I find the limited benefits and excessive side effects to be annoying... isn't Evekeo just a revival of benzedrine? [info] None [info] 1446471898

But I've been diagnosed with anxiety by two doctors (just my regular primary care doctors) when I went in for unrelated issues and put on medication for anxiety.Also my boyfriend seems to think my anxiety isn't that bad for me to be on medication for it. But also I feel the most relaxed when I'm with him and he's never really seen me in the situations I get anxious in. But does make me second guess myself, my diagnoses, wonder if the doctors are just pushing medications. [info] None [info] 1556174116
dancingfruit [info] PCOS requires 3 things according to the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis:1. A/Oligomenorrhea - Minsan lang o walang regla (2 years ako nawalan)2. Hyperandrogenism - Mga symptomas na nagmumukhang 'lalaki' o pagninipis or pagkakalbo ng buhok sa ulo pero nag kaka bigote at pag kapal ng buhok sa mga bahagi ng katawan na di dapat sa babae - chest, belly, back, legs3. Confirmation sa ultrasound (Transv or anal, as previously discussed).What's included in PCOS is insulin resistance. Your body produces more insulin than normal as a result of the increase in testosterone. The consequence is rapid weight gain. I was able to control my PCOS from 180lb to 106lb pero I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder this year. Bumalik lahat ng symptoms ko. Ang laki uli ng tinaba ko ng 3 months (30+ pounds).If kukuha ka ng Ultrasound, dapat OB yung taga gawa hindi yung random radiologist. May training kasi na OB-Sonologist.

killercherry99 [info] CBD and me. A tale of anxiety. About me- I'm 34, married, 4 kids, 2 dogs, 2 cats. In 2011 I was diagnosed with anxiety, it was manageable then but slowly got worse until it took over my life. 2015 and 2016 were my worst years. I was turning into a terrible mother because I was afraid to go outside. I would finally go outside and drive to the grocery store only to cry in the parking lot and give up and go back home. If I did go in, more than once I'd have a panic attack and just leave the cart in the aisle and go home. I would sit in my house all day long convinced I was dying, it was always a heart attack and I was losing control of my panic attacks over it. I was too scared to even go to the Dr because I was sure they'd tell me I was dying. I was keeping my life together to outsiders, but I was a shell of a person. I declined every invitation and made it sound like I was doing something else so everyone always thought I was so busy. I had zero friends here on purpose- my husband is military so I only have friends and family back home and I could fake phone calls. In 2016 we bought a new home. To keep my kids in their previous schools meant a half hour drive on the freeway each way. I had to get my shit together. My sister told me about CBD and I did alot of research (mostly here!) before I took the plunge,  and I now literally have my life back. It's been about 7 months and the only regret is the years I lost suffering. I have friends, people like me and invite me places- I'm actually busy all the time and not scared to go anywhere! I will be my daughter's Girl Scout leader next year and I'm running for secretary of the school PTA.  Brands I like- Bluebird Classic 6x, I take this in the evening as it's more relaxing. Cbdistillery- I use this as needed if I feel anxiety coming mid regular dose. Just about 2 drops. And my newest I like is Receptra Elite. I take this every morning. My dosage is about 20mg both morning and night. I live in CA and while they have passed laws to legalize marijuana, there are no stores as of yet but I am looking forward to trying THC when I can. My town has a few bids to bring in grow operations and I would love nothing more than to find work there as I feel like I'm a huge testimony to how it can help mental health.

AlaeniaFeild [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks about 15 years ago. I never felt right with the diagnosis. It wasn't until about 2 years ago that I heard of POTS and went to my doctor asking for testing. She did a poor man's tilt table test and sent me to the cardiologist. Saw a cardiologist, did a 14 day Zio patch monitor, turned out to be SVT (not severe) and POTS (diagnosed after neurologist visit). I don't take meds for the SVT though and no ablation unless something changes. My attacks are only every other day or so and don't last for more than a few minutes (usually less.) So it could also just be something that is monitored. This is only anecdotal of course and I don't know if obesity affects treatment in any way, but I just want to point out that even if it is SVT, sometimes it's just monitored rather than treated with anything. OP, good luck. It can be very scary when this happens. I really do suggest seeing a doctor about this and don't accept a panic attack diagnosis without investigation if it doesn't sit right with you. I know that we shouldn't be diagnosing ourselves, but this is one area where I feel women (especially young women like you) need to push to be heard.  [info] This user has not yet been verified.

viptenchou [info] Anxiety about permanent choices and getting fixed. In replying to another post, I finally realized something. I'm terrified of permanent choices, thus making me feel uncomfortable to get fixed despite it being what I really want to do. In fact, part of why I dont want kids is because it's a permanent choice that can't be undone so I know I'll never do it.I was quite sure about getting fixed, though. I was a little nervous at the thought of something I couldn't change, but when I thought about it logically it just made sense. I've never wanted kids, ever. I already declared at 14 vocally that I didn't. I feel awkward around kids and have a whole list of reasons why I don't want them. I'm passionate about my CF choice. I tell every man I've ever been involved with since after my first bf who argued about the subject with me that I WILL NOT have kids and I would tell them pretty much right away. I'm tokophobic as well and I have so much anxiety and many other illnesses that I wouldn't want to pass on. I also can't stand too much noise or being in places that have too much "energy". I like staying home, relaxing. I like my space. I've even discussed with my current bf that we need a room to share but also we need our own rooms so we have our own space when we live together. I am 99.9999999% positive I will never change my mind. So of course, I reasoned that even if it made me a bit nervous to do something permanent... It's the best choice for me. But when I told my mom, even though she 100% supports my decision, she didn't think it was a good idea because if I did change my mind, she would be heartbroken for me and that there are a lot of long term BC options I could use instead. Not getting my mom's support really shook me. She always supports me with everything in life; she's been my biggest support for everything. Even when I told her randomly one day that I wanted to go to school across the world in Japan. So having her say she didn't think it was a good idea totally broke me here and now I feel really worried about the idea of getting fixed.I still really want to. I still look it up and think to myself that I will. But I worry that I won't be able to go through with it, not even because of doctors but because of my fear of permanent things. Does anyone else have this issue? :/ Has anyone else had it and gotten fixed anyway? How did that go for you? How did you get over that fear? (btw, I am diagnosed with anxiety and have been since childhood). Any ideas on how to get over the fear? Clearly, I already know it's the logical choice... I'm just still anxious. :/ [info] 24/F/I want to travel the world, not the baby section of walmart [info] 1482568442

ajconway [info] Doctor won't talk to me about dosing cannabis for PTSD. Looking for advice. I was diagnosed with anxiety and PTSD after an extreme traumatic event last November. I see a wonderful psychiatrist but I needed medication to be able to function at work without collapsing into tears or have a single night's sleep without waking up screaming. My PCP has cycled me through a variety of anxiety prescriptions, and they have zero effect on me. 5 months of trying and I can't see any method of returning to my happy, creative, functional self. I've only kept the lorazapam for the extreme panic attacks, but it reduces me to a sleepy potato, so I can't take it at work if I plan to do anything other than take a nap at my desk.After the third failed medication, I asked my PCP about medical cannabis and other drugs and they absolutely refuse to hear anything about it. Weed is legal here in Boston but I'm not a recreational user. I've probably smoked less times than I have fingers on one hand. But I know there is **some dosage**, and **some frequency of use** that could benefit me enough to survive through the day. Eating is also a massive part of my PTSD too; I've lost 20lb in the past two months. I've never had an eating disorder before but because the trauma relates to starvation, I've frequently gone days without eating, or throwing up after a meal simply out of the stress and guilt. I'm sure I'm on the right path when I ask my doctor if I would be suitable for cannabis for all these reasons. I know I can just go purchase it myself, but I wanted to know how/when/how much I should be taking in order to remain productive at work, sleep at night, and regain my apatite. My PCP wouldn't give me any information, so I guess I'm turning to the internet.General stats that can help: I'm 130lb (down from 160lb before this happened), work 9-5, don't drink alcohol, have very little experience in drugs. I don't even know where to start in terms of smoking or edibles, and what mg could at least help me begin to regain myself. Any help is appreciated. [info] None [info] 1585272573

It works. When you start JUST DOING IT, whatever it is that’s making you anxious, and seeing that there is almost never a repercussion, you get over it. Especially with social anxiety, and especially in the adult world, shit just really really doesn’t matter as much as you tell yourself it does. Majority of people that you could have a potentially awkward situation with, you never fucking have to see again if you don’t want to. Life’s just too short to hold back.

Because of that, I didn't graduate high school nor college. I spiralled and honestly I didn't know how to go on. But, my fear of basically everything but my own shadow has kept me from ending things myself. (Good thing too, because when things are calm, I don't want to die). The past two years I've done some intensive therapy and it has helped me push on a little bit. Because of this therapy, I thought I had the strength to get my teeth fixed. So at the beginning of this year, I started the process and saw a dental surgeon. The prognosis is that I'll get dentures and they'll remove my teeth while they put me asleep. The process started in February and I only recently got to know the date for the actual surgery. I've just been in a state of constantly waiting. I spend my days playing video games, trying to tune out the dread and the anxiety, but it's getting harder and harder to do. My family and friends are very caring and they support me. They try to give me pep talks but I'm so afraid I'll let them (and myself) down. I'm afraid I won't be able to go through with the surgery and in all honesty I believe I might not even survive that day because of the stress and anxiety. I can very logically tell me that's unlikely.. but the feelings and thoughts remain. I don't know anymore how to handle this. The surgery is little less than two weeks away and I don't know how I'll be able to last through the rest of the days, waiting. I feel utterly alone, even though I KNOW I have the support of my friends and family. [info] None [info] 1566937966
EchoVixen [info] My partner and I have a similar chemistry. I worry a lot about the big things and the little things. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago. My partner, on the other hand, is the most relaxed person I know. Everything washes over him, nothing phases him. I love him dearly and I know he loves me, but I still worry that my anxiety is grating on him and I sometimes wish he would reassure me the way you do in your post. That being said, he's never been one for speeches or romantic gestures and just as he accepts me, I accept him. He's affectionate in his own way. You seem like a genuinely great person, I hope you and your partner have an amazing future together. [info] None [info] 1540652289
WestCoastKate [info] Anxiety over holding baby. Scared of dropping. I am almost 27 weeks with baby #2. My first is almost 8 years old, with such a big gap I jave forgotten a lot. About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety (which, looking back I am fairly certain was PPA) and have been fighting it this entire pregnancy. Currently I am dreading holding my baby. I have a few more months until she is here and I need to figure it out before then. My SIL just had a baby girl and I can't hold her without extreme anxiety/mild panic attacks. I feel like I am going to drop her (even though I have only held her while sitting). I am already on Celexa and it is working pretty well. Any other mom's with anxiety/fear of dropping baby have any tips? What worked for you? [info] None [info] 1529197378

melbyz1980 [info] Sound and Anxiety I’ve always been sensitive to sounds, I was diagnosed with anxiety at a young age. There are sounds that other people don’t notice that are distracting, and drown out other sounds. They drive me crazy. The fan on the stove hood is a regular source of frustration as an example.Shopping can be maddening and I fully understand that feeling of not being able to hear myself think.I’m wondering if anyone else gets anxiety from sounds, and if they have found any effective ways of coping or managing it?

vanilla_ice22 [info] I love my dog, but she gives me so much anxiety [Vent] Granted, I am diagnosed with anxiety so I get anxiety with everything. I got this dog to be an emotional support animal for my anxiety and so far I only feel worse. Every single bit of my life now is focused on how she feels, and making her feel better. I spend so much time trying to help her overcome her rough past and feel happy in my home. All the while I am so anxious and don’t know what to do with myself. I just feel so much anxiety building up over time I just want to escape. What human in their right mind wants to escape from their dog? It drives me crazy being with her alone in my apartment all day and all night, because she looks to me for guidance. If I don’t give her the right amount of attention, or I yell at her, she is sad and depressed the whole day. When I see her sad and depressed it makes me sad and depressed because I feel like I’m not doing enough or I’m a bad mommy. I just CANT do enough and still feel okay.Along with being anxious all the time I also feel like I’ve completely lost my identity. All I ever talk about is this dog, I don’t even know who I am anymore. Anytime I go out with my dog, I just start to realize how irrelevant I am compared to my dog. No one wants to talk to me anymore they want to talk to my dog. All the focus is on her and I suddenly feel like I am more overlooked than ever before. She is an angel and I do want her to be my pride and joy, but it has taken so much from me I want to cry. I don’t know what to do and everyone in my life has put so much pressure on me to never give this dog up, but no one acknowledges the fact that I am giving up on myself. Everyone just cares about the dog but I am still just as unwell if not more than I was before. [info] None [info] 1546752039
2deadhamsters [info] My brother is hateful So I've been diagnosed with anxiety  and have been to a therapist to treat my issues. I'm glad to say that I am getting better. My anxiety is very closely related to my family. I worry constantly about them and if they are ok or not. So I follow them alot and like to stay close/ in my comfort zone . My fucking brother on the other hand likes to make my anxiety worse when he is frustrated with me. Often he will walk off on purpose and push me away. When I become worried and follow him he mostly responds with " go and have a panic attack then" he also threatens to leave the house and go to a random place when we argue. He can never admit when he is wrong and constantly lies to everybody and  himself and blames me lets use a simple example if we are eating he will say I was greedy and ate more. He actually cannot compromise and has to have everything his way. If it's not he will walk away and scare me and also my family. (We are both 15). He's just absolutely hateful but my anxiety means I can not leave him otherwise i will become extremely anxious and have a panic attack. I want to make it clear that I am not a perfect person and I become to angry and aggressive because to be honest I'm absolutely sick of being terrified day and night that he's dead or missing Any time he is scolded he will disassociate and ignore. No emotional reaction no sign that he has changed or recognised where he has gone wrong nothing. It's also like every time I say something he will find a way to disagree with it if I want to go to a castle he will refuse but if I don't he will want to go. If I want to talk to him he refuses. If I don't he will follow me . He has this blunt and emotionless face and is incredibly stubborn. And he knows how to upset me and often insults me and my anxiety even though he has had anxiety an knows what it's like. I'm just done he's driven me absolutely crazy. [info] None [info] 1565899725
madmaxturbator [info] He had no clue how much a single pill would affect him, so to take two and then an ambien is intense.That’s a terrible way to prescribe meds.I have taken pills recreationally and also for medical issues / anxiety. In both circumstances it’s good to start with low dosage to understand your tolerance / threshold. That’s what a good doctor will do... When I was diagnosed with anxiety, my doctor told me to take .25mg klonopin. Then work your way up, if it’s not helping with the anxiety.Popping two Xanax and ambien for what was his first time trying those meds is really reckless. Dude is defending his doctor, but she sounds like a terrible doc frankly. Mixing strong meds like that in a fucking airplane (ie medical help is very limited) is insane. [info] None [info] 1527699410

ramsay_baggins [info] My fiance and I have been together just over five years.In that time he has stood by me as I became physically ill with fear of confronting my flatmates in halls at University, as I stressed and stressed and stressed with Uni work, as I developed anxiety doing my dissertation, as I had really bad worries about getting a job after graduating, as I was diagnosed with anxiety because of the job I got...Just before I graduated I got really sick. Had to go to the hospital at 3am after only developing symptoms about six hours beforehand. He was panicking more than I was, but he sorted transportation, held my hand the whole way through, and then looked after me when I was bedridden for a week, couldn't eat and could hardly move.He held my arm for support everywhere I went when I got labrynthitis and couldn't walk unaided because I had lost all sense of balance.He came literally running to comfort me when I found out my stepsister had been involved in a serious and potentially life-threatening accident.He still talks me down when I had panic attacks and random freakouts.He reads me to sleep every night because he knows it helps me calm down. He even puts up with me when I interrupt him with questions or random observations about the story or character.He always encourages me in pretty much everything I do.He's wonderful.

Dr3wcifer [info] *Update* We are unable to establish your eligibility to hold an airman medical certificate at this time... [My Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/c0aoa4/we_are_unable_to_establish_your_eligibility_to/)&amp;nbsp;Since the initial letter I received from the FAA specified that my initial medical was not suspended pending review, I decided to go the least intensive route first to see what FAA would request as followup while continuing to fly. I had my primary care doc draft a short letter basically saying I was fine. While I was overseas on a vacation, FAA finally responded to that certified letter stating that after review, they have found that I AM eligible for my current third-class medical and I may now continue to use it as if nothing had happened. No special issuance, no followup request for records or imaging.&amp;nbsp;So basically, here's all I did - I went to my VA primary care doc, since the VA is the only place with an records of my anxiety diagnosis, and the only place I've ever received followup care for my broken back. I had them write a short letter that specifically addressed and answered the exact questions presented in the initial FAA letter. The opening paragraph of his letter stated that he was my primary care doc, and that he had evaluated me previously in the year (February) for a routine evaluation. Second paragraph precisely refuted any inhibitions due to back pain, third paragraph precisely refuted any inhibitions due to anxiety and confirmed I had never been prescribed for the condition. The doc used the same language in his response that the FAA used in their request, and he also specifically stated that my most recent evaluation for anxiety found that the symptoms were "mild or transient." I'm not entirely sure if the VA will be dropping my disability rating for anxiety, and it wouldn't bother me if they did - I made it clear that I didn't think it was an issue during my last VA evaluation, but the doc essentially said "better safe than sorry" and kept the rating.&amp;nbsp;If anyone is in a similar situation to this, especially since the VA has been handing out mental health diagnoses like candy for the last decade, I can post up the entire initial request letter from FAA, my doc's response letter, and the follow-up from FAA.&amp;nbsp;To be clear, I was diagnosed with anxiety a decade ago but never treated/prescribed for it, and it's never really been an issue. I have also never been hindered by my broken back, other than being a bit shorter and fatiguing a bit faster when I go backpacking. Overall, probably not a common situation, but if anyone can learn from it, awesome. [info] PPL SEL [info] 1565706239

savorycinnamon [info] At what point should I admit defeat and quit my high pressure job? I got a great first job after getting my license, immediately becoming a director at a small healthcare facility. This was July 2019, and I've been trying to settle in to my new position ever since. I've had a few good weeks here and there, but I'm an anxious person, and I have lost a lot of sleep over small mistakes and demanding projects. We also changed CEO's, and the new one has made extreme changes I don't agree with and continues to do so without considering current staff. I was awake and panicking at 2 am yesterday and I've been awake since 1:45 am today because I'm stressing about a conversation with my boss from 2 days ago and a big event today. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and recently started with a new therapist. I've told her about my job, but we haven't gotten too far yet and I only see her every 2 weeks.I guess I'm just struggling to know how much I should push myself. It's been a long time coming, and I'm finally happy with where I am in my career. I have over $100,000 in student loans and a strong desire to buy a house, so I'm fairly pleased with my income and know I will not make as much elsewhere right now. But the stress is really overwhelming, partially due to my job and exacerbated by my anxiety.I'm fairly young and early in my career, and I could really use some perspective... and a vacation.

oldpaintunderthenew [info] Oh YES. Perhaps not depressed until hitting puberty (at 9-10, thanks ovaries) but I was anxious literally since birth and I just thought this was how everyone is..? I was diagnosed with anxiety at 16 and laughed at it, me? Anxious? Nooo I am outwardly very calm and don't burden people with my worries so what is the psychiatrist on about? I looked up anxiety symptoms after that and *bam* - it was an embarrassingly high age for me to realize that everyone isn't horrified of everything all the time and doing anything isn't supposed to feel monumentally scary and other people won't obsess about the same little thing for hours a day, every day, for years.

loserkidtbh [info] Hard disagree. I've been a picky eater since I can remember. It's been linked to my anxiety disorder about trying new foods, texture issues, etc. I will try new food at home, but it takes a bit of working up to it. Also I can't explain to you the anxiety picky eaters feel when they go out to eat with family and friends. I've had to settle for just a water before because I was 2 seconds away from a panic attack if I got food. I know, all this sounds completely ridiculous to you and it sounds it to me too. But, I don't think you'll fully understand a lot of us don't want to be picky eaters. A majority of us aren't doing it to be "cute" or whatever. Anxiety just gets in the way of it. I've dealt with anxiety disorder since a little kid and I was diagnosed with anxiety around age 6? 7? That's also when I became a picky eater. Just give us a break, dude. We aren't harming you at all by being a picky eater. Like I said, a lot of us don't want to be one. We just are trying to push through it like a lot of the other stuff we have to push through.

AncientPotential [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was a kid. I dont think my mom ever quite understood that I wasnt faking when I said I COULDNT go to school, and I'm not sure I ever explained to her what I was feeling. She even went as far as to tell me I should take a pregnancy test (at 13) when I would wake up every weekday morning dry heaving for an hour or 2. Years later, she tells me my step-father keeps thinking he is having a stroke or some other neurological issue (they had CAT scans done and everything) cause his face and hands keep going numb, and his heart will just start beating out of his chest. I told her to ask their doctor about anxiety and LO AND BEHOLD, thats exactly what he had. My mom felt really bad for all those mornings she yelled at me and made me go to class.Until you think your are legitimately dying because your body goes numb and you might ACTUALLY shit your pants, ya aint had the anxious.

alex-smith321 [info] getting accepted to colleges really stressing me out sooo basically im getting my results back from schools one by one. I applied to like 16 different schools (I know, its a lot but my grades don't reflect well on me so I needed all the opportunities possible) long story short I've gotten accepted to 7/16 schools so far without being deferred or rejected. a part of me is really happy and excited because I got into the majority of my reach schools already but the other side of me is confused and it's consuming me. I find myself with 7 tabs open on my laptop all at once researching each of the school's acceptance rates, average sat scores, average GPA, etc. I feel like I don't deserve a spot at these schools bc my grades all fall in the 25th percentile and its so hard to wrap my mind around the fact that they really chose me. I should be ecstatic but my anxiety and need to know the reason behind my acceptance is consuming my happiness. how should I deal with this??I've been diagnosed with anxiety.

randomuserIam [info] I always had troubles orgasming during sex unless I had toys or put a lot of attention to me, with my previous (vanilla) partner. I never had issues alone, though. But I was diagnosed with anxiety and put on medication, one of which is ssri and interferes with orgasm. I have a decent libido (or so I found out) and I have a lot of pleasure, but I can't for the life of me climax. My Dom fully understands, he still tries but after it's been hours of play it gets exhausting. I still manage to cum alone, with a lot of effort though, but much faster. So I think there's a part of me that's also stopping me because of the pressure to cum. I do know, however, that I can be forced to orgasm... Provided certain criteria is met. So, my next investment will actually be a wand, instead of what I currently own that is worse than a bullet...  [info] None [info] 1553533076

EnclaveLeo [info] Just graduated with a BA in Comp Sci and wanted to add to the already great advice here - sophomore year in Comp Sci is definitely rough so don't get down on yourself. A 4.0 your first semester is amazing, and I understand how it feels to have a "slip" but it's okay to slip. Especially after transferring in, Clemson kicked my ass my first semester I transferred in. Don't feel bad about having to withdraw from a class and trying again next semester - most Comp Sci students I know took an extra semester to graduate (like me). I was diagnosed with anxiety my junior year and had to find ways to make my coursework manageable. I definitely know what you mean about needing a routine schedule and reminders, I'm the same way. Definitely get your professors to work with your accommodations.I really hope you feel better and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat!

Ngonzalez_01 [info] Please pray for me to stop being so scared of suffering for the Gospel. “Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels” (Mark 8:38).“Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name” (1 Peter 4:16).God has put so many people in my life that I believe He has called me to preach the Gospel to. After all, if not me, then who? The problem is that whenever an opportunity rises to mention Jesus, I get scared out of my mind. My brain goes 100mph and my stomach feels like it's about to explode. I was diagnosed with anxiety as a kid, and by the grace of God I've been able to get better at controlling it and talking to people. But when the Holy Spirit convicts me to tell my friends the Gospel, I lose all sense of calmness. Some of you may remember my post about me being the only believer in my family. Last time I tried to preach the Bible openly, they took away my Bible and even compared my religion to an addiction. Thankfully they've "calmed down" a little and started letting me read and go to church, but since then, the thought of preaching has scared the living daylights out of me. In the parable of the 4 seeds, Jesus mentioned one seed that falls on thorns only to be choked out. Often I worry that I'm the "thorn seed" rather than the "good soil seed". So I ask, please pray that God will make me strong enough to preach the Gospel once more. TL;DR: I want to preach the Gospel to my friends, but I'm too scared. Please pray that God will make me strong enough to overcome this fear. [info] None [info] 1564943821

Jacobmarksman275 [info] Please tell me it gets better: Existential Crisis OCD/Derealization Hey guys. I am 24 years old, have an amazing 7 month old daughter and a beautiful fiancé. I was diagnosed with anxiety, panic disorder, and OCD when I was 9. I have had various themes over the years but for the past 6 months I had a clean slate! I was working so much and living a great life! I even was able to drink almost every night without getting anxiety the next day (Not binge drinking and the fact I was ABLE to drink almost every night was a huge accomplishment). Then quarantine happened. It was alright, then my OCD got mild, and now it’s full blown. My theme now is the question: “Where did we come from? What is the point of life?” Even if you’re an atheist please understand (almost in tears) Christianity has been a huge part of my life and my cornerstone when all these questions happened. Also I am having derealization where I feel like I am losing control and I am about to go insane. Has anyone who has gone through this theme help me?

zigzagwag [info] Chest pains that go away when I'm occupied with other things So I've been diagnosed with anxiety. Something I probably should've sought treatment for years ago. For about a decade I would get these chest pains in the middle of the night, take some aspirin (because that stops heart attacks, right?) text my boyfriend that I loved him (because those should be my last words to him) and watch a movie to go back to sleep.For the last 2 months, work has been unusually stressful on top of me having to take flights (&amp; what would be a more inconvenient place to have a heart attack?).  About a week ago I was dismissed from my job even though I have a job lined up to start in another week. With that being said I've been home with nothing to occupy myself with but these chest pains.

Also, he cannot seem to have a single conversation where he doesn't bring up his own emotions and when I ask him to focus on my feelings solely for a  single conversation he gets upset.

WookieRubbersmith [info] Any experience with Wellbutrin? Hi, friends!I'm in my late 20s, and have not been medicated until this point (parents "don't believe in ADHD" and are against pharmaceutical intervention, so it's taken a while to work through that).My coping mechanisms aren't enough anymore, so I decided to talk to my therapist about meds. I've been diagnosed with anxiety on top of the ADHD, so he's pretty sure stimulants will be a bad fit for me. He's recommended Wellbutrin, which is an antidepressant that's apparently cross prescribed for ADHD.Anyone have any experience with Wellbutrin for ADHD? Anyone taken both stimulants and Wellbutrin before who can compare how they work (for you, not chemically as a drug)? Anyone with anxiety as well who has had a good experience with stimulants or any particular non-stimulant treatment?I'm a little freaked out about the idea of taking an antidepressant when I'm not depressed, but that might just be my "pharmaceuticals are baad, mkay?" baggage cropping up.

slimgunner [info] I normally sleep on my side. When I was young I did fall and hit my head but that was when I was 10. I noticed this sensation when I was 18. Not sure if it could be related but I have always been thinking that they have. I couldn’t really say what brings it on because it is pretty much constantly there, just depends how much I notice it. The pain is on top of my head and is always in the same spot. But no sensation in my neck. I do sometimes get tingling and numbness feelings in my body and arm. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I have seen psychologist previously so maybe some could be anxiety related. But if it was a brain tumour or ms, wouldn’t my symptoms be bit more severe considering I have had this for 4 years?  [info] None [info] 1553287904
undercover_gk [info] Seeking insight about my own ability to feel when death is near someone I know. As a child I was diagnosed with anxiety. As in I was medicated at 15 for it. I eventually learned that I have 2 very different types of anxiety. One is actual anxiety, which is a pretty mild form of gad. The other is what in the beginning seemed like random moments of feeling like the world would end. Well more of a creeped out impending doom sense. Like someone walked over your own grave, or a demon passed right beside you. I now work in end of life as in a nursing home and have for almost 10 years. I've had plenty of time to test this other form of anxiety. It only happens a few hours before someone I know dies. I rarely know who it will be, how, exactly when or any details. I mean sometimes I do know all the details. It's just rare and has to be someone I'm close to. Until, this past week this feeling has never lasted more than an hour or so. However, for the past 8 days I have been fighting this feeling constantly. I can barely sleep for it, and nothing is helping. My theory is that I'm about to lose someone really important to me, or possibly several people. If anyone has any sort of insight into this sort of thing I would be greatly appreciative. I know my grandmother has the same abilities, she just won't discuss it with me as she's very religious and doesn't like it. It's a crazy case of native American turned pentecostal.

Mekchrious [info] A [rant] because not sleeping sucks I was diagnosed with anxiety about a month ago after close to a year of symptoms (specifically GAD).  The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them.  And I have; a healthy lifestyle is something I treasure, and probably keeps much of the feeling at bay, along with a dose of daily meditation.But this last week has really sucked.  I'm a person with very high situational awareness; I sit by fire exits for example.  I always have; being a perfectionist and a lover of the worst-case-scenario, I prepare for it.  But this manifests as bad paranoia when my anxiety hits.  It's not unusual for me not to sleep well; but this past week has been a string of four and five hour nights.  Naps and working out have kept me going, but it's been rough!So today  I ran even further than I usually do and hopefully exhausted myself enough that I will sleep better.I know I am probably a newbie at this compared to many of you and haven't been suffering as long, but I'm truly starting to see what many sufferers of anxiety go through, and it is no me gusta!

Thadwater [info] I'm feeling not the greatest. I have a loving wife who knows I am depressed, but I truly don't feel like talking about it at the moment, so I am just going to post here. It may help. I have everything I could ever need, yet feel sad, empty and dull. House, wife, pets, a great job, but I still feel like crap. This last week has sucked. I hope it gets better soon. I take antidepressants under the guise that they help with migraines and anxiety. I would go back and get officially diagnosed but that would just give me another 5 years of being denied extra life insurance. As I try to be a responsible adult, I try to get enough to cover my expenses in case of an accident or something. I've been denied 4 times to have an increase above the minimum my company allows. I think I will be eligible this year. You have to be 5 yrs removed from any new diagnosis and it was 5 years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety. (What a backwards system...)So I'm a bit stuck in that department. Like I wrote above, just hoping this gets better soon. I am tired of being tired. Haha.  [info] None [info] 1521303014
Snapley [info] Can I ask a question about your panic attacks? I used to experience both panic attacks and anxiety attacks (I think they are different but they could be the same) Please ignore the rest of the comment if you don’t want to answer or you think it’s too sensitive a question.It felt like two different things to me, and I am diagnosed with anxiety by a professional, but it hasn’t been a big issue for a while. One type of attack felt like worries were in my head and I would get all the emotional and physical symptoms.But the other type of attack didn’t seem to be triggered by any anxious thought, it would come out of nowhere and literally be the scariest thing. It’s been ages since I had one but from what I remember it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and my body would shake and I would get the worst tingling in my stomach. This one would come on randomly, like when riding a bike with a friend or walking home.Which one sounds more like a panic attack to you?  [info] None [info] 1534488980
uninventedword [info] How do I tell my crush I like him, and am I a stalker? Around four years ago, a new face appeared at the local gym, and I fell in love with it. He was the most beautiful boy my teenage heart had ever seen. He quickly became a regular at the gym, and was part of the reason I wanted to keep going, if only for the fact that the mere sight of him and his sunny personality brightened my day. However, I never spoke to him. Not once. I regretted it every time. Last fall, he left for college, which I knew because I'd overheard him talking about it to someone else there.    Only the year before that did I hear he was the same age as me. I'd thought he might be older. But, that didn't matter. Everything I knew about him, I knew from other's conversations with him, for my cowardice stopped every impulse to even say hello. I treasured every found morsel. He came back for holidays, and lastly for the coronavirus lock down. The last day the gym was open, for the first time, I heard someone say his name. Just his first name. At first, the name didn't seem fitting. It was too majestic, too rich, too mature sounding. Like the names of centuries long past. When I went home that day, I did something that could only leave a sour taste in my mouth. I searched his first name on Facebook, coupled with the name of the town where we live. The town isn't too big. I found his profile quickly, out of only 13-15 results. His full name was on his profile. I searched it on google. To my shock, I found that he has a YouTube channel. Not a beginner one, at that. I also found his Instagram. I didn't watch any of his videos. I couldn't. It was too far. Knowing details of someone's life, posted online, where those of the home town are likely not meant to... to... I don't know. This is where I become confused. The reason I did all this was to find a way to message him, if I couldn't see him  anymore. I desperately want to know him, but I don't want it to be from afar. If only he knows how I feel, that would be enough. But, there is no conceivable way I can think of doing it without fear of sounding like a creepy, obsessed, crazy woman. Am I just that? Creepy? Obsessed? Crazy? I have all the signs of an internet stalker. Well, just enough of them to be worrying. But, am I? Is this behavior acceptable, or not, in this confusing era of life through a lens?Extra Facts: I've been diagnosed with anxiety, and social anxiety. I've also lived a life as if in quarantine, because I've been home-schooled, and have allergies that may cause my death. Also, everyone says I'm beautiful, but I worry he will not think so, or perhaps everyone is just being nice. In conclusion: Help. [info] None [info] 1587805580

julcarls [info] I'm so so sorry you went through that. I can relate slightly, though my illness truly is "in my head." I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder 2 years ago. Basically my body goes into fight or flight mode for no reason at all or if I get too excited watching a movie or something normal. It's very, very irritating and it caused me to be suicidal. Six months after my diagnosis, my husband and I had a mild argument and I started to panic hard. He proceeded to tell me how "convenient" it was that I was having a massive panic attack following an argument and that I was probably faking for his affections. That hurt so badly. I will never forget it. He has since apologized and always comforts me when I have attacks. I understand his point of view because he literally can't see my heart rate ascend 100 more bpm or my vision going haywire or my lungs taking in less air. He can't see that I feel like I'm having a heart attack. He knows it's not convenient in the least for me. I was able to forgive him because of his continued support. [info] None [info] 1568984538
mattbernss [info] Yes, I've also been going through this for the past 9 months. Always nauseous in the mornings, I don't eat breakfast, maybe only something that goes down very easily like watermelon. Missed a lot of school, got blood tests, an MRI and endoscopy, and nothing. Noticed that the only times that I got nauseous was at school and around SO. I was diagnosed with anxiety 2 and a half weeks ago, and I've been taking 50mgs of Zoloft prescribed by my psychologist.It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one having this.

LameSaucey [info] My third, actually! The first two I had what I would call normal anxiety, now it’s just...awful. And has started pouring into every other aspect of my life. I can’t sleep at night because I’m worried my 7 month old will stop breathing, or that someone will break into the house, or that the doors aren’t locked.  I spend way too much time daily worrying about my husband while he’s at work (he’s a tattoo artist, there’s really not much to worry about, but I’m just always worried) Every time my two year old has a tantrum, I’m worried the neighbors are going to call the police (he’s like...way loud haha) It just sucks, I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teenager, but apparently it has been a part of me for longer than that, but it wasn’t until I had my youngest that it truly and severely started impacting my day-to-day life, and I just want to feel normal again. Starting EMDR therapy on Tuesday, and I’m so so hopeful that this will help! [info] None [info] 1562385161

whostolethesampo [info] Fellow anxious person, and I get this too! At times before I was diagnosed with anxiety I legitimately thought I had throat cancer or a plethora of other horrible diseases. Now, years later, I’m finally able to recognize the feeling of “something stuck in my throat” as a symptom of my anxiety, and nothing else. Once I stop focusing on it, it goes away. It took me almost 4 years to be able to take control of this symptom, but I know how real it can seem. Last year DH and I were traveling in Europe and I was so convinced that I had throat cancer that I almost made us cut our trip short so that I could go home and see a doctor 🙄  [info] None [info] 1544007486
PoppaDR3W [info] It is scary. I definitely had/have a bit of it. For awhile, before I was diagnosed with anxiety, I didn't know what was going on. So every pain was a heart attack or a stroke or cancer. It was weird, because other people's stories made me anxious and get those feelings.Like someone I know had a benign brain tumor. I never had headaches, but after I was told that I had them within days. I had intense head pressure. :/  The easiest way to get over it, in my opinion, is to see a doctor and get a checkup. Being reaffirmed by a professional definitely helps. Take care of yourself - exercise and diet. :) [info] None [info] 1420838757
lostineverythin [info] I literally came on here just now to make a similar post, you are not alone.I've never written the MCAT yet, but thought I could self study and work full time this summer and be ready for August 20th. Boy was I wrong. I felt burnt out and tired by July. I also have immense pressure from my parents, so I can relate to the circumstances. It sucks, but I think I have accepted that I probably won't be able to apply this year. It also didn't help that I was diagnosed with anxiety halfway through the summer and my doctor and I are still trying to figure out my doses. I sometimes just want to lay in bed all day and do nothing, I don't want to go out, or see people or have responsibilities. It all fucking sucks.But this is not the end for you or me. Many people apply in their 30's even. We will have long (hopefully) and healthy lives, and if we really want it, we will get there at some point. Focus on you and do what you need to do. And don't put too much pressure on yourself, it's not healthy, we are not perfect.Just want to tell you that you aren't alone and that everything will work out in the end.edit: I will probably have to take a gap year too, because I am going into fourth year.

brearose [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety 14 years ago and with ADHD last week. I was put on citalopram last friday. I've had no problems so far, but it also hasn't helped yet (it takes a couple weeks to start working). My doctor said that ADHD medications can actually make anxiety worse, so it's common to take meds for ADHD and anxiety. I'm not on ADHD medication yet, because my doctor wants me to wait until the citalopram starts working first, but I will be taking citalopram and an ADHD med, so it is safe.

my-dinner-with-andre [info] People keep staring at me... How to manage? I'm diagnosed with anxiety and ocd. Unfortunately I'm really good looking and I care about my appearance (not trying to brag) which is a really bad combo. Everywhere I go I get stares and looks from pretty much everyone. I'm also very aware of my surroundings so it's a triple threat... I feel like I cant do anything in private, the only thing that I found helps is staring at the ground when I'm walking. Also when I'm anxious I try to hide it which I think comes off looking as arrogant or cocky when in reality I'm not at all. What can I do ? [info] None [info] 1575064382
mar736 [info] I don’t think it does, honestly. I am currently 28 weeks pregnant. I have worried since the day I find out. Before every ultrasound, every appointment. I kept telling myself that I wouldn’t be anxious anymore after x milestone (like reaching 12 weeks, or the anatomy scan, etc). However, I will say the anxiety has at least lessened. Now that I can feel my baby move a lot, I am at least reassured that he’s okay. Whereas before, there was just no way to know until my next appointment. I was diagnosed with anxiety before pregnancy, so definitely something that I was expecting to have to deal with. I think some of it is that and the other part is the expected being a worried mom. Therapy helps. What helped me a lot and still does is reminding myself that right now, at this moment in time, there is no reason to believe that my baby/pregnancy is not healthy. More likely than not it’ll stay that way. ALSO. Stay off of google. Google made me so much anxious than I already was. [info] None [info] 1569361583

keshi [info] Sounds similar to me, I had bad reflux for months then it went away and soon after I developed chest pains. After several visits to A&amp;E worrying about a heart attack (so many blood tests, x-rays, ECGs, etc.) I was diagnosed with anxiety and given pills.I wasn't doubting my anxiety, but felt that it was the chest pains causing it, not the other way around!Unhappy with the diagnosis I went back to see another GP. She pressed into each of my ribs and sternum and holy shit did it hurt on the top rips (but not at all on some of the others). She offered a working hypothesis of Costochondritis and it seemed to fit my condition.I felt much better after that visit and my anxiety went way down as I could tell myself it was just some rib pain. After having it for about 8 months I have more or less gotten used to it.I too feel it worst when I am hungry/tired/dehydrated. Night times are the worse, I generally use some anti-inflammatory gel on my chest if it's a rough night.I went back to see my GP this morning as a check up and she has referred me to a reoccurring muscular condition clinic for a second opinion and to give me some advice on stretches/how to deal with it etc.I too have wondered if the reflux is related to the Costochondritis and I really should clean up my diet via food elimination to check to dietary inflammatory responses.Good luck!

Kehndy12 [info] I've rolled only a few times and I've had edibles only a few times, mostly at music festivals. So I'm not an extremely experienced user, but I've read this subreddit a ton and I've done quite a bit of reading about MDMA.With that said, I don't think that you should think rolling will be like smoking weed. I'm diagnosed with anxiety, and edibles make me REALLY anxious and make my mind race. It seems I have to combine edibles with alcohol to get rid of the anxiety. (Note: Do not mix heavy drinking with MDMA or you risk blacking out.)Rolling, however, is completely different for me. Rolling puts users in a positive mindset. It makes people euphoric and happy. Rolling has inbuilt happiness that I do not find in edibles. There is not much anxiety except for the come up, and if you take a small dose, the come up will be minor.I mentioned to my friends how I thought it was bizarre that edibles give me anxiety but MDMA does not. They anecdotally told me that edibles are harder to handle.Some people will shit on the idea and say it's not worth it, but there can be value in taking a small dose. For example, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/8dv04x/prepping_for_my_wifes_first_roll_tonight_wish_us/dxs3bgc/) a user told us about how his wife took only 75 mg of MDMA and "enjoyed every minute of it." (Note that she weighs 60 kg = 132 lb.)If you try it out, make sure to test your stuff with a reagent. If you don't have a reagent, order it soon to make sure you have it before edc. If you're not ready to try MDMA, or if you never will be ready, that's cool too. Only do it if you really want to. [info] None [info] 1524701629
sushi-suspect [info] I'm obviously no expert, but I agree, reading this did not give me an ADHD vibe. Though, I coped pretty well with mine for most of my life and did okay. OP, SHS psych diagnosed me with ADHD (inattentive type) last year and the med I was put on changed my life. I was diagnosed with anxiety as a teen, but it's not so bad that I medicate for it - though my anxiety spikes when my ADHD symptoms are heightened, they're intertwined for me. Controlling my ADHD controls my anxiety, but medicating for anxiety never controlled my ADHD.I was seeing my SHS GP who tried to manage my symptoms (treated me mostly for anxiety) for a few months, but he put in a psych referral for me the first time I saw him. My psychiatrist diagnosed me quickly, but said it was obvious. The wait list is pretty awful for psych so if you're looking into it I'd start ASAP, get on the list before the next school year starts.

Bmore_sunny [info] Sensory issues at night Hi, a bit unusual situation here. For the past six months I've had what I would call disruptive sensory issues in most evenings. I feel itchy all over, can't relax, feels like my skin is crawling. It only happens at night and I'm fine during the day. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and it's been pretty under control. I don't have anxiety at night anymore, but when it's 2am and I can't sleep but know I have to get ready for work at 7am, I begin to get very emotional and anxious. At first I thought it was a medication causing the sensory issues and restlessness, but I went off the meds a month ago. My doc has suggested taking Benadryl or another sleep aid, and although I don't want to take more medications, it's the only thing that helps.I've tried things like changing my sheets often, being very picky about shirts I wear to sleep, and even turn my clothes inside out so that the seams and tags don't bother me. It helps a little. I've tried showering at night, body oil, lotion, weighted blanket, nature sounds and meditation music, humidifier. I use a detergent that is fragrance free. It's winter now, so not too many allergens. I use a special mattress cover that helps with dust mites.  Nothing I try helps. I think it's strange it only happens at night, which makes me think I don't have a sensory disorder, but I don't know what else to call it.**All this to say... Any suggestions of what I can use to relieve my discomfort at night? Or anyone have a similar experience? Thank you in advance!** [info] None [info] 1574229794
hahabyeeee [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was 9, ADHD when I was 11. I took an SSRI and adderall for 8 years. Adderall never caused anxiety.  I now am 20 and take Wellbutrin and adderall and my anxiety is horrible. I took 25mg when I was younger. The past year I took 15mg, and now I’m down to 10mg due to the bad anxiety it causes me. I can only take it on days that I have to do school work because it just causes unnecessary anxiety for me. It was giving me chest pains at 15mg, the 10 is better but the doctor said that we can lower it to 5mg if necessary. I’d ask the doctor if you could try Strattera which is a non-stimulant adhd medication. It does not increase anxiety, but i think it takes 6 weeks to get into your system. But, if you’ve managed the adhd symptoms for the past 9 years I think an extra 6 weeks wouldn’t be too bad to wait for medication to take effect. Your doctor also might want a new diagnosis. I started seeing a new psychiatrist this year and my adhd diagnosis was 9 years old so he wanted me to get a new one before prescribing any controlled substances. Good luck!

kazoodles [info] I'm not able to empathize entirely nor am I religious, but I can see why you would fear over blaspheming by consuming this kind of content. A lot of SMT concepts are based on real life beliefs and practices, such as the belief that YHVH isn't in fact the perfect creator god or demon summoning. I mention the former solely because it seems like a really common theme in any game that he's mentioned. Anyone on the chaos or neutral side of things hints towards the diversity of gods which in turn is a rejection of monotheism and more specifically, YHVH's rejection of lesser gods. --I experience similar feelings, albeit they're probably not relate-able. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and psychosis 2 years ago which I believe started as a result of me dabbling in the occult as well as already having a predisposition to anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Getting into SMT has helped me by exposing myself to material that would previously send me into panic attacks. I remember playing Persona 3 for the first time two decembers ago and slightly shaking throughout the experience because of the demon names. Now the intrusive thoughts aren't as common and recently I've been getting anxiety about it likely because I just switched medication. I used to think that I was being possessed or that god would punish me(at the moment of the panic attack), although I didn't in reality believe in either of those things. It's easy to develop fears or worries related to these games if you're religious regardless of whether you see it as just fiction. But I doubt any christian would feel entirely comfortable with wanting to punch god in the face, especially considering how close to detail he's portrayed thematically in most of the games. Even if it were blasphemous in some weird, convoluted way God loves you and knows you don't have malicious intentions.  [info]  [info] 1479787341
FamousBlueRaincoat37 [info] Hi, I was diagnosed with MS on Thursday after roughly 9 years of symptoms. I only went to a neurologist in October last year because I started falling over. From reading people's posts it seems I'm lucky that a diagnosis only took 5 months and most of that was waiting for various tests. I have many o bands in my csf, lesions in my c spine and too many lesions to count in my brain. My main symptom for the last 9 years has been tingling/pins and needles/numbness in my legs and torso. I also had the occasional episode of feacal and urinary incontinence. I just got used to the tingling feeling and buried my head in the sand, not wanting to face up to what was wrong. For years it stayed the same but last summer it ramped up. I couldn't walk without my legs feeling like they were buzzing or vibrating, my arms would buzz or tingle randomly and I had a few falls at work. Looking back, just before all the weird sensations started I got a really painful left eye. If I moved it (can't stop it moving) it caused such a sickening sharp pain. I also couldn't move it to the left and see at the same time. My vision seemed ok, maybe a bit blurry, except for when I closed my right eye and looked to the left I realised I couldn't see properly. I wasn't diagnosed with optic neuritis but I'm convinced it was a mild case of it. I was prescribed glasses with a 2x stronger lens on the left side. I couldn't wear them because they gave me a headache and made me feel sick. Subsequent appointments at the opticians have shown I don't need glasses at all, let alone a different strength for my left eye! The pain went after a couple of weeks and I thought my vision was back to normal. A few years later when learning to drive I realised I couldn't read the number plate in front of me properly, it was all blurry. Since then I've had intermittent   blurriness which is more noticeable at work. Sometimes I can read the patient board, sometimes I can't. Again I just buried my head in the sand and ignored it. So I guess I've been quite similar to you, pins and needles and blurry vision for years. I would ask for an MRI to get started on finding a cause. Its so easy to ignore things that are wrong with our bodies and we start to believe it's just normal or 'just how I am'.Oh, and like you, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and last week I had what my neuro said was a flare up. Numb face, tingling and numbness, burning in my arm, dizziness  and my GP told me it was anxiety! I've known since January that I have lesions in my c spine so I asked " is it nothing to do with my spinal cord then?" And he told me no, definitely not! I wasn't even anxious, just pissed off with waiting for results from the LP and brain MRI!Once you've been diagnosed with anxiety it magically become to cause of all your ailments!Good luck with finding out what's going on with you and push as hard as you can for investigations.

Stuckinmyhead13 [info] Coming off ssri s I wrote this is r/antidepressants, but wondering if anyone else experienced this. I've been on and off ssris a good chunk of my life. I was diagnosed with anxiety and pure o obsessions. I've tried just about every ssri out there. One thing I noticed is the widthdrawal and tapering off them., everyone I've talked to says it's the worst thing coming off these meds. I'm totally opposite in the sense that I get ZERO effects. I could stop cold turkey after taking them a year and zero withdrawal effects. No nausea, vomit, sleep, jitters, all the bad effects... Is this normal? I can skip a dosage for several days and nothing will happen. [info] None [info] 1540568691
CyanHalo [info] Yes, I've been diagnosed with anxiety/adhd for 15 years and was diagnosed ptsd from witnessing several overdoses and near deaths of my ex husband. My daughter is only 4 but she does display similar symptoms that I had when I was a child with both anxiety and adhd. I'm not jumping to conclusions with her and it hasn't gotten to the point in which I feel like she needs to be checked out for it. I'm lucky to be able to work from home the vast majority of the time so I would be there to make sure that the animals had exercise and training. I'd also like to have both of them trained to be service animals. I'm willing to invest in it financially for both to get them trained correctly. I'm picking out not "favorite" animals necessarily but I have had this planned since 2012 with the pig and was just waiting until both of my dogs had the end of life with no new animals being spoiled. I have wanted a pig due to the intelligence and longer life span. My daughter has wanted a husky since she first saw one. I hear what you guys are saying and I get it. I am sure that its an imposition to not only have me and my kid there but my animals there for them. Even if they don't have any responsibilities for them, its the principle I think you're really meaning that is the issue. In my brain, I'm all justifying it because I'll be there or bringing them to the office with me 100% of the time. I also justified it because my sheepdog was massive with even more hair and the most hyper dog that I've ever encountered until late in life. I understand by hearing your feedback that regardless of the justifications, its the principle and a respect thing. So, if I was to get 1. The pig would certainly be smaller than a husky and I'd be able to litter box train or adopt one that already is. In my head that means it would be the better option. However, I think the pig word for the parents is an unknown and that is more of a concern.What do you think is the best compromise for the time being? You are right and I should compromise. I'm picking out not "favorite" animals necessarily but I have had this planned since 2012 with the pig and was just waiting until both of my dogs had the end of life with no new animals being spoiled.

orbitofnormal [info] BF (27m) and I (26f) don’t talk as much, I’m still VERY happy but also anxious Basically what it says in the title, but I can add more details. My BF and I met on an app in September, and have officially been a couple since mid-Dec. we both like the same things (same TV shows/movies, same sense of humor, weird science, cooking.....) and have the same general plans/values (wanting to be married SOMEDAY, kids IN THE FUTURE, hard working, close to our families). We see each other multiple times a week when our schedules work, at least one weeknight and one weekend thing, and text through the day. Lately, I’ve noticed that while we’re seeing each other in person more often, we seem to be talking less. In the big picture this doesn’t bother me, because it’s a big deal for me to want to be around someone without having to be “on” for them, if that makes sense. BF has become one of the few people I have where I’m happier having him around, even if we’re sitting on the couch together reading our own books or just cuddling watching GoT. I’d noticed a few mo the ago that he is definitely a bit more of a social person than me, with multiple large groups of friends that he’s always juggling his schedule around. We talked about it when I mentioned giggling a bit when he said something about how we “haven’t gone out in a while” when we’d gone our to dinner 3 days before and a friend’s party last week, and I realized he meant a “just us” thing. So I think our communication and expectations for each other are pretty darn healthy. But there’s a voice in the back of my head that is making me worry because I don’t think we’re talking as much, idk if that’s true overall or just in chunks. I remember when we first started dating that we could talk for 2+ hours without stopping, but then this week we went out to dinner and talked about our crazy work weeks, but I think over 50% of the time we were at the restaurant we were quiet. I was very happy to just with there with him and enjoy the beautiful weather and good food, but I’m also worried that this means something is wrong. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago, so I fully recognize this could just be that ugliness rearing its head. And my parents have been married for almost 30 years and can be exactly like this, so I know it’s not necessarily a death knell on the relationship. But this is my first real relationship (I identify as demisexual, I literally haven’t been close enough to someone to want a relationship with them until the current BF), so anything that seems “weird” also scares the pants off me because I don’t want to lose him.

Zaitlinspf [info] How did yall push past your anxiety to be able to talk to new people? Currently a college freshman and struggling with making friends. I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was 5 but my family never really did much besides tell me I was just being being anxious and needed to get over my shyness. (Family is better about mental health though as I've gotren older).I had a hard time in highschool making friends till highschool where I found my clique and we all stuck together. Now I'm on my own and have 1 new friend and 1 from my highschool. I try to talk to people in class but feel myself hold back as I feel like the person isn't interested or feel like I talked to much or that they think I'm weird. I also started catching that I lightly stutter or slur my words now and I have no idea how that started or how to make it stop. And I just feel like I'm holding myself back from something so easy. I really want to meet new people so I've tried to join clubs and just didn't like the vibe of the groups. I'm now trying to talk to classmates to try and make a friend. But I suck at keeping a conversation going without feeling weird and anxious.How did yall get over your social anxiety? Or at least push through it?

psychonaut1220 [info] Should I try LSD again? I’ve tried mushrooms countless times in the past, MDMA recently, I smoke weed quite frequently, and LSD once. I am diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. The last time I tripped on LSD I took an extremely massive bong rip during the comeup, and that lead to the peak coming on like a bus which lead to a panic attack. Once the panic attack subsided I still had a great time, and woke up with an afterglow. That was the first panic attack I’ve ever had, and then I had a second one which happened pretty recently from smoking a lot of a very suspicious thc cartridge. I am not prone to panic attacks sober and never have had them from weed or shrooms or mdma except that one cartridge incident. Would it be safe for me to try LSD again? I have been really wanting to drop one tab of 105ug, the same dose I took last time. I don’t plan on smoking this time. [info] None [info] 1584661714
Madame_Kitsune98 [info] I can have conversations, but sometimes I do draw a blank. It’s a little difficult at times.At the concussion clinic I was finally referred to? It was explained to me that if you had issues with things like anxiety, OCD, or ADHD before the concussion, they’re going to be somewhat worse afterwards. Well. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. My family practitioner, who is an APRN, and I sat down and filled out a questionnaire, and I likely have ADHD, but we never could get me in to see the psychiatrist to do testing for ADHD. So, I have four thousand browser tabs open in my brain, but jumping between them, there’s lag.I’m easily irritated.

Yeah, anxiety still attacks but I've learned how to deal with it. I think even diagnosis can lead to some using it as an excuse in life.

BloodEngel666 [info] Concerned I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was younger but it was a bit of a gray area because I have mild autism, so random stuff would set me into a meltdown. As I entered high school my anxiety persisted as nausea, Shakes, and a feeling of total doom. My day would be fucked if one happened but it only happened when faced with emotional stress, like seeing an ex.I got kicked out recently and got my meds filled on the first of October. My anxiety was out of control, it felt, and I burned through my "take as needed" gabapentin in two weeks. They barely helped even though they used to do the job very well, they mostly helped me calm down a bit enough to sleep or stop shaking. But things changed. I stopped getting nauseous and the last three days have been very very stressful on me. I'm concerned because now there's something...else? I think it could be anxiety but its not acting the way it usually does.I got wide eyed, my eyes dilate, my focus hits adderall levels, I get obsessive, my thoughts take a negative turn, I grind my teeth, I talk fast, and I shake very bad. I also can't sleep at ALL. Over the last three days ive gotten maybe 6 hours of sleep. It feels like I'm stimmed out from the adderall but that is not possible, I take my XR dose at 6am every day so it wears off at 6pm and I can eat and sleep.I tried everything to get some sleep, melatonin in huge doses and in super small doses. I tried benadryl, kratom, weed, doxylamine, zzquil, chugging beer...nothing can calm me down anymore. I don't understand whats happening. I fucked up bad yesterday because my Gf relapsed and selfharmed, she came to me for help and I ended up getting obsessive about random shit and pushed it, ending in her blocking me. I didn't even know I was in this strange mental state! I couldn't control it at all and it took my best friend confronting me to ask if I had any anxiety meds.I couldn't control myself, I didnt notice I was like that. Then today I went to go donate plasma and got turned down because my heart rate was stupid high. It wasnt the adderall, I hadn't had any caffeine, I hadn't smoked a cigarette. They literally asked me if I was feeling okay and if I was having a panic attack. I can't feel it at all. The only thing stressful about today was that I had to go talk to my mom about babysitting my grandmother. I don't know what's going on and I'm afraid to mention it to my aunt because when it happens, I look *fucked up*. It suddenly makes sense why they keep pushing if I'm on anything.

Bananasticker642 [info] Thank you for your comment. I have been diagnosed with anxiety from my doctor a few years ago.  For the most part I have it under control and am no longer taking any medication. But for this, my main problem is just the unknown. I know medically what sleep apnea is, but that doesn't help with the everyday part. I was just looking for real life stories to get a better idea of what happens during a sleep study and how people deal with a CPAP everyday.Like... how are the wires attached to your head? Do they pull your hair? I am very tenderheaded. Do they visually watch you while you sleep (on camera or something), or is it just when the machines go offline they come in?

Block every news source.  Don't follow people who post about stuff you don't want to see (I unfollowed EVERYONE that talked about politics in any way during elections, I unfollow everyone that posts sad animals or crazy news stories).

takeitslowinnyc [info] I'm diagnosed with anxiety and was previously on anti-anxiety meds. I go to weekly therapy and have made tremendous progress. A big problem I still have is always thinking ahead/looking to the future vs being present in the now. It's something I'm actively trying to work on, especially since I'm pregnant now (baby was a happy surprise) but it's HARD. I don't want to keep "wishing away the present" but I feel like I've just been so anxious for the next doc appt. Even getting my betas done twice, I was an anxious wreck. Last week we saw baby for the first time (it's doing well, yay) and already I'm counting down the days to our next ultrasound next month so I can make sure it's still there and ok.

CyberCrap [info] I'm so tired. I cant with my anxiety anymore.Ever since I was diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago I feel like it's been getting worse, I swear sometimes I feel as if I cant even breath right, I'm so scared to just even go to sleep cause I fear not waking up, I have to wait till I'm so tired that I can't even think to go to sleep. Recently just even throwing up from eating something that was bad makes me scared for my life even though I accept that it's nothing. Being alone scares the shit out me, at school my anxiety attacks would be cured by my friends but since moving that hasn't been an option and I'm not the best at making friends. Sometimes I think things are happening that really aren't. I try to distract my self but it only works for a bit, I just want to be able to live and fall asleep without worrying excessively, and be able to watch or read the news without having a panic attack because I think the world is ending. I just wanna be able to do things. And focus on school and my dreams. I haven't been to a therapist since I got diagnosed but I plan to see one as soon as school starts. tl:dr, my anxiety is really bad recently and I just wanna cry. [info] None [info] 1566792686

bosfton [info] Yeah, I definitely see where you’re coming from. I guess I feel like my friends don’t even offer help maybe that means my friendship isn’t worth much to them. I am very shy and hate public speaking too but I would do it for a friend.  I asked a bridesmaid if she could do the speech instead and she immediately said yes like “If you mean like gush about our friendship and what it means to me to be there then I can totally do that, I’ll write it up tonight”. That was more what I thought a normal friend would be like.   My MOH and I have been best friends for over 20 years, I am diagnosed with anxiety and take medication for it as well I get that, but for me I’d view it as “well this is really scary and intimidating but this is my best friend we are talking about and it would make her happy so I’ll just say something brief”.  Hell I feel that way about the wedding ceremony and the first dance— I am shy and bad at dancing but my fiancé thought that a first dance would be sweet and they are commonly done at weddings so I sucked it the fuck up and learned even though I’m terrified. Part of life is forcing yourself outside of your comfort zone sometimes. I realize it’s not my place so that’s why I won’t force her to talk but it hurts she doesn’t wanna make any effort when I would have for her. Also I think she forgot about the speech because she said “I thought there wasn’t going to be toasts” and when I dug out the old chat log of her agreeing to give a toast she said “yeah I thought I could do it back when it was something in the future” and started saying stuff like “well a MOH speech isn’t required so it’s okay”.

LadyMorte [info] I'm tempted to check myself in somewhere... [Help] I have a lot going on.... not even sure where to start.  I don't even know if I can go into detail because I'm worried about all the judgment and everyone telling me how I should have done everything differently.Things have come to a head a couple of times recently and I'm scared I'm going to shut down.  I missed work once last week because I couldn't pull it together in time to go in.I am not sure what to do with myself anymore.*****************Background:I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year and a half ago.  Been on Zoloft ever since and sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't.I got (unlawfully) fired from my main job and lost my home (my apartment was part of the job payment).  I had two weeks to move out over Christmas break.  I tried to appeal this to the board and they upheld the director's decision.  My boyfriend was fired at the same time and we both ended up homeless.There are several lawsuits pending over the firing - both on their end (for rent) and ours (unlawful discrimination, illegal payment practice, etc).I lost my lawsuit over the rent when my lawyer was suspended from the bar and didn't inform me... I had to attempt to defend myself and now the court has ruled I owe almost $2000.I was being paid $500/month for the job (yeah, it's becoming a real issue since I worked full time hours and was on call) and had no savings... I'm several thousand dollars in debt now from the unexpected move to a new apartment.  I've lived out of my car before and that terrified me worse than the debt.My boyfriend and I aren't getting along well... we are both under a lot of stress and I'm frustrated with the relationship.We both have new full time gigs but money is tight and he isn't as good at keeping up with spending as I am.We both got puppies to train as therapy dogs... I was careful to pick out the temperament I needed and I love her but I feel like I never have any time with her because of work. I'm afraid I'm not working with her enough and she won't be able to pass the Caning Good Citizen test.After a mishap where my boyfriend forgot to show me a bill for a deposit and we almost had the water cut off and I had to pull almost $200 out of thin air, I feel like I'm losing it completely.  I almost didn't make it into work tonight.  I can't keep functioning as an adult.  I'm 25 and in a worse position than I was 3 years ago.  I feel like any hope of a future is gone.  I'm not suicidal, but I'm not functional anymore either.  My plans to have a house and a real career are all so far out of reach again that I have no idea how to get them back.  I was doing something I loved and now I'm black listed from that profession... I'm afraid I'm going to lose my lawsuits and not be able to get back on my feet and back into that field.I'm drowning in the doubt and self hatred and I don't know how to get out of it.EDIT: My neighbor also called the cops yesterday morning because our dogs supposedly have barked the last three nights in a row from 10 pm-4 am... I am not handling this stress well either.  We both work nights and the last two nights we had been at work... the night before I was home all night and they NEVER made a peep.  We are recording them tonight to see if there is any barking... I'm terrified to go home in an hour because I am scared there will be another note on our door. [info] None [info] 1399863685
Mac987654 [info] The Chimp Paradox by Prof. Steve Peters I'd highly recommend this book for anyone struggling with anxiety or who needs a better understanding of their mind.The cover does look like your usual self-help, but it gives a lot of very practical advice on dealing with your emotions and feelings, or what he refers to as the 'chimp'.In the 8 or so years I've been diagnosed with anxiety, this is the first book I turn back to when I need a reminder on what's going on in my brain.'Why do I sometimes become so irrational in my thinking? It is not you thinking at all, but your chimp taking over and thinking for you. The solution therefore is to understand how your chimp thinks, recognise when it is taking over, and intervene.'Hope it helps! [info] None [info] 1549232403

hp007 [info] Does anyone else obsess over going to the bathroom? Okay, I’m posting this just because I’m curious. I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD in 2013 and the main way it manifests is going to the bathroom. I am always afraid that I’m basically about to pee on myself. I’m afraid of going on long car rides, I research new places I’m going to to make sure they have a bathroom there, if I see a bathroom I’m stopping to pee. I’ve been driving and had to find a store and literally ran so fast into the bathroom with my heart pounding that I was about to have an accident, only to sit down and barely have anything in me. Lately it’s progressed a little bit to pooping as well. I’m always afraid something I’ve eaten is going to upset my stomach and I’m going to have an accident. I have never heard of anyone with this compulsion, and I was curious if any of you have faced it. I’m feeling excited because I just finished breastfeeding and am about to go back on medication. I’m really hoping it will help me. I’m in a wedding in several months and I really don’t want to be standing up there just worried about having an accident so I really hope I find a good medical solution soon! Thanks for reading all about my weird OCD! [info] None [info] 1581206678
roxychick4327 [info] I am on the verge of making a big move myself (although not quite as far) as well as starting a new job. I also have a 7 year old who is making this move with me and I fear repercussions of it not working out so much. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I know the feeling. Every day the move draws nearer I need to talk myself out of talking myself out of it all. For every negative, anxiety filled thought I remind myself of something in my current life I want to be different and how this move is going to help me accomplish that. I never let myself dwell in fear too long if I can help it. Sometimes I fail, but sometimes I succeed. Make a list of pros. Refer back to it when you get scared. Immediately following every scared thought with a small positive is something I've tried to train myself to do. Honestly, sometimes it's the little things like I think about how my new apartment has a fireplace and I've always wanted a fireplace. It sounds so juvenile, but it works. Think about how no real reward comes without risk. The discomfort of the move is only temporary. Your new definition of normal will set in. All of us have the ability to adapt. I would hate to think that you or I didn't succeed just because we were too scared to try. [info] None [info] 1452932222

CherryBlossom490 [info] Horrible, untrue thoughts pop into my head I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was very young. I had some challenges with it throughout my life. However, this has got to be my most anxiety inducing experiences yet. And I hadn’t told ANYONE until now.At random, I would get these horrible thoughts about me doing, saying, or being something I would ever DARE do/say/be. These thoughts want me to be very cruel to my friends or do something highly unethical and illegal. I want to be a kind and gentle person, not a cruel and nasty bitch! These thought seem to be trying to make me go against my very nature at heart.I always try to fight back with thoughts that say the opposite of what the bad thoughts tell me. And it’s getting harder and harder each time. Sometimes the anxiety is so bad that I feel like I can’t walk. Other times my head hurts from the stress.This has been going on for, I think, a few months now. And this is without telling anyone due to the fear of accidentally conveying the wrong message and damaging a lot of my relationships and my reputation. I’m sick of fighting this. I just want peace!

GreatGateway [info] Assumed I had asthma until just this week - debilitating symptoms keeping me down. For the last 10 years or slightly more, I have suffered from unusual symptoms that have caused me to lose jobs, money and independence all around. Initially I was diagnosed with anxiety, and then asthma, however I'm finding none of the medication, including rescue inhalers, helps me. In some cases it actually worsens my symptoms!I feel very tight and squeezy in my chest, easily breathless, sometimes nauseous OR dizzy, and I get frequent headaches, vision problems and disturbed sleep. My legs can feel like they're swelling up even when they aren't and I may sometimes get pins and needles in my hands and face.To be honest I'm terrified of it being to do with my heart as it can get worse after some exercise, particularly sexual activity. I have a phobia of heart problems, even mentioning the word makes me anxious, so I beg and pray from the information provided that it isn't to do with that! [info] Patient [info] 1531932379

The_Zoinkster [info] I’m at the lowest point of my life right now because of this virus. Please read this whole thing to really understand how I’m feeling right now.I’ve never been so scared in my life honestly. I know darn well that I am probably the most likely to be fine in my family, but I still have that feeling of “what if i Don’t?” I also worry so much about my family. I don’t think I could ever move on if I lost someone in my family. We don’t have many people in our family that really care about us except my parents, my brother, and my grandparents. Everyone else in my family is a piece of shit to us. I don’t want to lose them.This whole thing is scary. I’m 18 and have never seen anything like this. Places are shutting down, roads are empty, finding food is hard, we’re barely surviving on the toilet paper that we have. I’m tired of being in this house quarantined. I don’t want to be trapped in here for a few months. It feels like a fucking apocalypse. I never saw anything like this with Ebola or other diseases. The number of cases just keep getting bigger and bigger. My state so far has 200 or so cases last I checked, and I’m afraid it’s not going to stop. What if the virus mutates and becomes more deadly? What if emit kills everyone else that I love? I’ve had such bad anxiety attacks. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorders when I was younger and had meds and I’ve been off them for about 3 years now, but I need them again. But I don’t want to go out there in any buildings other than my own house. I have just broken down and cried a couple times this week because of everything that’s been going on. I barely get any sleep over this 5 hours a night if I’m lucky. I can’t even enjoy the things I love doing most like video games right now.I’m terrified, I don’t know what to do, I’m at the lowest point that I have ever been in life right now and I need help.

squirrlythebish [info] I am at a loss... To preface my tale, I should mention that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. A friend and I stayed at a hotel last weekend. We put our stuff down (I had a small suitcase, which was standing upright on the floor), and we went to dinner. When we got back, we got into bed. Right away, she noticed some (3) bugs. They varied in size, but they resembled bed bugs. Either way, we weren't risking it. We immediately got out of there. We stayed at a nearby hotel for the night, and then, we headed to her home the next day. First thing we did when we got home was wash and dry on high heat our clothes.Didn't notice anything, but I now can't stop panicking. I've been obsessively Googling things, reading this sub, etc. I constantly feel itchy on random parts of my body, and now, I can't sleep.Tonight, I felt something crawling on me, and I freaked. My husband looked at it, and he said it looked like a stink bug. We had found a similar one the other day on our bedroom ceiling.Still, though, I don't know what to do. Am I going crazy?

PastelCake491 [info] Am I ESFJ or ENFJ? Maybe even another type! Am I ENFJ Or ESFJ? Maybe Even Another Type!First of all, I am stuck in between these types because:•I relate both to Ni and Si, and notice myself using both, sometimes even at the same time!•In tests, I usually get ENFJ, but with sort of strong Si (and Ne), but in some of them I do get ESFJ, mainly in the shorter ones.•I have asked people, in a page of cognitive functions I made that I showed my family and friends (it was around 9 people) My parents: ENFJMy mom said Ni because since I was little, I liked to play with patterns and connections and I have always liked finding the deeper meaning of things. My dad said Ni over Si because “I grab things from the future, not from the past”.2 Friends: ESFJ1 Friend: ENFP 2 Friends: ENFJ (one of those is the one who I have told the most about MBTI, and she has this belief I am ENFJ, and doesn’t let it go)1 Of My Siblings: ESFJThat Makes: 1 ENFP3 ESFJs4 ENFJsThen, I showed my mom a picture which contrasts ESFJ vs ENFJ, cognitive wise, and she said ESFJ. I showed her Ni vs Si and she said Si.Now, I’m still young so my auxiliary function is just developing. But I will explain my Si and Ni! Using the 4 letters, I am an ENFP. Si:I’m not the biggest fan of change, it depends on the kind of change. I don’t prioritize tradition but bothmy dad and mom said I’m more of a detail oriented person rather than big picture, but I’m not sure. I am not a fan of routines, I would definitely get bored from doing the same thing all over again, which is why school days are boring. But, I do sometimes find myself giving advices based on my past experiences and even though I use a lot of metaphors, my day to day speaking doesn’t involve a lot of them. I don’t have the most detailed memory, but I do remember various things that happened to me when I was little and find myself using examples from both the past or imagination. I sometimes think about the past, usually things that had lead me to be insecure and I find myself thinking of what I could have done differently in certain situations. I don’t have the best short term memory but my long term one isn’t a mess. I do look up to past experiences, even though they’re not my top priority. Ni:Even though people don’t notice it, I can be very deep and arrive at insights, I analyze some things unconsciously so I suddenly have these random moments of realization. I am very future oriented. I was diagnosed with anxiety so I don’t know if this is just my anxiety, but I tend to get very paranoid and overthink stuff.I like getting to the deeper meanings of things and enjoy the abstract. I am creative but not good at brainstorming and prefer thinking and processing my ideas before letting them out, though I sometimes can be pretty random and say the first thins that come to my mind when I’m with people that make me feel comfortable. I use metaphors but don’t really include them that much. I enjoy abstract thinking and analyzing situations that lead me to maybe a theory. For example, while making theories, I usually just make one and stick to it. I have just one goal, and I enjoy working to get that one goal instead of having multiple ones. I usually think of one possible outcome, or idea, sometimes I think of more but usually stick to one. I am pretty abstract and usually have hunches that turn out to be true. (Like for example, one time I was playing a game and since the beginning I had this idea that I was going to win, and I did!) I usually just know things without really knowing how to explaining. But, I do have trouble deciding, and I’m usually just like “idk, what do you want?”, which could be a sign of trickster Ni, which means tertiary Ne, auxiliary Si. I don’t think about the long term future, I rather stick to daydreaming and thinking about the short term future.I hope you can help me if you want! And I hope this was not too long! :) [info] None [info] 1556991773

_robynn_ [info] :( I’m so sorry. I didn’t know I was being cruel or that I was hurting you. I just honestly thought that when you said appointment you actually meant an appointment. I didn’t know you didn’t mean what you said. I saw how you got angry and it really does scare me. I don’t feel safe when you’re mad. Sofia was also very scared when you were hitting things with the frying pan. She is too young to understand that you have problems and she blames herself for you being mad. I blame myself for you being mad too, but I know it is my fault. The reason I don’t like getting close to people is because you have convinced me that I’m a terrible person. I care too much about people to get close to them because I’m convinced that I’m a terrible person and no one would ever want to be my friend. You called me cruel for not understanding that when you said “appointment” you actually meant “performance.” I know it’s my fault so please stop yelling and hitting me. It really hurts. Even though I am diagnosed with anxiety you are convinced that I don’t have it so I stopped taking my medicine because if I don’t have it I wouldn’t need my medicine. My anxiety has gotten so much worse because I’m not taking my medicine but I know that I’m faking it so I’ll just deal with it. I’m a pathetic human. I’m sorry I’m not able to help you with shopping and I’m sorry I waste your time because you have to pick me up from school. I know that I’m a burden and that I would be better off dead, please stop reminding me. I know I deserve all of this for coming into your life and costing you a lot of medical bills. I know you want me to die but I’m too scared and selfish to go through another suicide attempt. I know that makes me pathetic. I know I’m worthless. Please please please please stop hurting me.

allthesnacks [info] Are misdiagnosis of Anxiety and OCD common for folks with ADHD? I have no diagnosis for ADHD myself although I display many of the symptoms which are identical to my brothers who actually was recently diagnosed with ADHD. However, when I went in displaying the same symptoms I was diagnosed with anxiety and OCD. I'm 29/F and I'm wondering if others also had this experience. I'm on Zoloft which has helped with the anxiety but nothing else. I'll be going in for a second opinion soon. [info] None [info] 1506899125
kefern [info] &gt;I'm open to the idea that this is "just" anxiety. Never really been an anxious person though.Same here, but I was diagnosed with anxiety way before I have experienced these weird symptoms that made me even more worried as it could be some other underlying issue like you said which could potentially be something serious. Have you tried seeing a neurologist? I'm probably going to do that soon.Also, how are your ears? Apparently most issues with balance disorders are due to some infection or issue in the ear. However, I'm not a doctor but I don't see how an ear infection could have such a profound impact or relation on the heart. Secondly most ear infections presumably also cause actual vertigo, spinning or some sort of dizziness, which both of us do not have. It's truly puzzling. [info] None [info] 1522155411

rachiedoubt [info] I struggle with pretty severe anxiety. I have PTSD &amp; generalized anxiety and often experience panic attacks. One of the main symptoms for me is heart palpitations. They are such a normal part of my life now that I often just ignore them. I used to get scared to work out or get my heart rate up too high, because they were more likely to happen then, and having the palpitations would make me worry I was about to have a panic attack (because they often happened before or during a panic attack). I had to train my brain to understand that just because I have a heart palpitation here and there from anxiety doesn't mean I'm about to have a full blown attack. The more I can live my normal life through these things, the more my brain doesn't react in fear when I have these symptoms and other certain ones that usually signify anxiety.I went to a doctor and had an EKG when I first experienced these issues and they told me my heart was perfectly healthy. Later on I was diagnosed with anxiety. I'm not saying that this will happen to you, there's no way to know until you speak to a doctor. But this has been my experience with heart palpitations. I know a handful of people who have had these symptoms and did have another issue that wasn't anxiety, but it can definitely be caused by anxiety and just simply stress as someone else mentioned. I hope you feel better soon. [info]  [info] 1466323720

myparadog [info] I had a kinda similar experience with the ADHD episode but I have to give some background first. So this will be a long post. You can skip this middle part it just kinda explains how I used to think.I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 12. Meds were thrown at me without any real explanation so I fought back hard. I’m very stubborn and strong willed. Something I’ve apparently inherited from my dad. For better or worse. I’m very logical in my thinking though. I have to have evidence and proof and then I’ll make up my own mind about things. I wasn’t given that and was told I had to take these pills. So I fought to the point of hiding and throwing away pills until my mom gave up trying to fight me. Nothing was ever explained as to why I had to take them. It was just said that it will make it easier to concentrate. That wasn’t a good enough reason for me. Then at 13 right before 8th grade I was taken to a psychologist or something. I don’t really remember. My grades were all over the place from 6th and 7th grade and my mom was concerned I would end up failing 8th because they changed the grading scale. They had actually changed it in my favor come to find out but that didn’t save me from being dragged quite angrily to this appointment, where my mom, dad, and I were told the same thing from the previous year. They gave me the same prescription but a stronger dose and sent me on my way. I was livid. That proscription never made it to the pharmacy. Later that day I went in my mom’s purse where the prescription was sticking out, I took it out and shoved it under the tree rack thingy. My mom confronted a few days later when she remembered about needing to drop off the prescription. She asked me if I threw it away. Which I told her I didn’t. Which wasn’t technically lying. She eventually let it go because she didn’t want to keep fighting and I put up a good front on trying to “help” her find it. I can be devious when I need to be. I waited months before actually throwing the prescription away. I had more trouble with school that year but mostly because of my previous teachers just being horrible. The 2 previous years I had very vindictive science teachers. One even shut a door in my face and later yelled at me because of something a “friend” said about another “friend”. Middle school was horrible! Between feuding friends, teachers yelling at me for no reason, and slamming doors in my face is a miracle I ever did pass.Now I’m about to be 30 at the end of this month. All that was back in 2001-2003. I’ve been through a lot since then that has opened my mind to all kinds of things but it wasn’t until I heard the ADHD episode where I was kinda able to diagnose myself (knowing I had already been professionally diagnosed) but it was explained in greater detail and firsthand experience was given. That had never been explained to me like that before. It was pushed on me as a reason I was failing classes. When in reality I don’t think that was everything. In all honesty I really do love my ADHD tendencies it’s very freeing and I can be super creative, the meds stopped that. Which I told them I didn’t like but I was a kid and ignored. I never thought they did enough investigation into what I was really going through. They just wanted a quick fix and I wasn’t going to get the fast food treatment. December 31, 2018  after 2 weeks of anxiety attacks every other day I was diagnosed with anxiety. The day previous I nearly lost my job over an anxiety attack caused by my manager. I’m on Prozac now and I’ve never felt better. I honestly think the anxiety had more of an effect on me than anything else I faced. Even as a kid it was crippling back then at times. I missed a lot of school because I couldn’t face being around people some days. To know what’s truly going on and able to put a name to it, not a label or excuse, but to really know there’s a way to help... I’ve also taken quiz prior to all this that say I show 66% OCD tendencies and after listening to Stuff You Should Know’s episode on Dyslexia, I have some of those symptoms as well. It’s a good episode and goes into detail about it and it not what most think it is because those with it have a hard time explaining exactly what’s going on and it effects everyone differently.I’ve always been smart and can be taught anything... as long as it’s taught in a way I understand. I am notorious for hearing or reading a sentence and can’t understand it unless it’s explained in a different way. But even if I don’t it’s still something worth looking into because it could lead to understanding something else about myself.Sorry for such a long post I totally did mean to write all that but I kept thinking of things to add. I say all that though because I totally understand how empowering it can be to really understand yourself. [info] None [info] 1552441715

xuchy [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was about 10 years old. Just like Bill, I wish I could have known about mindfulness and had access to other methods back then aside from medication. My attacks were just as crippling as they were numerous - at one point causing me to miss several weeks of school in my senior year. Almost two decades later, I finally feel as though I'm regaining control of myself through daily meditation, exercise, cognitive therapy, and a better dosage of my meds. If you're in the same boat as Bill, myself, and many others in this thread: keep moving forward and remember you are not alone. You are so much more than just your thoughts and reactions. The past is behind you and the future can't be seen - but you have so much power to tap into in this very moment. Anchor yourself to the "gift" of the present. Stay strong, friend.

djeco [info] It really does consume your life.. But hang in there buddy. I was diagnosed with anxiety a few years back and it was hell. The thing is I wasn't worried about things like social anxiety, but rather the fear it self. The heart beat, sufication, swetty palms, the feeling of lost. It always started in my legs and build itself out, that tingling sensation. After a time I was done with it. I remembered having a dream of me training, boxing and training MMA. Don't know why I dreamed it, never been into fighting myself, but I liked to watch it. For some reason I woke up happy, happier that I've been for many months. I looked myself in the mirror that day and wanted to take control, like really bad, to a sensation that even got me mad at myself. I started researching, read other stories, tried out things that worked, other things didn't work, started training a little bit, worked on my breathing techniques, etc. When the therapist said that I didn't had to go to therapy anymore because I was healthy was like removing the  biggest chains in my life. I even got to a fuck it, I don't care anymore. You build yourself into this cage, and the only person that can unlock it is you.  [info] None [info] 1547969012
td_bot2 [info] Is it just me, or does Sean Spicer strike you as an empathetic being with a big heart? I hope this is the right place for this post. I apologize in advance for the length of this, and also for the possible grammatical errors.The following is my own opinion:It seems as if Sean Spicer's position does not suite him well (his suits don't fit him well either lol (pun intended)). Anyway, when I watch him speak, I can easily see that he is tense and also speaks with a defensive tone. However, watching him speak for the past few months has made me wonder a few things, and I would like to know your personal opinions about Sean.I believe that in real life, he is a person with a very big heart, and has the ability to feel empathy. Which is very different from the rest of Trump's cabinet, and others close to Trump (as far as I can tell, but I could be very wrong). Right off the bat, I noticed he was very different.In my own life, I was diagnosed with anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) at age 8, and have been living with it, embracing it, and have helped others with it. Due to this, I am usually very good at sensing when people are experiencing even the slightest of anxiety. To me, Sean Spicer gives off this vibe, yet at the same time I feel that he really tries to do his best. Although, more recently I feel he is becoming fed up with his job. Trump has been in office for over 50 days so far, and it sure has been a hell of a roller coaster ride, so I could understand if Sean is fed up with it all.I see the bracelet he wears (the rainbow colored one) which says "DAD" in the middle of it. According to what I have read online, his children made this bracelet for him. The fact that he wears this everywhere (especially the fact that he is not afraid of being seen with rainbow colors, which for some I assume could be misleading if they didn't notice the "DAD" on the bracelet) is extremely heartwarming and comforting. He is genuine in this way. He also may not spending nearly as much time with his children as he did before the Trump era. He probably misses them very much, and the bracelet is a piece of their heart he wears. In regards to what he has said during press conferences, do you believe his statements to be his true opinions and feelings? Or do you feel that he is only protecting the presidents credibility because he fears losing his job? I can't help but think of the saying "don't kill the messenger", for he gives off the vibe that he would love to say that to the press. I have this funny feeling there is a whole other side to Sean that we do not see. For my last comment, the fact that he was once the "White House Easter Bunny" is pretty awesome, and I'm hoping he does it again this year (99% sure it won't happen though lol).I know that the above may not be entirely true, for most of what I wrote is my own opinion. Please correct me with sources, if necessary. Again, I apologize for the length of this and thank you for reading :)TL;DR: Sean Spicer may actually be a kind-hearted individual who may have had no idea what he was walking into when accepting his position as the White House press secretary and communications director.

ohmygoditsbeautiful [info] Nausea/Vomiting? Anyone else experience this? Hello everybodyI was diagnosed with anxiety recently (should have been a lottttttttt earlier, but anyway) and some of the worst symptoms are nausea, induced vomiting, and decreased appetite. Together, these are so not fun and fairly chronic. The nausea/vomiting usually happens before anxiety attacks and, at this point, after a lot of meals (big or small, even snacks sometimes). Does anyone have any advice to help with these symptoms? I throw up between 3-5 times a week, feel nauseous way more than that and it is a real struggle to finish any food. It is really starting to negatively affect my health :( [info] None [info] 1571095118

a_mich21 [info] Should i tell my s/o about my past physical and emotional abuse from my parents? Growing up, my mom was insane. She was both physically and mentally abusive. Dads an unreliable alcoholic. I've been in therapy on and off for two years. They all tell me i'm resilient and have good coping skills. Eventually I just ran out of things to say to my therapist. I was diagnosed with anxiety two years ago (he knows that). I'm almost fine but i just have major issues trusting people, and i'm always scared people are secretly angry at me so i ask him a lot if he is. He doesn't understand why, and he get's offended that i don't trust him. We've only been together for two months. It doesn't feel right to tell him, but at the same time, i want him to understand why i act the way i do sometimes. [info] None [info] 1553812770
Yuio6789 [info] I never even told my parents about my BPD diagnosis. They're pretty hardcore narcissists and even when I was diagnosed with anxiety they told me it wasn't a real disorder. That everyone gets anxiety. They thought my panic attacks were episodes from drug use. Then when I actually did turn to drugs years later because I couldn't cope - they caught me and they never even asked if I was okay. All they could do was tell me how embarrassing it was to be the parent of a drug addict and how I should have considered how it made them feel and look to other people when I decided to do drugs specifically to hurt their feelings. They basically turn any conversation about my problems into their problems. I only talk to them about really basic things now. Like clothes or the weather or something. I've given up trying to be close to them. [info] None [info] 1518653642

WarKittyKat [info] Unfortunately, it's also not a great idea when you're still in a relationship with an abusive person.  I think for me CBT was trying to dismantle something that was on some level still keeping me safe, without necessarily looking if there was anything I needed to be kept safe from.  Therapy seemed to proceed based on the idea that everything was safe for me then, when it was not.  And there wasn't any real check, just the fact that I was diagnosed with anxiety and needed CBT because that's the therapy for anxiety. [info] None [info] 1566609034

tiny_venus [info] Do you perhaps have anxiety? I used to get freaked out in the same way and then I’d get more freaked out wondering if it was normal. I was diagnosed with anxiety about a year and a half ago and talked this over with my counsellor who said it was a totally normal trait of anxiety. I’d just suggest to try not to get too wrapped up into it- you don’t want to start feeling paranoid and wrapped up thinking ‘oh he acted like this maybe he’s going to break up with me!’ Because that might strain the relationship.

Jokker_is_the_name [info] Ooh I feel like I can actually answer this one!I've been diagnosed with anxiety, and have had daily panic attacks for about a year (luckily they are less rare now)As far as I know, and please correct me if im wrong, it has to do with your primitive brain. There are people whos brain isnt always too sure whether they are in a real danger or not. The panic attack is often set off by an event or thought. For example someone says someting offensive, or maybe even a little weird. Then the brain gets confused, it thinks whatever a person said is dangerous for you.Most peoples brains know what is in fact actually dangerous, but some people dont. These people get panic attacks.After your brain starts to think you are in danger, you get the classic "fight-or-flight" situation. Adrenaline will be released. And your heart starts pumping faster.So, in short, you primitive brain thinks a tiger is going to attack you, while in actuality someone just said something about your shoes. You think you are in danger and either start to flight, or fight. [info] None [info] 1543140858
KitsuneExistISwear [info] I don’t know how I survived until now... I was a small anxious bean as a child. Always concerned with routines and had very specific definitions of clean. I was diagnosed with anxiety with OCD when I was 7. It’s held fairly true but a lot of therapy helped me manage it.I always prided myself on rarely getting sick. The worst I would get would be strep every couple years for a day or two. Or a head cold. This past February I managed to get the stomach flu for the first time in fifteen years. I HATE vomiting. It honestly didn’t even hit that hard and I was back to work after 2.5 days, but I hated it. I made myself get up and clean everything I could the day before I went back to work, but after that I felt okay about everything.Then 2 months ago my coworkers girlfriend got hit with food poisoning, but we didn’t know that at the time. He tried to call out 15 minutes prior to his shift because she would be home alone and he didn’t want to leave her home sick. My boss told him he can’t leave us high and dry like that and to come in, and my stomach twisted itself into knots. Cue the start of my misery.I now have to leave the house with almost all my skin covered, all clothes immediately go into the hamper upon arrival back home and I scrub my arms to the elbows just in case. I no longer want to go on dates or go out at all after work because I feel so anxious and uncomfortable. I only want to go out on my days off. I sanitize everything at work as best I can at the end of the day. Logically, I know that getting sick is a part of life and even despite my lesser standard of clean I somehow managed to avoid it for the past 15 years. Logically, I know that if I just wash my hands before I eat with soap and water avoid touching my face and use hand sanitizer if I touch something gross I’ll be okay. I know this. But my head doesn’t. Everything is dirty. People are dirty and disgusting until proven otherwise. Things are loath to be touched. I hate it. I hate that this is my life now.I just started therapy but it took a while because my insurance is an asshole. I just had my first session this week and I’m so frustrated. I know it’s not reasonable for me to expect major change because we JUST started working together, but I’m so ready to be DONE. This is exhausting. The low level of stress that can get rocketed up at the drop of the hat sucks. The fact that my coworker can just describe that they have a stomachache and I immediately panic to the point that I’m sent home is AWFUL. I feel out of control and I just want to sob.I just want to cry. I’m tired. I’m done. I don’t know how I managed to live before this. I don’t know how I can go on. I know it will get better because it has to. But I feel like I need it to be now because I don’t know how else I’m gonna live through the rest of the year. TL; DR: I’m tired. I’m done. Therapy is a start, but I’m ready to just become a hermit. [info] None [info] 1560396268
Cumberblep [info] Just remember you're not alone and not to be ashamed to get help. I spent a lot of angst filled time in my teens and twenties feeling ashamed and helpless. I've posted some more information below. Everyone always thinks of binge purge or not eating at all as an eating disorder. Sometimes you just binge. There are also a lot of connections between eating disorders and OCD.https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/expert-opinion-eating-disorders-and-ocd/https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/bedI've been diagnosed with anxiety by previous physicians but none of them tied it to OCD. So I have some OCD behaviors related to finishing things. For example, I would stay at work for 36 hours straight to finish basic work. I would not sleep during  finals week of college because I was so worried I wasn't ready because I didn't know every bit of everything. So like 4 days, no sleep. So lots of sleepless nights. Lots of worrying about things not being  done. So if started eating something I couldn't stop until it was finished. Sometimes to the point where it made me physically Ill. I would wait until I didn't feel bad and then eat some more.  It's hard to explain now. Especially now that the meds and counseling have me disconnected from those feelings. I also became emotionally connected to food. Like good times called for some crazy over eating and then bad times called for the same. Binge eating disorder (BED) is a severe, life-threatening, and treatable eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of eating large quantities of food (often very quickly and to the point of discomfort); a feeling of a loss of control during the binge; experiencing shame, distress or guilt afterwards; and not regularly using unhealthy compensatory measures (e.g., purging) to counter the binge eating. It is the most common eating disorder in the United States.Numerous studies have now shown that those with eating disorders have statistically higher rates of OCD (11% – 69%), and vice versa (10% – 17%). As recently as 2004, Kaye, et al., reported that 64% of individuals with eating disorders also possess at least one anxiety disorder, and 41% of these individuals have OCD in particular.   [info] None [info] 1551631741

little_kid13 [info] What is life like with schizo? I saw a psychiatrist due to some of my symptoms were similar to schizophrenia, but it turned out that I was diagnosed with anxiety, and now I take meds for anxiety and feel alot better. But a part of me worries that I might get it when I'm older, (like those schizophrenia stories about a normal college kid that experiences a sudden onset of psychosis and schizo) and I worry that may happen to me. I keep telling myself that it's probably my anxiety just acting up, but then I thought, if I do get schizo when I'm older, how would I live well? I wouldn't be able to attend school, college, uni or work and then I won't be able to do well or sustain my job, then I'll  become a hobo and die early. But for you guys, how do you live with schizo? How do you keep your job and how do you do in school etc? Don't you worry about it? About missing out and losing everything?

HappyFawn836131 [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety and add at the same time, I’ve never had any actual problems before this. My doctor prescribed be strattera. Me and my mom did a ton of research all over the internet to find out about this drug. And we both firmly decided we didn’t want it. My mom and doctor then came to the consluison of a script of 60x 10mg adderal irs. She encouraged us to mess with the dosage and tweak it just right and such (Mom held the bottle, I didn’t get the chance). They both believed that my anxiety stemmed from my add, therefore causing me to get anxious. 2 months later and not a drip of anxiety left in my body... I don’t know what do tell you man, but the best explanation in my opinion would be that everyone’s body is built differently, and no drug will effect anyone exactly the same way...

pixelated_dreamer [info] Vain Vicky and Controlling Charlie in: How To Set Your Kid Up For Failure Hi all, it's finals season for this sad college gay and that brought up an old memory. Vain Vicky and Controlling Charlie are my very JNParents who are obsessed with appearances and enjoy controlling me, respectively. I have a bad habit of not asking for help when I need it. This has a slight tendency to blow up in my face and lead to screaming fits from CC. During one of them, CC screamed "Why do you always have to be so independent?!" So I decided to do an investigative trip down memory lane.I suck at math. It just isn't my strong suit; anything beyond the basic makes my head spin. So in high school I would do kind of poorly in math classes. CC and VV were having none of this. They're both engineers. They were told they'd make smart babies, dammit! So they set to work "fixing" me.They forced me to stay after school with the math teacher every day for extra help. Really I'd just put my headphones on and do my homework. It was an exercise in futility, but I didn't complain too much because she gave out candy. So whatever, kept me out of that hell house and got me free candy. But ot wasn't enough. I didn't miraculously get straight A+'s in math, so CC decided to do more. He would go online and print out hundreds of extra problems and hover over my shoulder as I did them, screaming at me for every mistake. Fun fact, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. So you can imagine this just made me mess up more, which made him yell more.... it was a vicious cycle. If I recall I made it through that year somewhere in the B range (no thanks to CC's "help"). So CC, deciding to get ahead of things that summer, bought me some math book FOR GIRLS! (because everything needs to be excessively gendered for CC... I want to say it was called "Girls Love Curves!" or something equally vom worthy) And instructed me to spend my summer studying it. Needless to say I did not.This lovely cycle would repeat itself ad infinitum until I finished math classes. I now HATE math. Can't stand it. And I think we've arrived at the answer to CC's screamed question! When you use something as punishment, your damn kid will not actively seek it out! Thanks for deeply breaking me, guys.

Lionflower13 [info] Me.But, it's getting better since I have started taking ADD meds. I was diagnosed with anxiety first and given medication to help with it. I was still getting overwhelmed because I couldn't tell when I was taking on too many things in my life (inability to regulate).And, transitions kicked my ass. Always. I could go to the gym for six solid weeks, get sick for 5 days, and never go back to the gym because my groove was thrown off. And, forget going from writing instructions to suddenly being interrupted for an emergency meeting. All that did was put me in a foul mood because I liked my hyperfocusing.After being diagnosed with ADD and placed on the appropriate meds, I am better able to adapt to transitions and uncomfortable environment, but it's taking longer than I thought to get to a point where I no longer need the anxiety meds. It has been 6 months, and I keep making progress, but it's baby steps. [info] ADHD and Parent [info] 1366666500

FHRITP69er [info] I was just diagnosed with anxiety. I had no idea what it was like before. I just thought people were nervous like a test. At least for me that just mild. It's more like if I'm going to live the next day because something must be wrong with me. It doesn't make sense that I can just sit innocently on my couch, watching a movie, eating dinner, and all of a sudden I look at my girlfriend and tell her I think i'm going to die.I sustained a leg injury from a back injury (sciatica maybe) and it just got so bad. Slept for maybe 1-2 hours total for 2 weeks when my leg issue started. Then randomly, I remember just talking to my physio therapist to help my sciatica and just before we even started, I remember a huge ringing in my ear, and then my head got super cloudy and almost felt dense. I just felt like life was leaving my body and told her I think my heart stopped. She laid me down seconds away from passing out. That was the first time. The second time, on the couch, and my heart was minimum 100bpm for no reason. And I remember panicking as fuck. Telling her not to let me die. Telling her to call my mom. What do I do. Do I call 911? I called my mom. Voice was shaking uncontrollably, trying to be as calm as possible. Fiancé instructing me to breathe as she rubs my back. I can't stop telling her I love her. Mom says go to the hospital now. I say I can't make it. I get off the phone. Call 911. Ambulance is at my house in 4 minutes. I'm laying on the couch now. I'm hooked up to their EKG, and they were insanely calm. Told me I'm going to be okay and I'm not having a heart attack. I'm not going to die. They administered my prescribed/Rx Lorazepam and swallowed. Heart rate went down... They said they don't need to take me to the hospital because it's not life threatening, so I signed my waiver and took their word for it.Since then, I caved and made a large post on social media for anyone on my friends list. I barely use Facebook but I creep alot just to stay up to date. This was a 3:30 in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Any time I try to sleep is my nightmare because that's when my walls come down. Idle hands and mind are the devils playground. So all day, all night I just wonder if I'm gonna make it. So so so many people reached out to me, and told me that I'm okay. And that they too have never told anyone they have been dealing with it for years. They thought they were alone. I thought I was alone. I cried for the first time in maybe 5 years. I cried hard. I just want to live. I'm crying as I type this.It made me so humble. I held my fiancé closer. I just celebrated my 5 year anniversary together with her and she's my rock. I think i'm going to be okay. Every day is a struggle.

I won’t lie to you I’ve had a few trips where I got a little uneasy at times but it’s nothing a good distraction won’t fix lol. Find yourself some good shit to watch on tv, or get some various arts and crafts to do, music is also a must. Solo tripping is very rewarding. You’ll be fine :-) I took 200ug about 20 minutes ago so here I go again! [info] None [info] 1561086866
missjulia928 [info] It wasn't really a tantrum. I'd just cry uncontrollably and try to run away from the situation. When you are 6 and have an anxiety attack, you have zero idea how to cope with it. It's scary enough for an adult most of the time. I was diagnosed with anxiety at 10 and finally started to learn coping methods through therapy.  [info] None [info] 1426478174

onawall [info] I do encourage him to stand up for himself, and he does tell them to stop, but they dont. And before Jake had said that to me, I thought of him very highly. We had gone to a fair and he had been teasing us because we were fresh in the relationship and were anxious. When we were going home, in the car, Jake had said something about us holding hands. And so we did. After that we stopped being anxious and that led to the next level of our relationship. I thought he was really cool until he said that about me. And I'm not insecure, I'm diagnosed with anxiety and when I hear people are saying things about me it triggers my anxiety. I just want to be on the down low. [info] None [info] 1555358973
ChiknNuget [info] Can ARFID be triggered by a some-what traumatic childhood event? Howdy! Firstly, I think it’s important to let you guys know I haven’t been professionally diagnosed yet. I feel I match up perfectly well and really hope to get a formal diagnosis in the future! I was wondering if ARFID can be triggered by some type of semi-traumatic event in childhood? Long story short; when I was about two I ended up in hospital for a week or two with salmonella and a few other nasty digestive/stomach bugs. I threw up basically anything I ate and cried a whole lot. Before that, I was the least fussiest kid a kid could be. I would try anything. However, when I was in hospital I stopped eating anything except for chicken nuggets and chips (fries). I’m not sure if that was the only food I could keep down or not. But after I was released from the hospital, I stayed extremely restrictive on my chicken nugget and chips. I would completely freak out and hyperventilate over any other food going near me. This lasted around 8 more years until I slowly added a few more things into my diet. I expanded to other chicken (tenders, burgers with just the meat and bun) etc, beef (sausages, sausage rolls) etc and stuck with potato. Everything else was filled in with cereal and other sugary stuff. For a really long time growing up, I was underweight and short. Now I’m turning 18 this year and have added a few more things to my diet including shrimp, nachos (just the beef and cheese of course 😛) and a few other close “branches” of those foods. I’m now on the ender side of the “ideal weight” chart but I’m still really short. Which isn’t fun since now I’m in uni, I’m still misunderstood as a kid who’s lost haha (but on the plus side, no one questions me if I order off the kids menu). I have been diagnosed with anxiety and that plays a huge role in trying new food. I am absolutely petrified of trying anything new. It mostly has to do with me being afraid of texture than taste, but taste has a huge role in any food being considered to be “tried”. I am honestly tired of living like this and would give up and arm or a leg to have a normal diet. I’m lacking in so many vitamins like B12 and I’m constantly tired. I want to get help but the thought of having someone push me to try new foods makes me avoid it even more. I was wondering if being sick as a kid caused this? As some type of traumatic (defiantly not as traumatic as most things) event? I’m not so much scared of throwing up the food now, but I know deep down, the fear of trying new food is because of early childhood troubles with it (the salmonella and the other virus). I’d love your guys thoughts. I’m so thankful to have found this sub. Although not diagnosed, I do consider myself to have ARFID and will try my best to get a proper diagnosis. I’m just so glad to know I’m not the only one :) [info] None [info] 1523455073

phorensic [info] I was diagnosed with anxiety/panic disorder 7 or 8 years ago. I used to have panic attacks while driving to work. I had a big one that sent me to the ER while I was walking in the parking lot. Complete tunnel vision and total disorientation. I had no idea who I even was at that point, let alone have the ability to drive. I can imagine a scenario when having a panic attack you get to the point of passing out, which would be potentially lethal to you, passengers, and other people on the road. So yes, it would be the same as having one in a plane, the same potential consequences. Is one life worth less than 100+ on a plane? It has the same weight in my view. You might have been able to pull over "safely" while having a panic attack, but can others?? You should think a little harder about this. [info] None [info] 1540493143

TalkOfSexualPleasure [info] Personally I'm diagnosed with anxiety.  I'm very particular with who I tell that to (barring Reddit because of the anonymity) because if I feel like people are patronizing me it makes my anxiety worse.  There are some people who push the envelope for no other reason than attention, but grouping all of us into that category really hurts the ones of us who suffer silently to ourselves.  I personally have the fear of telling someone about my condition and being told they know better than my doctor's or told I'm out right lying, because my symptoms aren't visible, but personally my symptoms don't come out around anyone, they're clawing at the back of my mind, but in front of people my mind goes into go mode and decides no one can see how dysfunctional I am.  The muscles in my back will clench to the point of pain, my shoulders will cramp, and I can be all but having panic attack and yet I won't break.  The second I'm by myself, I can't breath, I can't think, I'm pacing, yanking at my hair, screaming, crying, and even praying to a god I don't believe in to make it stop.  And it never stops, it never goes away, it gets better, smaller, for at least a little while, but it never ever goes away. [info] None [info] 1552359370
diamonds_diamonds [info] Anti- Social behavior with extreme irritability normal towards end of deployment??? I'm not sure if this is normal, or maybe deployment behavior.I'm pretty sure I'm that percentage my unit thinks where I'm gonna throw myself off a building when we get back. These last few months have been HARD, when talking to family and loved ones. I don't want to talk with anyone really and the only person I can tolerate BARELY is my Best Friend back home.Not my mother. Not my father.

It's almost as if every other thing he says makes a tick go off in my head. I am diagnosed with anxiety and I know extreme irritability is something that surfaces for me with it, but I can't seem to KNOW what I'm having anxiety about. It just seems that people in general are just ANNOYING. Maybe I'm just worried about integrating back into civilian life?No matter what National Guard says, THEY DO NOT LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

When I get back, I don't even plan on contacting anyone honestly and just keep to myself for a few weeks.I let my line leader know already what to expect just so no one from my section goes calling the police or putting out some missing persons report.

refugefirstmate [info] First, call the number on the back of your insurance card to see whether you need a referral from your doctor or not.  Generally with psychiatric care, you don't.Next: County mental health center. Make an appointment.  They charge on a sliding scale, they take insurance, and there are lots of different practitioners in one place. And they have seen everything more than once, believe me, so don't feel weird about needing therapy at all.  IME the problem with goign to a private practitioner is that it's a crapshoot, and some of the therapists out there need help themselves.  (As I left an intial session with one after telling her we weren't a good fit, she sadly called out "But I *like* you!"  uh no)You'll have an intake interview to find out what your treatment goals are and the kind of therapist you think would be a good fit.  Then you'll get an appointment with a therapist.After a couple therapist meetings you'll see a psychiatrist, who reviews the therapist's notes and talks to you and makes a recommendation for what anxiety meds might be useful to you. You choose to take them, or not.Then you continue to see the therapist, learning new ways of thinking, usually once a week, and the psychiatrist after another month to see how the meds are working or if the type of dosage needs tweaking (it usually does).  Once you're on a satisfactory med schedule, you see the psychiatrist only every 3 months or so.  Your therapy can continue until you decide you've achieved what you want, which means it can be half a dozen sessions or a couple years.If you don't click with the first therapist, you can always discuss switching to another one so that your sessions will be more productive.Remember:  Therapy is only as good as you make it.  It's *hard work*. Don't just show up, unload or passively sit there, and then go back to your old thinking as soon as you leave.  Really make those sessions count.I was diagnosed with anxiety at age 50. Yeah, I waited that long.  Good on you for not being me.

Colonel-Rosa [info] I was treated badly for mental illness in the UK. Some GPs are far better than others though.

VictoriousssBIG23 [info] I am diagnosed with anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and PTSD. While I still struggle when I'm sober, I find that weed helps me be more in touch with the emotions of other people and how my actions affect theirs and vice versa. It also helps keep me calm because the BPD causes rapid mood swings including periods of intense anger or sadness, but stoned me is always happy and go-with-the-flow. It also helps me with PTSD related nightmares because I don't dream when I smoke before bed. I don't have the urge to self-injure when I smoke. However, I've been experiencing more anxiety and paranoia lately when I smoke. For years, it was the opposite. I was always relaxed and calm, but lately, my anxiety's gotten bad and idk what it is, really. I think part of it has to do with the legal status. It's not legal in my state yet so I get scared that someone in the hallway of my apartment building will smell it and report me for it or if I'm at home, I'm afraid that my parents will catch me with it. But I also experience anxiety sometimes even if there's good vibes around so idk. This didn't start happening until around this time last year so maybe my body chemistry changed? I still very much enjoy weed and the positive benefits I get from it. The anxiety is just an inconvenience at this point that I hope gets resolved.  [info] None [info] 1515398264

TotesNotYourStalker [info] Medicated for Anxiety, but I still can't force myself to do certain things. How do I change that? I was diagnosed with anxiety probably 10 years ago. I've been on lexapro for probably 6ish years now, taking 20mg a day (recently upped from 10mg). My general anxiety is alright, I don't get as stressed when I have lots of homework, I have been in a more chipper mood, and I haven't had a panic attack since I started taking my medicine years ago. However, there are still some things I just can't get past:1. I get terrified to answer the phone when almost anyone calls. I'll make exceptions for my immediately family, sometimes dr's, but otherwise, I let it go to VM every other time.2. I almost panic when someone knocks on my door during the day, when my husband is working and my daughter is in school. I still sneak around to see who it is, but still hide until they leave, unless it's immediately family.3. My 7 year old daughter desperately wants to have friends over to play with her toys but I can't fathom the idea of being responsible for someone elses kid for that long. It's stupid though because I babysit my brothers kid, and best friends baby, all the time.How do I get past stuff like this? Is it an anxiety issue I'm dealing with or something totally different here? I feel crazy getting so anxious about someone knocking on my door or wanting to play with my kid. It's exhausting.Help!

Trusty_Sidekick [info] Some people are born blind, or with heart defects, or with any other of the slew of biological short-comings out there. Do many of those people still survive? Absolutely. But do we at least recognize that their abnormal condition is exactly that? Yes. If you had to send two human beings to another ELP to propagate the human race, would you send two homosexual men, or one heterosexual woman and one heterosexual man? There's a biological reason for that. Do I have a problem with non-heterosexual people in society? Absolutely not! I have a handful of gay friends, my fiance is bi-sexual, and a cousin of mine is transgender. I am totally accepting of all of them. But to argue that heterosexuality should not be classified as "normal biological function" is stupid. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and OCD and am on medication for those. Should I be offended if people tell me that those aren't "normal" functions of the brain? Nope, and I don't. I embrace it as a part of who I am. [info] None [info] 1424901227

HowdoIreddittellme [info] It depends on a number of factors: age, comprehension of what they are being told, belief that such abnormalities make someone "weak" or "broken". In my personal life, I was diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety at 9 and 13 respectively. When I was diagnosed with ADHD at 9, it didn't mean much to me, I was nine, I wanted to watch TV and play. However at 13, when I was diagnosed with anxiety, it was somewhat crushing. I thought it meant I couldn't cope with life, and that I needed help that other kids didn't, that I couldn't keep up.If someone who received the news that they had some kind of mental condition or abnormality was raised in a family that taught that mental illness wasn't to a thing to be ashamed of, that it was ok, they might react like they would if they were told they had a physical disease. However, if you were raised to believe that mental illness meant you were weak, it might be a death blow to self esteem. [info] None [info] 1497444580
rowrowyothrowaway [info] Yes. Go to the doctor. Or maybe even better, go to a therapist. You *do not* have to live this way. Medical professionals can help you understand what's going on in your body and give you coping methods. That doesn't mean they'll *cure* it, but they can absolutely help. I would recommend *not* talking to your parents about it until you know what to talk to them about. Lots of times, if you say "I feel worried all the time," people will tell you to just not worry. They don't mean to be hurtful, but it is! It will be better if you can go to them and tell them what you need to be well. Say, "I was diagnosed with anxiety. Here's what that means. Here's what makes me worried, if anything. Here's how you can help me."  [info] None [info] 1525275992

inalotofemotions [info] Why does my boyfriend have such difficulty with words, memory, and language? Note: I'm not asking this in a "my boyfriend is broken and needs to be fixed" sort of way. It's something that bothers him and he wants to work on, when I wonder if it's just part of his personality, or temperament. I'm just interested in having a non-judgemental conversation about it.So everyone will have those occasional moments when they forget a word mid-sentence, have to substitute a synonym, or ask for the word - those moments when it feels like your brain's recall system just isn't working a little. If I had to guess, I'd say it happens to me about once per week? Maybe less? It happens to me more often if I'm having a conversation with a stranger and worried about being judged or anxious, but it still doesn't happen to often.It happens to my boyfriend multiple times per conversation, even when he's not anxious. He's also much more forgetful than I am, and tends to misplace things quite frequently - at least once per week, he'll tell me he can't find some object that he uses most days (keys, wallet, etc). I misplace things like that quite rarely - when I do misplace them, it's due to some disruption in my regular routine.I think both these things are sort of parts of our personalities? For my whole life, I've liked to do things slowly, deliberately, methodically. I don't tend to talk a lot because I'm a bit on the shy side, though extraverted and comfortable around non-strangers. I'm sort of reserved, but I purposefully do things when I want to do them. I HATE being hurried and rushed - one boundary I had to set with my BF early on is that he needs to let me SLOWLY enjoy things sometimes (especially my mornings). I am this way because I've always been quite anxious (to the point where I've been diagnosed with anxiety), and I feel best when I slow down and act very deliberately. I pay lots of attention to my environment due to the amxiety as well - I almost never get "tunnel-vision".My boyfriend is basically an excited and passionate introvert! And I absolutely love that about him. He latches on to things he likes or wants to do and dives right in - he doesn't seem to worry about failure when trying new things. He's confident and self-assured in a way I'm not, which I think leads him to be more comfortable without needing to slow down and be deliberate in the way I need to - and I think this is why he misplaces objects and words more than I do.We're both the sort of people who try to practice mindful meditation, so that's not it, I don't think. I don't think it's solely anxiety because I'm typically much more anxious than him. I might be completely off-base with this guess - maybe it doesn't have to do with personality at all? That's why I'm curious to talk about it.Do you forget words or misplace things often? What's your personality like? What do you think is the reason for something like this?
